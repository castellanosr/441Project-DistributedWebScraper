The Saluki"s origins are shrouded in the sands of time, but his history is believed to go back to antiquity. He is the very definition of grace and speed, well deserving of the name bestowed on him by his Arab breeders — The Noble. The Saluki is bred for speed, strength, and endurance, qualities that are evident in his long, narrow head and sleek yet muscular body. Beautiful but reserved, the Saluki is affectionate without being overly demonstrative. He"s happy to prove his loyalty through quiet companionship. Not everyone is offered the gift of a Saluki"s devoted friendship, but those happy few who receive it are appreciative of the honor. Salukis are widely admired for their exotic appearance, but not everyone is well suited to live with this spirited and independent hunter. Any movement, be it a squirrel, cat, or radio-controlled car, will activate the Saluki"s instinct to chase, and his speed has been clocked at 30 to 35 miles per hour. Unless he"s protected by a strong human on the other end of the leash or a securely fenced yard, he"s likely to meet his end beneath the wheels of a car. You might think that Salukis living in the country would have fewer issues, but they"ve been known to chase down and tangle with or kill goats, otters, foxes, raccoons, snakes, squirrels, and deer. To keep a Saluki safe and well exercised, provide him with 300 to 400 lateral feet of fenced area where he can run full out. If your yard isn"t that large, you should have easy access to a fenced park, an enclosed sports field at a school, or a beach with no nearby road. On leash, the Saluki makes an excellent jogging companion — if you can keep up with him. He"s also a good competitor in agility and lure coursing. Some Salukis participate in obedience and tracking as well. Indoors, the Saluki will make himself at home on your soft sofa or bed. He likes his comforts and needs cushioning for his somewhat bony body. Using his long, skinny muzzle, he"ll surf your kitchen counters in search of anything edible. The calm and gentle Saluki can become timid and shy without early socialization and regular reinforcement through new experiences and introductions to many different people throughout his life. Generally quiet but alert, he"s a good watchdog, but not a guard dog. Salukis are fearless in the hunt but otherwise unaggressive. Training a Saluki is possible, but don"t expect the perfect obedience you might have from a Golden Retriever. Salukis think for themselves, and if something else is more interesting than what you"re asking them to do, they"re perfectly happy to ignore you. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, never harsh verbal or physical corrections. Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. While Salukis aren"t overly demonstrative, they do become strongly attached to their people and dislike being left alone for long periods. Consider a Saluki if you have time to give to a devoted, graceful friend who can run like the wind.
Salukis love to run and need regular daily exercise. They must be kept on leash whenever they"re not in a securely fenced area. They have a strong prey drive and will pursue anything furry and in motion, heedless of their owner"s commands. Salukis are a reserved breed although they"re devoted to their people. Early and ongoing socialization is important for this breed to prevent shyness and skittishness. Salukis are not recommended for apartments. They require a large fenced yard where they can run safely. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended; their prey drive is so strong they"ll push past it. It is important to provide comfortable bedding for a Saluki since he doesn"t have enough body fat to provide padding. Salukis should not live outdoors. They thrive on human companionship and will become depressed if left alone for long periods. Although these dogs can make gentle and calm companions for older children, they are not recommended for homes with small children. Salukis are generally quiet dogs. When training a Saluki, be consistent, and use only positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, since the breed is so sensitive. Salukis are fastidious and like to be clean. They shed little and require only weekly brushing. Salukis should not reside in homes that have small pets. Even with the best training, a Saluki will view small pets as prey and will try to hunt them. Salukis prefer the companionship of other Salukis, but they can get along with other dogs that do not have dominant natures. Salukis can be picky eaters. Never buy a Saluki from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
Once known as the Persian Greyhound or the gazelle hound, the Saluki has long been considered one of the most ancient of breeds. Recent genetic evidence confirms this to be the case. Scientists speculate that Salukis and other ancient breeds descend from the first dogs and made their way through the world with their nomadic owners. Depictions of dogs resembling Salukis — with a Greyhoundlike body and feathering on the ears, tail, and legs — appear on Egyptian tombs dating to 2100 B.C.E., some 4,000 years ago. Even older are carvings from the Sumerian empire (7,000-6,000 B.C.E.) that show dogs with a striking resemblance to the Saluki. Pharaohs hunted gazelles and hares with Salukis, which often worked in partnership with falcons. The dogs were frequently honored with mummification after death. Nomadic Muslims, who generally despised dogs as unclean animals, considered Salukis a gift from Allah and referred to the dogs by the honorific El Hor, meaning The Noble. Salukis were the only dogs permitted to sleep inside the tents. The breed may take its name from the ancient city of Saluk, in Yemen, or perhaps from the city of Seleukia in Syria. Another theory suggests that the name is a transliteration of the Arabic word for hound. Salukis were widespread in the Middle East and could be found in Persia (modern-day Iran), Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia. The first documented case of Salukis arriving in Britain was in 1840, but it wasn"t until after World War I, when many British officers returned with them from the Middle East, that the breed became established in Great Britain. Interest in the Saluki was slower to take hold in the United States. The Saluki Club of America was founded in 1927, the same year the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Saluki registered by the AKC was Jinniyat of Grevel in 1929. Today the Saluki is a rare treasure, ranking 116th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Saluki males stand 23 to 28 inches at the shoulder; females are significantly smaller. Weight ranges from 35 to 70 pounds.
The Saluki is an aloof dog, but one who"s devoted to his family. He"s gentle and thrives on quiet companionship. He has a tendency to bond with a single person, which can lead to separation anxiety. With strangers, Salukis are reserved, and they can be shy if they"re not socialized at an early age. Socialization should continue throughout their life. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They"re sensitive dogs and will pick up on and become stressed by tensions in the home. Salukis love comfort and enjoy being pampered with soft bedding and access to furniture. Like cats, they"re fastidious about personal cleanliness. Like every dog, Salukis need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saluki puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
The Saluki is a hardy breed that does not suffer from many genetically inherited diseases. The following problems may be seen in Salukis: Anesthesia Sensitivity: Because of their low level of body fat, sighthounds such as the Saluki have a reputation for being sensitive to anesthesia and certain other drugs. Fortunately, the new drugs available these days have properties that make sighthound reactions to drugs much less likely. In addition, most veterinarians are aware of the special anesthesia and drug needs of sighthounds, but it never hurts to confirm this awareness if you"re taking your Saluki to a new veterinarian. Hemangiosarcoma: This malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels and the spleen. Cardiomyopathy: This disease of the heart muscle takes two forms: dilated and hypertrophic. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the progressive enlargement of the ventricles, the heart"s main pumping chambers. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes a drastic increase in heart muscle mass. DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and tends to affect young to middle-aged males in larger breeds. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Salukis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for cardiac (heart) and thyroid disease. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Salukis are not suited for apartment life. They need a home with a large, securely fenced yard where they can run flat out. The ideal running area for a Saluki is 300 to 400 feet in length or width. Fences should be at least five to six feet high or a Saluki will easily jump them. Underground electronic fencing will not contain a Saluki, nor will it protect him from other animals that might enter your yard. Keep your Saluki on leash whenever he"s not in an enclosed area. A Saluki was bred for hunting and has a strong prey drive. If he sees anything fast and furry, he"ll pursuit it for as long as he can, disregarding any commands to come or stop. Salukis are indoor dogs and require soft, cushioned bedding to prevent calluses from forming. Place food well out of reach of the Saluki"s inquiring nose. That means behind closed doors or up about seven feet. Salukis are intelligent and learn quickly, but they"re also independent and can be stubborn, which makes training a challenge. To hold your Saluki"s attention, keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. If a Saluki becomes bored, he will choose not to learn. Use positive reinforcement, never harsh verbal or physical corrections.
Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Salukis are the supermodels of the dog world and can be picky eaters. Remember that they are supposed to look sleek, and you may just barely see the outline of their ribs beneath their skin. For more on feeding your Saluki, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Saluki has a short, smooth, silky body coat. The entire body can be smooth, or the Saluki can have slight feathering on the legs, the backs of the thighs and sometimes the shoulders, and the underside of the tail. The long ears are covered with silky hair. Salukis come in white, cream, fawn, golden, grizzle and tan, black and tan, and tricolor (white, black, and tan). The pigmentation of the nose is black or liver. Salukis are a clean, low-shedding breed with no doggy odor. Brush the coat weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Comb feathering once or twice a week to remove tangles. A wipedown with a damp cloth is generally enough to keep your Saluki clean, so bathe him only if he"s dirty. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Saluki"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Saluki jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Saluki used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They won"t chase small dogs or cats in their own household, but other animals, such as pet birds, mice, rabbits, or hamsters could prove too much of a temptation.

Dog Breed Group:  Terrier DogsHeight:  9 inches to 10 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  11 to 12 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
If you"re seeking a lively canine companion who is fearless, yet affectionate, the Norfolk Terrier may be the breed for you. With a perky, outgoing personality, and tireless constitution, the 12-pound Norfolk charms those who know and love him. Never boring, and certainly no couch potato, he is all terrier--tenacious, independent, hard-working, and charming. The Norfolk is also incredibly cute. With small, dark eyes sparkling with mischief, and a scruffy, wiry coat, it"s difficult to resist his appeal. Norfolk Terriers have been known by different names over the years. They were called Cantab Terriers when Cambridge University students used to keep them as pets. They also have been called Trumpington Terriers, after a street in the area where the breed was developed. For a while, they were even called Jones Terriers, named after the man who first exported them to the United States. In 1932, the English Kennel Club called them Norwich Terriers because at the time, the Norwich and the Norfolk were considered the same breed. Norwich Terriers and Norfolk Terriers do look very much alike. The easiest way to tell them apart is by their ears: Norwich Terriers" are upright, and Norfolks" are folded. The Norfolk is relatively uncommon in the United States. Fewer than 300 puppies are born per year in America. Litters are small. So if you want a Norfolk, expect to wait up to one year. Even though the Norfolk is small, he is very strong. At 9 to 10 inches tall and weighing just 11 to 12 pounds, you might think this happy little canine is a lap dog who wants pampering. Far from it. While he is affectionate and loves his family, a Norfolk Terrier is always ready for the chase, whether it"s vermin or fox. Because of his courage and ability to scrap with the best of foes, the Norfolk is allowed "honor scars" in the show ring to attest to his field worthiness. Norfolk Terriers have steady, live-and-let-live personalities. They generally have a happy attitude and make a reliable companion for children if they"ve been raised with them. They"re not known for being yappy, but they will bark when the need arises. If left alone outside for long periods of time or not given enough exercise, however, the Norfolk will amuse himself by barking and digging. Give your playful Norfolk a lot of toys and activities to occupy his mind, or he will find his own entertainment. As with all terriers, Norfolks should be kept on leash when in public areas because their strong hunting instinct is easily triggered by the sight of a squirrel, rabbit, or other small animal dashing by. If you choose a Norfolk, be prepared to have him as a part of your family for a very long time. These are hardy dogs that have been known to live into their late teens, still active and happily playing with their toys.
The Norfolk Terrier can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is highly recommended. Norfolks are energetic dogs who like a lot of activity so make sure he"s included in the household action as much as possible. Do not allow a Norfolk off leash in unsecured areas because you never know when his instinct to chase will kick in. The Norfolk is not yappy, but he will bark if he thinks something is amiss or if he"s bored. The Norfolk is passionate about digging. Fencing should be sunk one foot deep and checked regularly for escape holes. Some Norfolk Terriers become obese if fed too much and exercised too little. Do not indulge his desire for more food. Don"t expect to call a Norfolk breeder Tuesday and buy a puppy on Thursday. You may have to wait as long as a year for one.
The Norfolk was originally bred to hunt and kill vermin in barns. Both the Norfolk, and the Norwich Terrier, were once both called Norwich Terriers, distinguished only by their ears--the Norwich"s pricked ones and the Norfolk"s dropped ones. The breed that would later come to be the Norfolk was developed in near the towns of Norfolk and Norwich in England in the early 1800s as a general farm dog and hunter. Many believe it was developed by crossing Border Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and Irish Terriers. In the late 19th century, the reputation of the small terriers as ratters grew. Students at Cambridge University brought some to help with their rat problems and the little dogs became known first as Cantab Terriers, and later as Trumpington Terriers. One of the early breeders of Norfolk/Norwich terriers was Jodrell Hopkins, a Cambridge student who had a livery stable on Trumpington Street after he graduated. Along with "Doggy" Lawrence, a Cambridge dog dealer, he bred and sold the lively little dogs to Cambridge students. At that time, most of the little terriers were red. Several breeders began to refine the breed: Frank Jones, who was responsible for giving the breed the name of Norwich, and R.J. Read, one of the first exporters of the breed and the first president of the Norwich Terrier Club in England. One of the dogs they used in their breeding program was a red dog named Rags, who belonged to Frank Jones" boss, Jack Cooke. Rags had been given to Cooke by Jodrell Hopkins, and he turned out to be a very dominant sire, siring red puppies like himself. Around the same time, the son of a Norwich veterinarian, Lewis Low (nicknamed "Podge") acquired a smooth-coated, prick-ear white female who was reportedly a hunt terrier/Dandie Dinmont cross. Her owners brought her to Low"s father to be destroyed, but Low liked her coat, long legs, erect ears, and what seemed to him to be an "old" expression, so he kept her and named her Ninety. Ninety was bred to Rags, and several of the puppies were bought by Frank Jones. When Jones left his employment with Cooke, he took his terriers with him and continued to breed and sell the small red dogs. He also sent some of them to America, calling them Jones Terriers until in 1904, when he was asked the name of the breed and impulsively answered, "Norwich Terriers." Jones and his employer at the time supplied many of the early breeders of Norwich Terriers with their foundation stock, both in England and America. Over the next several years, many breeders worked to perfect the breed, sometimes trying crosses with different breeds. One of these breeders is R.J. Read, who became interested in the breed around 1908. He purchased a Rags daughter from Podge Low in 1909 and experimented with cross-breeding with other breeds, such as the Bedlington Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the Irish Terrier. By 1929, he had finally bred the dog that he was trying to produce. It was a small red terrier, no more than 10 pounds when mature, with a harsh red coat, dark eyes, short legs, and gamey personality. The dog"s name was Horstead Mick, and his name appears in many of today"s pedigrees. Mick was used a great deal as a stud and was the grandsire of one of the Norwich Terrier"s first champions, a drop-ear female named Tinker Bell. Another influential breeder is Phyllis Fagan, who acquired a red female named Brownie. Many of today"s Norwich and Norfolk Terriers are descended from her dogs. She showed her dogs and they did quite well in the show ring, as well as in earth trials. The breed was officially recognized in the 1930s in both the United States and Great Britain. Within the breed were dogs with prick ears and drop ears. Until this time, both prick-ear and drop-ear dogs were interbred because they were considered to be the same breed. When the breed was recognized by the English Kennel Club, however, the ears became an issue. Read liked the prick ear and wanted the breed standard to insist that all dogs of this breed have this type of ear. Proponents of the drop-ear dogs insisted that standard include both. In the end, the advocates of the dropped ear won and the standard was written to include both. For a few years, breeders continued to breed dogs with prick ears to those with drop ears, but then the ear carriage became erratic in both types and breeders decided on their own that this was not a good idea. After World War II, breeders stopped interbreeding the two different types of dogs. In September 1964, England"s Kennel Club allowed separation of the prick-eared and the drop-ear dogs, with prick-ear dogs remaining Norwich Terriers and the drop-ear named Norfolk Terriers. In 1979, the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were recognized as separate breeds by the American Kennel Club. Aside from the ears, the breed standards are very similar.
Males and females are 9 to 10 inches tall, and weigh 11 to 12 pounds
The Norfolk has personality plus. Though small, he makes up for it with a buoyant, lively approach to life. He is active, alert, good natured, and always ready to play. The Norfolk is tireless in his pursuit of fun--which can be exhausting for you. Don"t expect the Norfolk to sit around when there"s something to investigate. This dog thrives on action so be prepared to provide it for him--or he"ll be bored and unhappy. The Norfolk is a typical terrier, meaning he"s independent and always ready to give chase. He"s prone to dig and bark, too--behaviors that come naturally to breeds bred to chase vermin that live in dens. These traits can be frustrating to owners who are either unprepared for the terrier personality, or just don"t enjoy it. If you"re okay with terriers, you"ll be delighted with the Norfolk"s lively, plucky attitude, and his devotion to family.
The Norfolk is generally a hearty dog. Like all breeds, though, the Norfolk is prone to some conditions. Mitral valve disease (MVD). MVD is a life-threatening heart abnormality that reputable Norfolk breeders are working to reduce or completely eradicate in the breed. Research is underway, but it may take many years for it to be completed. Meanwhile, dogs with MVD should not be bred, and all breeding dogs should be tested for the condition. Canine hip dysplasia. Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Vaccination sensitivity. There are reports of Norfolks suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. Sometimes a dog who is sensitive to vaccines will develop complications, or die. Watch your Norfolk carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.
The Norfolk is an easy-care dog. Because of his small size, he"s well-suited to apartment living--though he can get barky if bored. He needs at least one 20 to 30 minute vigorous walk or play session, or two 10 to 15 minute sessions every day. This dog is intelligent and enjoys learning. But his natural independence and occasional stubborness can make training challenging at times. Consistent, positive training is the best way to convince him to do what you ask. Teaching the Norfolk to come reliably when called is especially important in case he accidentally comes unleashed. Don"t ever yell or use physical force with these dogs--they"re highly sensitive and may become fearful or agitated as a result. Like many terriers, the Norfolk barks. While he"s not overly noisy, a "Quiet" command should become part of his basic canine repertoire. One word of caution: the Norfolk, like many other earth dogs, enjoys, no, loves, digging and this trait is not as easy to deter as barking.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s been said that the Norfolk will eat anything that doesn"t eat him first. Not surprisingly, he"s prone to obesity. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Norfolk, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Norfolk Terrier has a double coat that consists of a soft, downy undercoat and a wiry top coat. The coat is weather-resistant, and sheds minimally. The Norfolk coat comes in shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle. The fur around the neck and shoulders is longer, and forms a ruff at the base of the ears and throat. The hair on the ears and head is short and smooth, except for eyebrows and whiskers. The shaggy, unkempt look of the Norfolk is part of his appeal. He does require some grooming, though. His coat should be brushed one or twice a week, toenails trimmed regularly, and ears cleaned or checked weekly. Frequent tooth brushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste help prevent gum disease. Monthly bathing is needed. More than that may soften the coarse terrier coat. The Norfolk coat is not usually trimmed with clippers like other breeds, but shortened or shaped by stripping, a process by which coat is thinned and shortened with a stripping knife, a sharp, comb-like tool. Stripping is common practice for owners with show dogs, but not necessary for a family pet.
The Norfolk is good with children, and makes a good family pet. He is best suited to families with children age 10 and older because they"re less likely to accidentally step on or hurt him, due to his small size. Because the good-natured Norfolk is less apt to quarrel with other dogs than some terriers, he lives happily in a household with other dogs. He is not well suited, however, for a home with small animals. Unable to curb his natural instinct, he"ll chase hamsters, gerbils, birds, and any other animal he perceives as prey.

The Norwegian Buhund hails from Norway, where he was responsible for herding livestock and guarding the farm. He has a trait that"s rare among the Spitz breeds: a desire to please. Add in his intelligence and independence, and you get a highly trainable and capable dog. He can handle jobs ranging from hearing dog, to police dog, to competitor in agility and obedience trials. His alert nature and tendency to bark make him a good watchdog, although he"s probably too friendly to pose any real threat.This is an active — some say tireless — breed who needs a lot of vigorous exercise and playtime daily. He"s highly affectionate with his family, including the kids, and enjoys a cuddle on the couch as well as a romp in the park. Kind, consistent training is essential for this smart dog, as is family involvement. He won"t want to be left out of anything!

The Norwegian Elkhound was originally used to hunt moose and other big game. The name of this ancient breed is a complete misnomer; they weren"t meant to hunt elk, and they aren"t hounds. In Norwegian, Norsk Elghund means "moose dog," and in German, elch means "moose" — probably part of the reason for the confusion in English. Linguistic history aside, the Elkhound has phenomenal stamina. While hunting, he would jump forward and back and around the moose, bear, or wolf, keeping it in one place and barking nonstop until the hunter arrived. While most people who live with a Norwegian Elkhound today don"t hunt outside the refrigerator, think about his fearless and active noisemaking strategy before you choose to bring an Elkhound into your life. Norwegian Elkhounds are known for barking, and although the trait can be trained out of some, you can"t bet on it. What this background means to the average dog owner is that exacting obedience work just isn"t in the picture. He"ll be fine in basic obedience and he makes a great family dog, but understand clearly that pleasing you is not the highest item on his to-do list. This is no Golden Retriever, so go get your own slippers. Toys are generally of no interest. He loves chasing balls, but you can forget about him bringing them back to you. That"s what happens when you share your heart and home with an independent thinker. He"ll want something in return for obedience work — which he sees as pointless — and you can forget a pat on the head as his reward. If you want to motivate your Elkhound in training and form a partnership, you"d better have a steady supply of treats on hand. Once an Elkhound bonds to you, though, you"ll be an inseparable pair as far as he"s concerned. Norwegian Elkhounds are strong-willed enough that they can take over a home if they"re allowed half a chance. They love the dominant role, and without proper training and socialization, this can become a problem. Training can be difficult, and they need a firm and consistent owner. Naturally, they prefer a winter climate with lots of snow to play in. A true adventurer, the Elkhound wants his adventure to occur outdoors. Long daily exercise is a necessity, so if you"re not ready to turn your couch potato ways into those of an outdoorsman, think twice — if you can"t keep up, you"ll soon be met with a house full of destroyed belongings that met their fates as he found ways to expend his endless energy. Not surprisingly, the Elkhound excels at fast-moving performance events such as agility. Once he"s outside, the Elkhound may see game he just has to track, and he"ll likely choose to ignore your calls for his return. Thanks to their strong prey drive, Elkhounds may even chase their quarry through plate-glass windows; and while they were bred to track but not attack game, they have been known to kill game on their own. That said, Norwegian Elkhounds are affectionate dogs who make devoted, wonderful family members. They"re excellent with children and are terrific watch dogs, treating strangers with natural suspicion. They thrive on attention, and it"s hard to find a more loyal companion.
The Norwegian Elkhound is loyal and affectionate, and he does very well with children and is generally friendly with strangers. However, he can be aggressive to other dogs and animals, so it"s important to properly socialize your Elkhound from puppyhood to a variety of new experiences and dogs. The Elkhound can be dominant and difficult to train, but training can nonetheless be enjoyable and effective as long as the approach is consistent and firm. Being a working breed, the Elkhound has a level of intelligence, independence, and energy that can be overwhelming for timid or inconsistent owners. You should expect him to need at least 30 minutes of exercise twice per day, which will also fight this food-motivated dog"s tendency toward obesity. He"ll also need some form of mental stimulation to keep him from becoming bored. The Norwegian Elkhound does fine in apartments if he"s properly exercised, but the ideal setting is a large, fenced yard. Despite his outdoor hardiness, he needs to live indoors with his family. He can be a barker, which you should keep in mind before bringing one home. Although some Elkhounds can be trained to not bark, this is not the norm. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Norwegian Elkhound originated in the breathtakingly beautiful and rugged country of Norway. He can be traced back roughly a thousand years, where a breed of dog similar in shape and size was used by the Vikings to guard and hunt. It"s possible that the breed may reach back as far as 5000 BCE, since alongside other artifacts from a primitive culture, archaeologists have found skeletons of dogs greatly resembling the shape of the Norwegian Elkhound. Although its exact history is lost in time, there"s little doubt that this breed is closely intertwined with the history of mankind. The Norwegian Elkhound has been a common fixture in the history of not only the Vikings but of Norwegian culture in general. The breed has been used to guard herds, flocks, and homes; and to hunt large game such as bear and moose. His role in hunting was to first track down his prey and then to hold it at bay by barking until the hunter could arrive to kill the animal. The Norwegian Elkhound became a breed of interest after the Norwegian Hunters Association held its first dog show in 1877. Shortly thereafter, breeders began an effort to create a breed standard and records, and to also shape the Norwegian Elkhound into a serious competitor in the conformation ring. Today, the Norwegian Elkhound makes a wonderful family companion and does well in a variety of dog sports and careers, including conformation, agility, obedience, flyball, freestyle, tracking, guarding, herding, sledding, and search and rescue. Norwegian Elkhounds are still used in their original capacity as hunting dogs as well.
The Norwegian Elkhound is a medium-sized dog, averaging 20.5 inches in height. Males average 55 pounds; females 48 pounds.
Independent thinkers, these extroverted clowns like to be where the action is. They see themselves as coexisting with you — not necessarily underneath you in the chain of command. They can be hard to train because of that independence, but they can get it if you"re firm and consistent. If you"re not a firm person, however, this dog will walk all over you. And while consistency is critical, harsh training methods don"t work well. Amazingly devoted, he"s protective if not outright possessive of his family. Attached and loyal, he"s happiest to be with you all the time and dotes on your attention and interaction. A born watchdog but not aggressive by nature, his bark provides a level of safety from intruders. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Elkhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Elkhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Elkhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Elkhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Elkhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Fanconi Syndrome: This is a serious, inherited disease that affects the kidneys and the tubules that reabsorb substances. This leads to improper levels of calcium, glucose, phosphate, sodium and amino acids. Symptoms, which usually begin with excessive urination and thirst, can occur between the ages of one to seven years. As the disease progresses and the kidneys begin to fail, symptoms include weight loss, muscle wasting, muscle pain, lethargy, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Untreated, the disease is fatal. If caught early and treated with appropriate management, affected dogs can do well. Management includes medication, change in diet, and a constant supply of fresh water. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Sebaceous Cysts: These are follicular cysts that form under the dog"s skin. They can range in size from small to as large as a walnut, and they will occasionally burst open, expelling a thick, white cheesy mass. Surgical removal is the usual treatment.
The Norwegian Elkhound requires daily exercise (breeders recommend 30 minutes twice a day), not only to burn off energy but also to help him maintain a healthy weight. Exceptionally food-motivated, he can become obese (look out for those huge, soulful brown eyes aimed at your dinner), and proper feeding and exercise are required throughout his life. He does all right in apartments, but he is a barker, so take that into consideration. A home with a fenced yard is more suitable. He could live outside because he"s so hardy, but he"d much rather be indoors with you. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Elkhound doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Elkhound accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Elkhound in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night (if that"s where he sleeps — he"s going to prefer to be in your bed with you). Elkhounds are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Remember that Elkhounds are highly motivated by food and can turn into accomplished beggars. So if you can"t resist sneaking him scraps from the table, and if you can"t provide the high level of exercise he requires, you could find yourself with an obese dog. Keep your Elkhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Elkhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A Northern breed, the Elkhound has a double coat that sheds dirt and is weather-resistant. The topcoat is short and thick and lies smooth. The undercoat is dense, woolly and soft to the touch. The Elkhound is usually medium gray with black-tipped guard hairs accented by a lot of light silver. Typically there"s a darker gray coloring on the saddle, and black tipping on the ears and tail. His chest and mane are a lighter gray. The Elkhound is shown in conformation in a natural state, without any trimming. Most of the year he doesn"t shed too much, but two or three times a year he "blows coat" and sheds like crazy. He requires weekly brushing, possibly more when shedding; but his coat is fairly easy to maintain. If you like a fastidiously clean house, however, another breed would be a better choice. The Norwegian Elkhound tends to be a clean breed in terms of his coat, which naturally expels debris (usually onto your couch or clothing). He generally doesn"t smell too doggish and requires baths only when absolutely necessary. When you do bathe him, it"s important to use a high-quality dog shampoo. Brush your Elkhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Elkhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
An Elkhound is excellent with children and will play with and protect them. However, without careful obedience training, they may take over the role of pack leader and become dominant, especially toward children, less strong-willed adults, or other dogs. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Norwegian Elkhound generally gets along with other pets, including cats, but remember his prey drive and willingness to hunt big game.

Also known as the puffin dog, this unique and acrobatic canine was discovered on a remote island in Norway, where he was used to scale cliffs and rob puffin nests of their eggs. With six toes on each foot, including two large, functional dewclaws, and an exceptional range of motion in his joints, he can climb just about anywhere in your house or yard and squirm through the narrowest of passageways. Heck, you might even see one trying his paw at Half Dome someday. Cheerful, inquisitive, and mischievous, this is a dog who needs close supervision to keep him out of trouble. He"s a primitive breed who"s difficult to housetrain and loves to bark and dig, so keep that in mind before deciding that it would be really cool to have a dog who can bend his head backwards, splay his front legs out to the side, and close his ears to keep out moisture and dirt. Provide him with plenty of early socialization to prevent shyness and noise sensitivity. And if you"re a bird lover, well, just keep in mind this breed"s original purpose.

The Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest of all the terriers, but what he lacks in size, he makes up for in personality and drive. This active terrier is a wonderful companion for an active individual or family. His name gives you a clue to his appearance and helps you tell him apart from his sibling, the Norfolk Terrier: remember that the Norwich has prick ears that stand up like a witch"s hat. The Norwich Terrier was once used for hunting both vermin and foxes, and today he can still be seen hunting in a variety of places. Norwich Terriers are a working breed and are happiest when they have a job to do such as attending obedience class and practicing at home or participating in various dog sports. The Norwich successfully competes in obedience and agility trials, rally, and earthdog trials. You can see the drive of the Norwich Terrier in his day-to-day life: chasing squirrels and other rodents, bolting out doors and gates if unrestrained, and digging and barking for entertainment. These terrier habits can make him unsuited for the person or family who can"t ensure these behaviors don"t become a nuisance. On the plus side, he"s loyal and alert, qualities that make him an excellent watchdog. Norwich Terriers are courageous, but they should never be aggressive. The breed is known for its loving and well-balanced nature and thrives on the companionship of the humans it loves. If you can cope with his high prey drive and tendencies to bark and dig, the Norwich Terrier is a wonderful companion and friend who may surprise you with his versatility and athleticism.
Norwich Terriers have a high prey drive and should never be trusted off leash when they"re not in a fenced area. Norwich Terriers require at least two long walks per day to keep them fit and to help them expel excess energy. They make excellent walking companions. Norwich Terriers must have a fenced yard because they will chase any animal they deem as "prey." Underground electronic fencing is not adequate for Norwich Terriers because they tend to ignore the shock. Norwich Terriers can be difficult to housetrain and although they"re eager to please, training can be difficult when not properly motivated. Be patient, stick to a regular schedule, reward them with praise and treats when they potty outdoors, and crate them when you can"t supervise them indoors. Norwich Terriers can coexist with other dogs and cats, but the breed will generally classify any rabbits, gerbils, or other small rodents as prey. They are not a good match for homes where small pets are allowed to roam free. Barking is often an indicator that your Norwich Terrier sees something suspicious, is bored, or hasn"t had his exercise needs met. The breed is not known for being overly yappy but there are exceptions to every rule and every Norwich Terrier will bark if the above occurs. Norwich Terriers can live in apartments if they"re given plenty of exercise (of course this can be said of most dogs). The Norwich Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging. Bear in mind it"s easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area then it is to break him of his digging habit. The Norwich is a rare and therefore expensive breed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Norwich Terrier is one of the younger breeds in existence today and shares his history with the Norfolk Terrier. In fact, the Norfolk Terrier was considered the drop-ear variety of the Norwich Terrier until 1964 when the British Kennel Club separated the prick ear and the drop ear into two different breeds. Before that time, however, the Norwich Terrier was a breed that rarely had a standard--a written description of the breed--that puppies were bred to. The breed originated in England, and several breeds may have contributed to its development, including the Irish Terrier. Between 1899 and 1902, a brindle-colored mixed-breed female was bred to a "Cantab Terrier." The resulting puppies were called Trumpington terriers, and one of them, "Rags," became the founding sire of the Norwich Terrier breed, being bred with various Trumpington terriers and Glen of Imaal terriers. For a time, they were known as Jones terriers, after Frank Jones, who was instrumental in developing them. The Norwich Terrier moved with Frank Jones to the United States and found use as not only a hunter of vermin but also as a terrier who could work alongside Foxhounds. The Norwich Terrier was used to flush foxes Foxhounds couldn"t get to because they"d gone into their dens. It didn"t take long for the Norwich Terrier to become known in the United States and many were imported into the US and used by American hunters for foxhunting. In 1979, the AKC followed the lead already set by England"s Kennel Club in 1964 and split the varieties into two different breeds: the drop-eared dog became the Norfolk Terrier and the prick-eared dog remained the Norwich Terrier.
Standing 10 inches high at the shoulders and weighing roughly 12 pounds for both males and females, the Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest of the terrier breeds. He should look stocky but not overweight.
The Norwich Terrier is known for his affectionate nature. He generally loves everyone and will do well in households with multiple pets and children. His sensitive intelligence and alert nature ensure that he"ll bark an alarm if he spots anything or anyone suspicious near his home. Norwich Terriers have a mind of their own, but they generally enjoy life and enjoy pleasing both themselves and their owners. They are small, but that doesn"t mean you should overindulge or coddle them. That simply leads to behavior problems. The Norwich is active and loves playing with balls and toys or just playing a good game with the people he loves. He thrives on the companionship of humans and will fit himself into your life completely. Like every dog, Norwich Terriers need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Norwich Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Norwich Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Norwich Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Tracheal Collapse: Tracheal collapse is often seen in small breed such as the Norwich. It is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings, which flatten until finally obstructing the airway. Signs of tracheal collapse include coughing that sounds like a goose honk, fainting, and an inability to exercise for long periods. It is treated medically with antibiotics, steroids, and cough suppressants. You may be advised to walk your dog with a harness rather than a collar to reduce pressure on his neck. If medical treatment doesn"t work, surgery is recommended. Elongated Soft Palate: The soft palate is the extension of the roof of the mouth. When the soft palate is elongated, it can obstruct the airway and cause difficulty in breathing. The treatment for Elongated Soft Palate is surgical removal of the excess palate. Epilepsy: The Norwich Terrier can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated by medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Norwich Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Norwich Terrier is an intelligent working dog. He"s happiest when he has a job to do. Training can be fairly easy with this breed as long you provide clear and consistent rules and training. Making a training session interesting rather than repetitive is another way to keep the Norwich Terrier engaged and interested in learning. Housetraining can be a challenge and may take a significant amount of time and patience. Use a crate to prevent accidents in the home. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Norwich doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Never stick your Norwich in a crate all day long, however. Norwich Terriers are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Norwich Terriers require daily exercise and like many terrier breeds they have an ample supply of energy. They make wonderful walking companions, and their exercise requirements can be met with a couple of vigorous 10- or 15-minute walks per day or playtime in a fenced area. It"s important that a Norwich Terrier remain on lead when he"s not in a fenced area or his strong desire to chase can cause him to run right in front of a car. Although the Norwich Terrier is known to bark, he can live in an apartment if his stimulation and exercise needs are met.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s been said that the Norwich will eat anything that doesn"t eat him first. Not surprisingly, he"s prone to obesity. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Norwich, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Norwich Terrier wears a hard, wiry, straight topcoat over a soft, downy, insulating undercoat. The hair on his neck and shoulders forms a protective mane. Small dark eyes twinkle beneath slight eyebrows. The hair on the rest of his head, including the ears and muzzle, is short. The Norwich coat can be any shade of red, grizzle (a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs), wheaten (pale yellow or fawn), or black and tan. Like all breeds, Norwich Terriers shed, though not as much as some. Brush them weekly to remove dead hair. Regular brushing will keep your Norwich clean. He won"t need frequent baths unless he rolls in something stinky. Stripping the coat twice a year--pulling out the dead topcoat by hand or with the aid of a stripping tool--maintains the coat"s characteristic hard texture. Without stripping, your Norwich will look a little scruffy, and he"ll shed more than he would otherwise. If you clip your Norwich"s coat instead of stripping it, the color and texture changes, becoming lighter and softer and more prone to shedding. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Norwich"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Small breeds such as the Norwich are especially prone to severe gingivitis. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Norwich enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Norwich accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Norwich Terriers are known for their love of everyone, and this includes children. They do much better in homes with children if they are raised with them. An adult Norwich who"s unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Norwich Terriers also do very well with other dogs and tend to have no issues with other canine pets. They can adjust to living with cats but they need to be properly socialized to them to do so.
Norwich Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and fostering. Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club

Frolicking at the water"s edge, white-tipped tail flashing in the sunlight, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever dances in the waves. Curious ducks and other waterfowl draw closer to watch his performance, when a hunter takes aim and fires. That"s when this remarkable dog shows he"s not simply a harmless goofball but a hardworking gun dog. He splashes into the water to retrieve the bounty he helped attract.The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a rare breed that originated in the Little River district of Nova Scotia, a province on Canada"s Atlantic coast. Originally known as Little River Duck Dogs, they were renamed the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever — a mouthful, even for a retriever, so most fans call them Tollers.This sporting breed has a lot going for it: personality, versatility, and an easy-care coat. They"re the smallest of all the retriever breeds and share many of the same traits, such as a strong working drive, intelligence, and a happy nature. But the breed has some drawbacks as well. They can be strong willed and are not as eager to please as a Labrador or Golden Retriever. If allowed to, they will take control of a household.They need to be guided by people who are firm, fair, and consistent. Even then they can be inventive in getting their way. With training, however, that intelligence and inventiveness can be channeled into almost any activity.They"re best suited to life with a weekend hunter or an active family who enjoys hiking or participating in dog sports, such as agility, flyball, and Frisbee.Tollers love kids. They"re great for playing ball or pulling a child on a skateboard. They get along well with other dogs, especially other Tollers. Their prey drive, however, may send them careening after cats or other animals that look like good sport.You"ll need a fenced yard if you have a Toller or be able to give him at least two good walks a day. That said, his activity level is moderate, and he doesn"t have the drive and intensity of, say, a Lab or a Border Collie.One hitch to living with a Toller in the city is the breed"s loud, high-pitched scream, which can make him unacceptable in apartments and neighborhoods with noise restrictions. The Toller yelps out when he"s stimulated, excited, or frustrated. Often, the sight of birds or squirrels elicits the scream. Other than that, however, they don"t tend to bark excessively.So he screams, sheds, likes to roll in dead fish and other stinky things, and is generally smarter than the average person. If these things concern you, look for another breed.On the other hand, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is an ideal dog if you are looking for a fun-loving, hard-working dog who enjoys long periods of exercise, and being with family. What is tolling?You can"t mention the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever without wondering what exactly "tolling" means. The word toller comes from the Middle English word tollen, meaning "to entice." Tolling is the act of luring game and it"s exactly what the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever does.While the hunter remains behind a blind, out of sight of ducks and other waterfowl, the dog plays at the water"s edge, romping and retrieving. These antics draw the attention of the birds, who swim closer to shore. When the birds are close enough, the Toller retreats to the blind, the hunter stands, scaring the birds into flight, and then fires. The Toller then swims out and retrieves any fallen birds.
Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are generally healthy, but because of the limited gene pool, some diseases have begun to occur. His red coat and flesh-colored nose mean the Toller may have a higher incidence of immune-mediated disease. Although he has a medium length coat, the Toller"s coat is fairly low maintenance and easy to care for. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are moderately active sporting dogs and need roughly an hour a day of exercise. If not properly exercised, they will expend their energy in less positive ways, such as chewing and digging. Tollers have a strong prey drive that will prompt them to chase cats or other small animals they see outdoors. Keep your Toller in a fenced yard to prevent him from running after prey. If you live in an apartment, or noise controlled neighborhood, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever may not be the dog for you. When he"s excited, he"s likely to emit a scream that"s loud, high-pitched, and nerve wracking. If you prefer a clean and tidy dog, the Toller may not be the breed for you. He sheds seasonally and enjoys rolling and frolicking in mud and dirt. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is not a miniature Golden Retriever; their temperaments are quite different. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a rare breed and it may take time to locate a reputable breeder who has puppies available. Expect a wait of six months to a year or more for a puppy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The original Tollers were foxes. Canada"s Micmac Indians observed foxes performing tolling behavior on the shores of rivers and lakes, then snatching the ducks foolish enough to come too close. The Micmacs encouraged this behavior in their own dogs, who also learned to lure the inquisitive ducks.In the 19th century, hunters in England and Canada began to develop dogs who"d go into the water to bring back downed birds. These retrievers, as they were called, bore the names of the places where they were developed, such as Labrador and Chesapeake Bay.But the hunters in Yarmouth County in southwest Nova Scotia"s Little River district went one step further. They created a dog who would attract birds as well as retrieve them. Starting with the Micmac Indian dogs, they mixed a little of this and that, skillfully blending in various other retriever breeds, Cocker Spaniels, Irish Setters, and maybe even farm collies. The result became known as the Little River Duck Dog.For years, the Little River Duck Dog was known only in the area where he was developed. But in 1945 the Canadian Kennel Club gave the breed recognition, as well as a new name: Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.The breed first came to the United States in the 1960s, but didn"t garner much interest. By 1984, however, the breed had enough fans that the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club USA was formed. The American Kennel Club accepted the breed in the Miscellaneous Class in 2001 and into the Sporting Group in 2003.Today the Toller ranks 110th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males stand 18 to 21 inches tall at the shoulder with an ideal height of 19 inches. Females are 17 to 20 inches, with the ideal height being 18 inches. Weight is in proportion to height and generally ranges from 35 to 50 pounds.
Tollers are smart, independent, and curious. Their personality lies somewhere between that of a Golden Retriever and a terrier. It"s not unusual for them to have a sense of humor, and they generally have an outgoing, upbeat attitude.When not working or playing, they"re content to lie down and be quiet. Adults are typically gentle dogs, particularly with children.Tollers are adaptable, moving from one environment to another with ease, and tolerant of crate training and travel. They can be standoffish toward strangers, but they take their cues from their people. If you"re friendly toward someone, your Toller will be, too.Tollers watch everything that"s going on and will alert you if someone is approaching your home. They usually get along well with other animals, although aggression is occasionally a problem. That"s not typical for the breed, however.As with every dog, Tollers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Establish yourself as the benevolent leader, rather than the harsh dictator, and your Toller should take well to training.
Tollers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Tollers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Collie Eye Anomaly: Although Collie eye is usually seen in Collie breeds, it has been seen in the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever in the last several years. Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and is diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies. Deafness: A few lines of Tollers appear to be prone to deafness. It tends to develop late in life, between 7 and 8 years of age.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tollers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Toller does best living in a home with access to a securely fenced yard. He can, however, live happily in a city highrise as long as he gets a couple of daily walks. There are Tollers in the country and Tollers who live in apartments and are paper-trained to potty on the balcony.Toller puppies are born yipping and running around, or at least it seems that way. During their first year, they"re highly active, but eventually their activity level tapers to a more manageable level.Like any dog, Tollers can be destructive as puppies if not properly supervised. Crate training is recommended. Adults can be destructive as well if they don"t get the exercise they need.A tired Toller is a good Toller. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise per day. He"ll enjoy a couple of 30-minute walks or runs, a 30-minute walk and 30 minutes of playing fetch, a hike of an hour or two, or any other combination of exercise the two of you can do together. And this dog likes to swim.To keep his feet in good condition, walk your Toller on rough ground once in a while. This helps keep the foot pads tight so they don"t pick up a lot of debris that could damage the foot.To protect puppies as they grow, monitor their activity and don"t let them overdo things. A good rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every month of age, so limit a 6-month-old puppy to 30 minutes of play or other exercise throughout the day.When it comes to training, be firm but gentle with your Toller, as well as creative, patient, and flexible. You must be able to earn his trust and respect without using anger, intimidation, or physical force. With this breed, harshness begets stubbornness, and you don"t want to get into a battle of wills with a Toller. You"ll lose. Set firm rules, enforce them consistently, and don"t let your Toller get bored.Train him with a light touch, however. He doesn"t perform well under pressure. But when he"s motivated by praise, play, and food rewards, the Toller learns quickly and easily.He shouldn"t be difficult to housetrain, given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Toller in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Toller, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Toller has a medium-length, water-repellent double coat. The red or orange color gives him a foxlike appearance, even giving rise to the tale that he"s the result of a fox-retriever cross, a genetic impossibility.He may have white markings on his feet, chest, face, or tail tip. A white tail tip is especially desirable because it allows the hunter to keep the dog in sight from a distance. The tail itself should be full and bushy, never trimmed and sculpted. Nose, lips, and eye rims are black or flesh-colored, blending with the coat.This is a wash-and-go dog. Throughout most of the year, the coat requires only weekly brushing to keep the fur from matting and to remove dead hair. During the spring and fall shedding seasons, daily brushing may be necessary.Otherwise, simply keep the nails trimmed, clean and trim the foot pads, and pluck around the ears if they"re particularly hairy. Bathe as needed.At some point during puppyhood, usually at three to four months of age, your Toller"s ears may go wonky, folding back instead of framing the face. The ears may need to be taped to regain the correct position. Your Toller"s breeder can show you how.Brush your Toller"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin getting your Toller accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Tollers love kids and make good playmates for active older children who"ll play ball with them, teach them tricks, and otherwise keep them occupied. They may be too rambunctious for very young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tollers enjoy the company of other dogs and get along just fine with cats, especially if they"re raised with them.

The wonderfully shaggy Old English Sheepdog is a favorite in children"s television shows and movies, where he"s usually an affable, if sometimes bumbling, character. But, hair and Hollywood glitz aside, who is the OES?In reality, the OES — nicknamed "Bobtail" because of his docked tail (traditionally kept short to identify him as a drover) — is an easygoing, fun-loving, intelligent dog. He"s a member of the American Kennel Club Herding Group. He"s certainly a large dog at 60 to 100 pounds, but his profuse coat of blue-gray and white makes him appear even larger. Known for his wonderful temperament, he"s powerful, sturdy, and hardworking.Those who know and love him are familiar with his sense of humor. He can be playful and comical, although he is also the guardian and protector of his family.You can"t talk about the OES without talking about hair, a lot of hair. This coat needs more care than most. It"s long and prone to matting if not regularly brushed. Many owners clip the hair short — but if he is to be a show dog, the OES cannot be trimmed short.Expect three to four hours of grooming per week — perhaps more — plus monthly visits to a grooming salon. Not surprisingly, a common reason that OES owners surrender their dogs to rescue organizations is because of the time and cost of caring for the coat. Anyone considering this breed must think long and hard about grooming and related care.The OES is highly adaptable. To some people"s surprise, he does well in an apartment if he is exercised regularly. In spite of his working heritage, he is not a good candidate for a backyard dog. He wants to be, and should be, with his family, and he can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too long. He is trainable and responds well to a firm owner who is kind and consistent. He gets along well with other dogs and pets.With his shaggy coat, keen mind, and bobbed tail, the OES is a great addition to any family with the time and patience to care for him.
Training and proper socialization is essential for Old English Sheepdogs. They are large, bouncy and enthusiastic, but when they are young they can be especially rowdy. Patient, consistent training is must. Old English Sheepdogs are not for clean freaks. They tend to drool and are heavy shedders. Also, their heavy coats trap debris and dirt, which ends up on your furniture and floor. Originally bred for driving cattle and sheep, the OES is an active breed that requires a lot of exercise. The Old English Sheepdog coat is high maintenance. Keeping it clean and tangle-free is time-consuming and expensive. Separation anxiety is common in Old English Sheepdogs. They live for their families, and they can become destructive if they"re left alone too much. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
Without a doubt, the Old English Sheepdog has one of the canine world"s most unclear origins. There is evidence that the breed originated in the southwestern counties of England somewhere in the early 19th century, though it may owe its origins to the Scottish Bearded Collie or the Russian Owtchar, or some other dog altogether.At the time of the breed"s suspected origins, writings described a dog that was used to drive cattle and sheep to market. Owners docked their tails to prove that they were indeed drovers" dogs, and commonly nicknamed them "Bob" or "Bobtail."The OES became prominent in the late 1880s when he came to the United States, where he was first owned by a Pittsburgh industrialist named W. Wade. By the 1900s, the breed was owned, exhibited, and bred by just five wealthy U.S. families. This prompted one show superintendent to advise the judges at the 1904 Westminster Show in New York to "take plenty of time; the dogs in the ring are the property of some of our leading Americans."In 1904, Henry Arthur Tilley founded the Old English Sheepdog Club of America. Tilley and his brother, William Steeds Tilley, were pioneers in creating the OES breed standard. Many of the dogs that they bred can be found in the pedigrees of OES lines today.The American Kennel Club recognized the Old English Sheepdog in 1885. As late as the 1950s, the OES still maintained his status as a rich man"s dog. By the 1960s, however, the breed had moved from being a status symbol to a family pet. By the mid 1970s, 15,000 dogs were registered annually; but that number has declined as more people have realized the cost and effort needed to care for wonderful but time-consuming OES coat.
Males stand 22 inches tall and weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Females stand 21 inches tall and weigh 60 to 85 pounds.
The Old English Sheepdog is a playful, affectionate clown who delights in frolicking with his family and neighborhood children. In fact, adolescence in the OES often extends to about age three, and an adult OES will retain his playful demeanor well into his golden years.An intelligent breed, the OES is a quick learner, always looking for something interesting and fun to do. He"s capable of performing numerous tasks, including herding, agility, obedience, and search and rescue.This breed requires significant physical and mental exercise. He doesn"t enjoy being left alone for long periods of time and much prefers — in fact needs — to be in the company of his family.A properly bred OES is good-natured and kind, and this is what makes him an excellent children"s companion and a super family dog. He"s sometimes called a nanny, a term of endearment that arises from stories surrounding the role he sometimes takes on within his family.However, the OES is not known for being an assertive watchdog. He may bark when strangers come to his home — or he may not. Some OESs are highly protective, while others aren"t.
Old English Sheepdogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Old English Sheepdogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Canine hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, however, arthritis can develop. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland. A mild symptom of the disease may be infertility. More apparent signs are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, and irregular heat cycles. The fur becomes coarse and brittle and falls out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism is treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires lifelong treatment. Deafness is fairly common and can provide many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and the dog. If your dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for him properly.
Because of his working origins, the OES likes activity. Today"s Old English Sheepdogs are very capable participants in sheepherding and agility trials, both of which demand a healthy and physically fit dog. Figure on one to two hours of daily exercise as part of the OES routine.Of course, your dog"s needs will vary according to age. Pups have a lot of energy — so much so that they will use it to destroy your home if they aren"t kept busy with approved activities. On the other hand, older dogs may prefer to lie on the couch (taking up all of it) and need encouragement to exercise. It"s important to note that while the OES can readily adjust to less exercise, this isn"t particularly healthy for him.However, cut back on outdoor exercise when the weather is hot. The dense undercoat of the OES is extremely warm, and the dog can overheat quickly and easily.Obedience training is encouraged for all dogs, but especially for a large breed like the OES. The basic commands ("sit," "down," "come," and "stay") are important for everyday living with any dog, but add a wet and muddy OES coat in the mix, and you"ll realize that these commands are crucial. Luckily, the OES is very intelligent and learns quickly.The OES does not always take confinement well, so if you crate train your OES puppy, must make sure that you do not leave him in the crate too long. He should be out with you when you are home; the OES is sensitive to being shut off from the family he loves.During his first year, the OES grows from 1 pound to 60. When fully grown, he may weigh as much as 100 pounds. Due to this rapid growth, especially between the ages of four and seven months, they are susceptible to bone disorders. Take care to feed your OES puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast.Additionally, he shouldn"t run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement; normal play on grass is fine. Forced jumping or jogging on hard surfaces should be avoided until the dog is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed (puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps, are fine).
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Overfeeding an OES is especially easy to do because the fluffy coat readily hides extra pounds. It is extremely important that you check your dog"s weight regularly and take care not to overfeed him.For more on feeding your Old English Sheepdog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
If you want a dog with big hair, the Old English Sheepdog is the one for you. This breed has hair galore: a profuse, shaggy coat that is neither straight nor curly. The breed has a double coat, with a textured outer coat and soft undercoat. Colors include gray, grizzle, blue or blue merle, brown, and fawn, usually mixed with white markings.If you want a grooming challenge, try the OES. His coat is difficult to maintain; you will spend a minimum of three to four hours a week grooming him. If you"re new to the world of dogs, you"ll need help learning how to brush and comb your OES. The breeder can be helpful, and there are many quality grooming books and (better yet) videos on the market aimed at helping pet owners with this task.The OES is a heavy shedder and requires daily brushing to remove dead hair and keep the coat free of tangles.Some Old English Sheepdogs drool so much that the coat around their mouths turns yellow. If this happens, a regular washing, especially after meals, will help. Another method is to apply cornstarch to the beard. Once the cornstarch has completely dried, brush it out. This also works well when an OES has diarrhea.As with all breeds, it is important to begin grooming the OES puppy at an early age. Making grooming a positive and soothing experience will ensure easier handling, both for you and for professional groomers, as your OES puppy grows into adulthood.You"ll need to invest in a few tools to brush and comb your OES: a pin brush, coarse steel comb, and a slicker brush. Brushing should be a gentle process to avoid pulling and hurting the dog. It is important to always brush all the way to the skin, not just the top layer of coat, to remove any debris or hair that"s trapped in the undercoat. One tip for brushing is to spray the dog lightly with a detangler and/or conditioner before you brush.Mats are a real danger for the OES, and they can lead to skin problems. They"re extremely difficult to remove and, in severe cases of matting, the dog will need to be shaved.Besides brushing and combing out the coat, the OES needs bathing every six to eight weeks. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe the ears out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner. Regular toothbrushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste will help prevent dental disease.Many owners opt to have a professional groomer keep the OES coat in good condition (in addition to the regular brushing they perform themselves). This is expensive, and you must consider the cost when you think about buying an OES.
The well-bred and well-socialized Old English Sheepdog is a trustworthy children"s companion. Some say he will supervise and herd young children, keeping them in a particular area. Others say the OES acts as a means of support to the toddler learning to walk.Unfortunately, there are some exceptions to the Old English Sheepdog"s role as a loving nanny, due to poor breeding that has resulted in ill-tempered and neurotic dogs. Buy only from a reputable breeder and ask to meet the puppy"s parents. And it is extremely important to note that children should never be left unsupervised with any dog, regardless of breed or temperament.The good-natured OES is friendly with other dogs and pets, provided he is properly socialized and trained.

Do you think life with a large, boisterous, shaggy dog would be perfect? If so, the Otterhound might be the dog for you. The Otterhound is an old breed, developed in England from Bloodhounds and other types of dogs. Although the Otterhound is believed to have been in existence for more than 500 years, it"s a fairly rare breed today. There are currently fewer than 1,000 Otterhounds, only 350 to 500 of them residing in the United States. In fact, just four to seven litters are born each year in the United States and Canada. If you have your heart set on an Otterhound, expect difficulty finding one. Why is the breed so uncommon? No one knows for sure, but it certainly isn"t because of the Otterhound personality. Sometimes called the "class clown," the Otterhound has a sweet, affectionate, fun-loving personality. He"s independent, too, not demanding a lot of attention. After greeting you with enthusiasm, the Otterhound is likely to finish the nap he was taking when you arrived. The Otterhound is a large breed. Even small females weigh about 65 pounds, and large males can weigh 125 pounds. They"re definitely dogs who take up space in the household. Otterhounds are great with kids, but because of their large size and bouncy personality, they may be too rowdy for very young or small children. They can also be too boisterous for frail seniors. The Otterhound has a distinctively shaggy look. His head appears to be very large and long; and his ears are long and folded, giving them a draped appearance. He"s physically strong, with a long, striding gait. He has the extremely sensitive nose of a hound, and it"s likely to lead him off to investigate his surroundings. Because the Otterhound was bred to hunt on land and in water, he has a rough, double coat and large, webbed feet. He comes in many different colors, the most common being a variation of black and tan grizzle, which often gets lighter as the dog gets older. The Otterhound has the distinctive and almost musical bark of the hound. This deep, loud, extended bay is music to a hunter"s ears, but it might not play as well with the neighbors. Although some Otterhounds are quiet, most seem to like the sound of their own voices, so it"s wise to teach your Otterhound a "quiet" command. Speaking of voices, the Otterhound also has wide range of vocalizations, from grunts to groans. Some even like to "sing" and vocalize with other dogs or with people. Otterhounds are usually good with other dogs and animals if they are raised with them or introduced carefully. The Otterhound benefits from a lot of socialization, especially as a pup, and it"s good for him to be included in all aspects of your life. Otterhounds tend to be opinionated, so training requires patience, especially since they become especially playful when they don"t want to comply with whatever you"re asking them to do. And because of their large size, training is absolutely necessary. Despite size and strength, however, the Otterhound has a "soft" personality; he doesn"t respond to harsh training methods. It"s best to be even more stubborn than he is, while keeping the training sessions short, fun, and positive for both of you. The Otterhound enjoys food, so this can be a great motivator in training. Be aware that his love of food can lead him astray: there are stories of Otterhounds who have learned to escape from any confinement to get into the kitchen, where they open cabinets, drawers, and even the refrigerator in order to steal a tasty tidbit. The Otterhound needs exercise, and a lot of it. He has a great deal of stamina and energy; jogging for three or four miles is like a walk in the park to him. If left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, especially without enough exercise, the Otterhound will find ways to entertain himself--ways that are apt to displease you, such as nonstop baying or excavating your newly planted flower garden. The hardworking Otterhound can be trained to compete in obedience and agility. He excels in tracking, and the percentage of Otterhounds who earn American Kennel Club tracking titles is usually higher each year than for any other breed. Despite his size, strength, and impressive bark, the Otterhound isn"t really suited to guard duty — he"s far too friendly to take the job of a watchdog seriously.
Otterhounds require a great deal of exercise, and not just chasing a ball in the backyard. A vigorous daily workout of jogging or swimming for several miles is needed to keep him physically and mentally healthy. However, because of the adverse effect of strenuous exercise on growing joints and bones, you should limit exercise among puppies and adolescent Otterhounds (and among those with hip dysplasia). Swimming is the best exercise for younger dogs, because the risk of joint injury is minimal. Otterhounds are enthusiastic and loud barkers. But don"t expect yours to be a guard dog — he"s far too friendly for that. Don"t allow your Otterhound off-leash in unfenced areas; you never know when he might catch an enticing scent and run off. Otterhounds enjoy being outdoors, but they"re best suited to living daily life inside the house with their families. A fenced yard is mandatory. Otterhounds have been known to jump fences as high as five feet, so be sure the fencing is at least six feet tall. The Otterhound is affectionate, but he"s also independent. He won"t follow you around, begging for attention. He"ll probably greet you when you get home, and then — if he doesn"t need exercise — he"ll return to his favorite snoozing spot. The Otterhound loves food and can become obese if you don"t monitor his diet. Also, his incredible sense of smell enables him to locate those special goodies you"ve hidden in the cabinets, and his size and cleverness enable him to find a way to get at them. Big dog, bigger expense. Everything for a big dog costs more, from food to grooming to veterinary care. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
While it"s fairly certain that Otterhounds descended from Bloodhounds, some think that they might also be related to French Griffons because of the distinctive fold of their ears. The breed was developed in England to hunt and destroy otters, which were decimating the fish in English rivers. Otter hunting, largely enjoyed by the nobility, was the first organized sport in England that used packs of scent hounds. It was first mentioned in the 12th century, during the reign of Henry II. The Otterhound, however, was not mentioned as a specific breed for another 200 years. The Otterhound was used, along with small terriers, to hunt otters along the banks of ponds and rivers. Terriers flushed the otter from its den; when the otter ran to the water, the Otterhound took over. The Otterhound"s nose is so sensitive that he can follow not only the "wash" (the scent of the otter in the water), but also the "drag," the trail of the otter on land. The dogs have been known to stay on 12-hour-old trails and to swim and wade as far as 20 miles in a day. With his rough, weather-resistant outer coat; slightly oily undercoat; big, webbed feet; and size, strength, and determination, the Otterhound did his job so well that eventually otters were declared a protected species in England. Otter hunting became illegal in 1982 (although some people then used their Otterhounds to hunt mink). Along the way, however, the Otterhound picked up many notable admirers. In fact, it"s said that the Otterhound was fancied by more kings (and one queen) than any other breed. Included among the Otterhounds" royal fanciers were Edward II, Henry VI, Richard III, Henry VIII, King John, Charles II, Edward IV, Henry II, Henry VII, and Elizabeth I. Otter hunting reached its peak popularity in the years immediately before World War I. At that time there were more than 500 hounds, in 24 packs, that hunted otter in England. Most of these dogs weren"t purebred Otterhounds, however, because hunters continued to crossbreed to improve the prowess of their dogs. Otterhounds appear to have been brought to the United States in 1900. They were first entered in a conformation show in 1907 in Claremont, Oklahoma. The Otterhound Club of America was founded in 1960, and the first National Specialty took place in 1981. The Otterhound was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1991.
Males are approximately 27 inches tall and weigh about 115 pounds. Females are approximately 24 inches tall and weigh about 80 pounds.
The Otterhound is an amiable fellow, with plenty of affection for every member of the family. He loves children, though he can play a little rough (not purposely) due to his large size. He is devoted to his family, but not overly so. He"s likely to extend happy greetings when you come home at the end of the day, but don"t expect him to follow you from room to room. He"s too independent for that. The Otterhound"s characteristic independence makes training challenging. You have to convince him that he wants to do what you"re asking. This is entirely possible, as long as you are patient and skilled. The good-natured Otterhound is not a top candidate for a watchdog. He"ll sound a loud warning bark to intruders, but that"s about it. As with every dog, the Otterhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Otterhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Otterhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Otterhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Otterhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Otterhounds. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hip Dysplasia: In this inherited condition, the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Canine Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia (CIT): Also called immune mediated thrombocytopenia or ITP, this condition results from an immune system disorder in which there are not enough platelets. CIT is more common in female dogs than in males, and it runs primarily in a few Otterhound lines. Symptoms include abnormal bleeding under the skin or gums.
Because of his large size and high activity needs, the Otterhound is not recommended for apartment dwellers or families without yards. He"s perfect, however, for active families who can take him jogging or, better yet, swimming each day. If he has enough exercise, he"s relatively inactive when inside the house. In temperate and cool climates, the Otterhound can sleep outdoors if he has adequate shelter. However, since he loves to be near his family, in spite of his independent nature, he can become bored and start barking, digging, or trying to escape if left alone too much. Invisible electric fences are not adequate for containing the Otterhound. Training and socialization are essential for the Otterhound, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Otterhound pup with you wherever he"s allowed, be it the lumber yard, the pet supply store, outdoor events, or on long walks in busy parks. Anyplace where there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Otterhound. Just don"t let your Otterhound off his leash in such places, even if you think he"ll come reliably when called. His instinct is to follow his nose, and that, coupled with his independent nature, means he"s likely to give take off after any interesting scent.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Do not overfeed the Otterhound, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Limit treats and encourage activity. Keep food safely locked away, too, to prevent thievery! Keep your Otterhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Otterhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
You might say the messy look is "in" with the Otterhound. This characteristically scruffy-looking breed has a double coat. The outer coat is two to six inches long, rough and very thick. The undercoat is woolly and slightly oily. With this combination, the Otterhound is relatively weather-resistant, and he can bound in and out of streams and lakes without the undercoat absorbing a great deal of water. The Otterhound"s coat color is any recognized hound color except liver and white, all white, or white with distinct black and tan patches. Black and tan grizzle is common. The shaggy Otterhound coat sheds and must be brushed at least once a week to avoid matting. Some Otterhounds have softer coats that require brushing at least two to three times a week to prevent mats. The Otterhound coat is best kept au naturel, so it is not clipped. If you decide to clip because the coat is matted, or because your dog has a skin condition, it takes about two years for the coat to grow back to its original length. You may need to wash his beard daily, because it tends to drag in his food or on the ground; and if you don"t keep the beard clean, it can develop an unpleasant odor. Brush your Otterhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Since they are long and hang down, they don"t allow the best air circulation, and ear infections can result. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Otterhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Otterhounds are boisterous, fun-loving dogs, but because of their size and tendency toward clumsiness, you should supervise them when they are with small children. They love children and wouldn"t hurt them intentionally, but their size and exuberance might cause them to knock a small child to the ground. The Otterhound is probably better suited to a family with older children, ages 10 and up. If properly trained and socialized, the Otterhound gets along well with other dogs. Use caution when introducing him to small pets, however. The Otterhound"s hunting instinct is strong, and he"s likely to chase animals he perceives as prey.

The Papillon, whose name comes from the French word for butterfly, is a portrait come to life, the modern representation of the small spaniels often seen in paintings from centuries past. The dwarf spaniel, as he was once known, has changed somewhat in appearance over the years, but he"s still the same wonderful companion who graced the laps of ladies and kings so many years ago. The word papillon, meaning "butterfly," refers to the breed"s fringed upright ears, which resemble a butterfly"s outspread wings. The breed also comes in a drop-eared variety called the phalene, which means "moth," a cousin of the butterfly that folds its wings at rest. Both varieties can be born in the same litter, although the Papillon is the more popular and recognized variety. While he might be categorized by size as a lap dog, the bright, busy, and curious Papillon is no shrinking butterfly. If you want a dog to sit on your lap while you watch television, he"s probably not the best choice. He"s more likely to be flitting around looking for something to do and will happily rid your home and yard of any small rodents that might be lurking there. And this small dog in a sturdy package takes seriously his duties as family companion and guardian. He has a big-dog attitude and a level of alertness that makes him a super watchdog, but when it comes to protecting you it"s important to make sure he doesn"t bite off more than he can chew. He has no idea that he weighs only 4 to 9 pounds. The Papillon is outgoing and energetic. He loves to be with people and is a happy dog who gives kisses freely to all. The Papillon"s small size makes him easy to handle, and his coat, while profuse, is easy to care for and doesn"t shed excessively. His energy level ranges from moderate to intense, and being highly trainable he"s a great choice if you want to participate in dog sports such as agility or rally. Papillons are also excellent competitors in the obedience ring and are the number-one toy breed in obedience competition. All Papillon owners should attend obedience class if only to ensure that they don"t spoil their charming companions. Papillons can develop a stubborn streak if not shown early that such behavior will not be tolerated. On the plus side, their will to please and desire to succeed make them good at learning tricks or anything else a creative person can teach them. Papillons can even learn to pull a tiny cart and will proudly pull it in parades. Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It"s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge. Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child"s hands and injure himself if he"s not being held correctly, and he won"t hesitate to defend himself if he"s being mistreated. No matter what the breed, dogs and children must always be supervised when they"re together. This is a long-lived breed. It"s common for Papillons to live well into their teens, and if you"re considering purchasing one you should take that into consideration. The dog will be a member of your family for years to come. A Papillon made breed history in 1999 when for the first time one took Best In Show at the Westminster Kennel Club show. The dog, Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being, or Kirby to his friends, also won the World Dog Show in Helsinki, Finland, and the Royal Invitational in Canada in 1998. This dog"s wins introduced the breed to many who had never seen or heard of the Papillon and has contributed to the breed"s rise in popularity. Nonetheless, you won"t find a Papillon on every street corner. He"s not a rare breed, but he"s not common, either. Most breeders have a waiting list because Papillons tend to have small litters. The Papillon has been bred for centuries to be the ultimate companion. They are extremely people oriented and demand to be included in their person"s life at all times. If you are looking for a lively, energetic, outgoing, and gregarious companion this could be the breed for you. You and your Papillon will live happily together for many years.
Some lines can be nervous, high-strung, and timid. This is not appropriate for the breed. Avoid puppies with these characteristics or puppies from parents with these characteristics. Papillons do not do well in environments where there is little time for the dog. They will choose to be never separated from their human companions. Puppies are fragile and can be injured by rough and tumble play. They are not suitable for families with very small children. Papillons are among the breeds sensitive to anesthesia. Keep this in mind when scheduling any surgical procedure. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Papillon was portrayed in portraits dating to the 16th century, a testament to the breed"s age and staying power. Rubens, Watteau, Boucher, Van Dyke, Rembrandt, and Fragonard all portrayed them in various artworks, usually accompanying their doting mistresses. The little spaniels were favorite companions of court ladies throughout Europe. Traders carried them in baskets on mules through France, Italy, and Spain. The early toy spaniels from which the Papillon descended had drop ears, but in the 17th century court of Louis XIV a small spaniel with upright ears was developed and given the name Papillon for its resemblance to a butterfly. Other names by which the breed has been known over the centuries include Epagneul Nain (dwarf spaniel), Dwarf Continental Spaniels, Little Squirrel Dogs (because their full, plumed tail resembled that of a squirrel) or Belgian Toy Spaniels. Besides the ears, the only other major change in the breed"s appearance was in color. Originally the little spaniels were solid-colored, but these days they"re white with patches of color. Otherwise, a Papillon today looks much the same as one you might see portrayed in a painting in the Louvre. The drop-eared variety, known as the Phalene, still exists although he"s not as commonly seen. The Papillon ranks 35th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
Papillons stand 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder and weigh 4 to 9 pounds.
The Papillon is happy, alert, and friendly. He should never be shy or aggressive. This is, however, a take-charge little dog with a moderate to intense activity level. He"s very smart and highly trainable and is best described as a doer, not a cuddler. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Papillons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Papillon pup grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Papillons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Papillons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Papillons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a possible problem with all toy breed puppies. Hypoglycemia is easily treatable in the early stages but can be fatal if not treated. It is important that breeders and owners of toy breed puppies recognize the signs and symptoms because this condition can often be misdiagnosed as viral hepatitis or encephalitis by veterinarians. A puppy with hypoglycemia will slow down and become listless, followed by trembling or shivering. Place some honey under his tongue and get him to the vet immediately. If the situation is allowed to continue, he"ll eventually collapse, go into convulsions, fall into a coma, and die. Any time your Papillon is limp, with grayish-blue gums and tongue, it"s an emergency. Hypoglycemia occurs in toy puppies because they do not have the fat reserves to supply adequate glucose in times of stress or when they do not eat regularly. Collapsed Trachea: It is not completely understood how this occurs, but the rapid inhalation of air causes the trachea to flatten and makes it difficult for air to enter the lungs, much like a soda straw being drawn on too vigorously. This condition may be inherited; it occurs in certain breeds, and dogs with it show an abnormality in the chemical makeup of their tracheal rings in which the rings lose their stiffness and become unable to retain their circular shape. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Open Fontanel: Papillons are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby"s will, but sometimes one will not close fully. An accidental blow to that spot on the head could kill a Papillon with an unclosed soft spot.
Papillons are housedogs and aren"t suited to living outdoors. They are active, however, and will enjoy having a yard where they can run in wild, fast circles. If that"s not available, however, they"ll make do with tearing through your house and jumping on and off the furniture. They are often described as mountain goats, so don"t be surprised if you find yours up on the kitchen table or some other high spot. Adults need two or three 20- to 30-minute walks or playtimes per day, and they"ll appreciate more if you can provide it. Start puppies with two or three 10- to 15-minute walks and gradually increase the time and distance. Puppy or adult, they"ll let you know if they"re getting tired by stopping or sitting. Although they grow up to be sturdy little dogs, Papillon puppies can be fragile. They can easily break a leg soaring off the back of the sofa or jumping off the bed, so try to avoid such situations by teaching them to use steps to get on and off furniture or waiting until you lift them down. Papillons are easy to housetrain if you keep them on a schedule. Always take them out when they first wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, after a grooming session or bath, and just before bedtime. When you can"t supervise them, they should be crated or placed in a puppy-proofed room. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Papillon doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Papillon accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Papillon in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Papillons are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Train your Papillon using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s easy to overfeed a Papillon, but he has delicate knees and shouldn"t be allowed to get fat. Keep your Papillon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Papillon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Papillon"s long, flowing coat is straight, fine, and silky, with no undercoat. Cascading down his chest is a frill of hair. His beautiful butterfly-like ears are fringed with hair, and the insides are covered with medium-length silken hair. Feathering covers the backs of the forelegs, and the hind legs are dressed in breeches, a fringe of longish hair on the thigh area, also known as culottes. Topping it all off is a long, flowing plume of a tail carried proudly arched over the body. The Papillon is always parti-colored, white with patches of any color. On the head, any color other than white covers both ears back and front and extends without interruption from the ears over both eyes. The ideal Papillon has a clearly defined white blaze and nose band, but one with a solidly marked head still makes a great companion. The nose, eye rims, and lips are black. The coat isn"t prone to matting but should be combed and brushed once or twice a week to distribute the natural skin oils and keep the hair and skin healthy. The Papillon doesn"t have a doggie odor, so bathe him only as needed. He"s a wash-and-go kind of dog. Trim nails two or three times a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Small dogs are prone to periodontal disease, so start dental hygiene early. Brushing your Papillon"s teeth two or three times a week — daily if possible — will help keep them clean and tartar-free.
Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child"s hands and injure himself if he"s not being held correctly, and he won"t hesitate to defend himself if he"s being mistreated. Many breeders won"t sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured. Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Papillon if they"re sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It"s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.

For a "designer dog," the Peekapoo dog breed has a fairly long history; with the help of responsible breeders, it"s possible that the history will get longer still. A cross between a Pekingese and a Poodle, he was among the first of the recent slew of Poodle crosses to be developed, back in the 1950s and "60s. He hasn"t gained as much recognition as some of the other designer dogs, such as the Labradoodle and the Cockapoo, but he"s won enough of a following that he"s thrived for the last five decades. One possible reason for his success is that some designer dog breeders are trying to create a formal breed, whereas the Peekapoo folks believe that the best Peekapoo is still a cross between a purebred Pekingese and a purebred Poodle, and they don"t breed Peekapoos to Peekapoos. The Peekapoo doesn"t have a club or any organization trying to nudge him into recognition as a breed. This keeps him fairly clear of inherent diseases, although some still occur because a dog"s health depends on how well the breeder has selected the parents. Like most designer dogs, the Peekapoo was developed to be a companion for people with allergies. As with all designer dogs, some can still have coats that produce an average amount of shed hair and dander, setting off a person"s allergies. But even though designer "Doodle" dogs aren"t a perfect fit for those with allergies, the intelligent and affectionate Peekapoo steals many hearts and has made his way into a lot of homes and laps. He"s also begun to see success as a therapy dog. He makes an excellent watchdog and will bark without fail whenever he sees something or someone he thinks is suspicious. If you live somewhere with noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you. He may be small, but he has a mighty loud bark. The Peekapoo is an outdoorsman. He fares best in a home with a fenced yard, although he can do well in an apartment. The Peekapoo should definitely live in a home with air-conditioning, because he can succumb quickly to heat exhaustion thanks to that flat-faced pedigree. He shouldn"t live outdoors or be left unsupervised outside. Proper exercise is a must; expect at least one walk and a good play session in the yard each day. He has a high energy level and if he doesn"t get his daily activity he can become destructive. A Peekapoo doesn"t extend his affections to strangers; he"s naturally suspicious of them, and they must earn his trust. A Peekapoo needs to be socialized to a variety of people and stimuli to be the well-rounded and affectionate dog that he can easily be. The Peekapoo generally gets along with everyone in his family. He does well with older, more considerate children, and he must be socialized and raised with children to be accepting of them. He behaves well with other dogs and pets, but again, he needs to be raised with them and properly socialized. Being a companion dog, the Peekapoo isn"t happy when left alone for long periods at a time. He can suffer from separation anxiety and become destructive when on his own.
The Peekapoo is a designer breed and is usually the result of Pekingese to Toy or Miniature Poodle breeding. Multigenerational breedings (Peekapoo to Peekapoo) are rare. If you"re interested in a Peekapoo puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren"t as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don"t know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog. The Peekapoo is an active and energetic dog. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard. Don"t overexercise a Peekapoo to the point of respiratory distress. Peekapoos can suffer from heat exhaustion quickly. They do best in a home that has air-conditioning. Barking is a favorite pastime for a Peekapoo. They make excellent watchdogs and will alert bark at people or things they think are suspicious. A clipped Peekapoo only requires about two brushings per week, while a Peekapoo with a full, natural coat will require daily brushing. Loving and gentle, the Peekapoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children. Peekapoos generally do well with other dogs and pets if they"re introduced to them at a young age. Peekapoos can be easy to train with positive reinforcement. With his small stature, the Peekapoo can make an excellent apartment dweller, but he"s happiest with a yard in which to enjoy the great outdoors. Peekapoos may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Peekapoo is one of the oldest of the hybrid, or designer, breeds. He was developed in the 1950s with the cross of a Pekingese with a Miniature or Toy Poodle. The goal was to produce a non- to low-shedding dog suitable for people with allergies. The Peekapoo gained popularity by the early 1960s, around the same time as the Cockapoo. Despite the popularity of the Peekapoo, there is no breed club. The hybrid has remained largely a first-generation cross; the parents are usually Pekingese and Poodles. There is no indication that multigenerational breeding will occur — but never say never. Due to his small, lap-friendly size and sweetly affectionate temperament, the Peekapoo has maintained a strong following.
There is no breed standard, so there"s nothing for breeders to conform to. Therefore, the Peekapoo is seen in a range of sizes. He averages up to 11 inches in height, and he can range in weight from 4 to 20 pounds.
The Peekapoo is a loving and loyal dog who is dedicated to his family. An ideal lapdog, he delights in being part of every family activity. He is gentle and rarely combative. He is an intelligent dog who is happiest with his owner, especially out in the great outdoors. Protective of his family, he"ll defend them with everything in that small body. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Because he"s naturally suspicious of strangers and new dogs, early and ongoing socialization is a must for the Peekapoo. If not properly socialized, he can be slightly aggressive or timid. That"s true of any dog, but particularly so for those who tend toward being wary of strangers. Enrolling your young Peekapoo in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start down the road of socialization. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking him to busy parks and stores that allow dogs, and going on leisurely strolls to meet the neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you"re looking for a Peekapoo. Hybrid vigor isn"t necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it"s the opposite of inbreeding. However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won"t have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from a different line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they"re purebred. Peekapoos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Peekapoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Before you bring home your Peekapoo, find out if he"s from a first-generation or multigenerational breeding (although multigenerational breedings are rare in Peekapoos). If he"s a first-generation dog, research the health concerns that occur in both Pekinese and Toy or Miniature Poodles. Regardless of generation, all parents should have the applicable health clearances. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Peekapoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This affliction involves the hip joint, usually in small dogs. If your Peekapoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is another common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.
The Peekapoo is an active little dog who requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy. Unwanted energy can lead to destructive behavior, and it"s shocking — truly shocking — how much damage a small, bored dog can do. A Peekapoo enjoys being outside and likes to play in the yard and go for walks (all walks are considered nice walks). However, don"t overexercise a Peekapoo; brachycephalic dogs with flat faces, such as Pekingese, Pugs, and some Peekapoos, can easily overheat and develop respiratory troubles as a result. And remember that a high-energy small dog won"t require as much exercise as a high-energy large dog. The Peekapoo can be trained easily with the use of positive reinforcement. Harsh corrections should not be used with a Peekapoo, since they can literally hurt him. A Peekapoo can adapt to any type of dwelling, including apartments, but they do much better with a small fenced yard to access, since they enjoy being outdoors. They should not be left unattended outside, however, since they can become prey for larger dogs and animals in the neighborhood. A Peekapoo should also live in a home with air-conditioning, since they can be susceptible to heat exhaustion. A Peekapoo should never be exercised or left outside on unusually hot days. Peekapoos are noisy and will alert bark whenever they see something or someone suspicious. That"s not always a barrel of laughs, but at least they make great watchdogs. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Peekapoo doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Peekapoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Peekapoo in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Peekapoos aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Peekapoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Peekapoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Peekapoo"s coat is usually soft in texture and has an almost cottony feel. It should be wavy and of medium to long length. There is no undercoat. The desired coat is low-shedding, but a Peekapoo can range from low to average shedding, depending on the roll of the genetic dice. Coat colors run a tremendous range, from silver, gray, white, sable, red, cream, apricot, chocolate, to buff and black. The Peekapoo can also have a variety of markings, including phantom, which is black with tan markings. A Peekapoo"s fine coat requires regular grooming to stay healthy and free of tangles. He requires some care in keeping the Pekingese-based wrinkles and folds around the eyes, muzzle, ears, and nose free of dirt and debris. The Peekapoo can be clipped for easier care, but he still requires regular brushing and bathing. If his coat is kept long, then it will need to be brushed daily to avoid tangles and mats. Occasionally hair can cause some irritation to the eyes. If this happens, pluck the offending hair regularly. Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Peekapoo"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your short Peekapoo enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Peekapoo to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the nose, mouth, and eyes. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Peekapoo can make a loving companion to any child if properly introduced to children from a young age. The Peekapoo is naturally suspicious of new people, and a loud, rambunctious kid may be too much for an older Peekapoo to handle. And even though a socialized Peekapoo is gentle with youngsters, he"s not suited to homes with small children who may unintentionally hurt him — a Peekapoo can be injured easily. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Peekapoo also does well with other dogs and pets, but again, early socialization is the key to success. Otherwise the Peekapoo can be combative and aggressive toward new dogs and pets.

It"s no wonder the Pekingese has a self-important attitude, given his history as an imperial favorite. He was held in great esteem at the imperial court of China, and he still knows it today. A Pekingese will greet you with dignity and pride. He is well aware that his ancestors were the companions of royalty and he continues to demand the respect such a position entails today. With his soft round brown eyes, mane of long straight hair and tail carried jauntily over his back, he swaggers through life in full awareness of who he is and the importance he has to the people who live with him. Pekingese are very intelligent, but that intelligence is offset by an independent mind and a wide stubborn streak. Training them is a challenge. They consider themselves in charge of any situation so you must persuade them that you are in charge and that doing what you want is to their advantage. Pekingese do not respond well to harsh training or discipline and it can cause them to become defensive and possibly to bite. Pekingese are very loving and affectionate with their family but aloof, almost wary, of strangers. That characteristic makes them excellent watchdogs; they like to bark when strangers approach. Some Pekingese tend to bark too much, so it"s a good idea early on to teach them when to stop. They are brave, sometimes to the point of being foolhardy, and will defend you to the death if needed. While children are always intrigued by small dogs, a Pekingese is not a good choice for families with toddlers who may treat him roughly without meaning to. The Peke won"t tolerate being grabbed or poked and won"t hesitate to defend himself. Always supervise any interaction between a Pekingese and a child of any age. Pekes don"t always get along with other dogs. They prefer the company of other Pekingese, and it can take them a long time to get used to other animals in the household. With proper socialization — early exposure to many different people, other animals, sights, sounds, and experiences — however, they can become best friends with other dogs and cats and include them in their royal group. Until you"re sure everyone gets along, though, supervise any active play. The Peke"s round, protuberant eyes are easily injured with the swipe of a paw or claw. The profuse coat of the Pekingese needs daily to weekly care. The long, flowing coat of the show dog needs daily maintenance, but people who have companion Pekingese can choose to keep their pets" coats trimmed short to ease the burden of grooming. If you are looking for a devoted, loving friend who will treat you with respect and dignity and expect the same treatment from you, then the Pekingese may be a breed to consider. They need someone who understands their unique needs and who is willing to make room for a truly individual personality in their lives. The Pekingese will return your care with all the love and affection that a truly large heart in a small package can offer.
Due to their short noses, Pekes snore, some quite loudly. The round bulging eye of the Pekingese can be damaged or "popped out" during excessively rough play; this is rare but can occur. Pekes have an excessive amount of wrinkling on face; this can cause problems with skin fold dermatitis, skin irritations, and infections. The folds should be kept clean and dry. Pekes have a tendency to gain weight if overfed. A Peke may go on a hunger strike just to prove a point over his owner. Pekingese tend to bark a lot. The breed can be difficult to housebreak. Pekingese tend to be one-person dogs. Because of their profuse coat and short noses, they do not tolerate heat well. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
According to Chinese legend, a lion once fell in love with a marmoset, a type of monkey. To wed his love, the lion begged Buddha to reduce him in size but let him retain his great lion heart and character. Buddha consented, and from the union of the two descended the dogs of Fu Lin, the lion dogs of China. Perhaps that"s not quite how the Pekingese came into being, but it"s a good story. The breed is indeed ancient, with DNA evidence confirming it as one of the oldest of dog breeds. The Peke is believed to have existed in China for as long as 2,000 years. Named for the capital city of Peking (now Beijing), they were companions to nobles, princes, and members of the imperial family. Commoners bowed down to them, treatment they still expect today. The Pekingese was closely guarded and never allowed to leave the palace let alone the country, but he came to the attention of the Western world as a result of the Opium War in 1860. When British troops entered the imperial palace after invading Peking, one of their discoveries was five Pekingese dogs guarding the body of their mistress, who had committed suicide rather than face capture. The dogs became prizes of war and were taken to England where two were presented to the Duchess of Wellington, two to the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon, and one to Queen Victoria, who named it "Looty." They remained rare, although by the 1890s, more Pekingese were being smuggled out of China. A dog named Pekin Peter was reportedly the first Pekingese to be exhibited at a British dog show, in 1894. The breed at the time was known variously as a Chinese Pug and a Pekingese Spaniel. A Pekingese club was established in 1904. Naturally, the Peke"s popularity spread across the Atlantic to the United States. The first Pekingese registered by the American Kennel Club was Rascal, in 1906, and the Pekingese Club of America was formed in 1909. Today the breed ranks 49th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The Pekingese is heavy for his size with a stocky, muscular body. He is 6 to 9 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 7 to 14 pounds. In imperial China, Pekingese that weighed less than six pounds were called "sleeve dogs" and rode in the sleeve cuffs of the robes worn by members of the imperial court.
He may look foofy, but the Pekingese is a stand-up character who"s tougher and braver than his appearance suggests. The Peke"s regal dignity, self-importance, confidence, and stubborn streak all come together in a lively, affectionate, good-natured dog who"ll respect you if you respect him. He"s loyal to and protective of his people, barking in warning when strangers appear. Train him with firm, kind consistency, using positive reinforcements such as food rewards and praise. You will always succeed if you can persuade the Peke that doing something is his idea, not yours. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Pekingese need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Peke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pekingese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pekes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pekes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Brachycephalic Syndrome: The full name for the condition is brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS). This condition occurs in those breeds that have been selectively bred to have a shortened face. These dogs have some problem with breathing from the time they are born. The exaggerated features that occur with their anatomy include an elongated and fleshy soft palate, narrowed nostrils, changes to the larynx, and a relatively small trachea. Problems vary according to the severity of the disease. Most brachycephalic dogs snuffle and snort to some degree. Some have no other problems; others have increasingly noisy breathing, coughing, gagging, fainting, and collapsing episodes and a decreased tolerance for exercise. Overheating is especially dangerous for these breeds because panting causes more swelling and narrowing of the airway, increasing the dogs" anxiety. Treatment can include keeping dog from becoming overweight, corticosteroids for short term relief of airway inflammation, and surgical shortening of the soft palate if it is elongated. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Ectopic Cilia: An abnormality of eyelash growth in which extra eyelashes grow through the eyelid to the inside. One or more ectopic cilia may be present. Clinical signs of discomfort vary according to the number of abnormal cilia and whether they are fine or coarse. This type of eyelash abnormality is particularly irritating to the eye and more likely to cause corneal ulcers. Treatment consists of treating any corneal ulcers that have occurred with antibiotics and surgical removal of the aberrant follicle. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Pekingese has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if he doesn"t outgrow it by adulthood. Fold Dermatitis: A skin infection caused by folds in the skin in which rubbing occurs or moisture gets trapped. It is more commonly found in breeds that have folds in the skin such as Pekingese. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor, and the dog can be affected on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, and any other fold on the body. The treatment for fold dermatitis varies depending on the area affected, but it can include surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. It can also include topical antibiotic ointments. The best means of treatment is to properly maintain your dog"s coat to prevent the condition. Hydrocephalus: Occurs when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain accumulates because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of perinatal trauma, placing pressure on the brain. This usually occurs in young dogs under the age of 18 months and older dogs that are more than 6 years old. If hydrocephalus is left untreated, the dog will die. Treatment consists of medical treatment and surgery where either the obstruction is removed or a shunt is inserted. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye, is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform a Schirmer tear test to diagnose dry eye, which can be controlled with medication and special care. This eye condition requires life-long therapy and care. Mitral Valve Disease: This defect in the mitral valve of the heart causes a backup of blood into the left atrium, known as mitral regurgitation. This causes the heart to be less efficient at pumping the blood. It is the most common acquired cardiac disease, affecting more than one-third of dogs over ten years of age. There are several breeds that are genetically predisposed to acquire the condition at a much younger age, and the Pekingese is one of them. If your veterinarian hears a heart murmur, your Peke should be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome: This syndrome can be caused by a number of factors such as exophthalmos, which is a protrusion of the eyeball, macroblepharon, which is a large eyelid opening, and lagophthalmos, which is an inability to completely close the eyelid. These factors cause the cornea to be exposed, resulting in an inability to blink properly and the easy evaporation of tears. The syndrome can lead to corneal ulcers, and a pigmentation of the cornea that may cause vision impairment. Signs are generally red eyes, increased tears, and pawing at the eyes. Treatment for Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome is usually various surgeries, but tear substitutes have been used as a temporary treatment. Intervertebral Disk Disease: The spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column, and between the bones of the vertebral column are intervertebral discs that work as shock absorbers and allow normal movement of the vertebrae. The discs are made of two layers, an outer fibrous layer and an inner jelly-like layer. Intervertebral disc disease occurs when the jelly like inner layer protrudes into the spinal canal and pushes against the spinal cord. Compression of the spinal cord may be minimal, causing neck or back pain, or it can be severe, causing loss of sensation, paralysis, and lack of bowel or bladder control. The damage done by the spinal compression may be irreversible. Treatment is based on several factors, including location, severity, and length of time between injury and treatment. Confining the dog may be of some use, but surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is not always successful.
Pekingese make good apartment dogs, and of course they"ll be equally happy in a mansion. They love to run and romp but need a fenced area because they will explore and may wander off. Pekingese appreciate going for walks and will be excellent company jaunting through the neighborhood with you. They will run around the house, especially with another Peke or other dog. Despite their heavy coat, Pekingese are housedogs and should not live outdoors. Their short noses make them sensitive to heat, so they need to live in an air-conditioned environment. Pekes are stubborn and can be difficult to train. They won"t respond at all to harsh corrections or training methods. Reward them any time they do something you like, and be creative in persuading them that what you want them to do is their idea and worth their while.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Pekes are meant to be stocky, muscular dogs who feel heavy when lifted, but they shouldn"t be fat. Keep your Pekingese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs fewer bonbons and more exercise. For more on feeding your Peke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pekingese wears a coat that is long, coarse, and straight, standing away from the body like a furry halo. Beneath the topcoat is a thick, soft undercoat. True to his description as a lion dog, the Pekingese has a noticeable mane on the neck and shoulder area, with the coat on the rest of the body being somewhat shorter. While it should be long and profuse, the coat should not obscure the shape of the body. Long feathering is found on the backs of the legs and on the toes, with longer fringing on the ears and tail. The Peke"s coat can be any color or have any markings, including black and tan, fawn or red brindle, and particolor, which is white with another color. He may or may not have a black mask. Solid white Pekingese were highly prized by the Chinese and are still popular today. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips, and eye rims is black. Unless you"re showing him, you can brush your Peke"s coat weekly with a small bristle brush, curry brush, or shedding comb. Before brushing, mist the coat lightly with water to prevent the hair from breaking. Brush all the way down to the skin; if you just go over the top of the coat, you won"t get out the dead hair that forms mats and tangles. Continue to mist the hair as you brush each area of the body. Use a metal comb on the feathering and fringing on the legs, ears, and tail. These areas tangle easily, so comb them daily. Clean the face and around the eyes daily with a damp cotton ball to prevent problems with the skin folds in the area. Keep skin folds clean and dry to prevent infections. Any time your Peke gets wet, thoroughly dry the skin folds until no dampness remains. Bathe your Pekingese once or twice a month, as needed. Use a shampoo made for dogs so you don"t dry out his coat. You can also shake on a dry dog shampoo and then brush it out. Trim the hair on the feet to prevent mats from developing and foreign objects from becoming tangled there. Trim the nails regularly, usually every two or three weeks. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Teaching your Peke puppy to accept having his teeth brushed at least weekly (daily is better) can help prevent dental disease later in life, a common problem in small dogs.
A Pekingese is not a good choice for families with toddlers who may treat him roughly without meaning to. The Peke won"t tolerate being grabbed or poked and won"t hesitate to defend himself. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Pekes prefer the company of other Pekingese, but with early socialization they can learn to get along with other dogs (and cats) and may even rule over dogs that are 20 times their size.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  10 inches to 1 foot tall at the shoulderWeight:  Up to 30 poundsLife Span:  12 to 14 years
Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan. They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds developed separately. Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke.For most of us, the easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke and a Cardigan is to look at the tails. Pembrokes" are docked and Cardigans" are long. (Remember it this way: the Pembroke has a "broke" tail; the Cardigan has a long tail like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater.)Pembroke Welsh Corgis (also called Pembrokes, PWCs or Pems) are the smallest of the American Kennel Club"s Herding Group, and are also recognized by the United Kennel Club. Their coats can be red, sable, fawn or tri-colored (red, black and tan), usually with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle and belly. They also may have a narrow blaze on their heads. Pembroke heads are shaped much like the head of a fox. Their eyes are oval-shaped and dark, and their ears are erect.The official AKC breed standard is maintained by the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America.
Pembrokes are vocal dogs that have a tendency to bark at anything and everything. While they are intelligent dogs, they also can be stubborn. If housebreaking is a problem, crate training is advised. Their strong herding instinct may cause them to nip at the heels of children when they are playing. Pembrokes are prone to overeating. Their food intake should be monitored closely. Even though they are small dogs, Pembrokes have a lot of energy and need a healthy amount of exercise each day. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Originating in Pembrokeshire, Wales, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an enchanting dog whose background is steeped in folklore. According to Welsh legend, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sprang from the lairs of fairies and elves!As the legend goes, one day two children were out in the fields tending to their family"s cattle when they found a couple of puppies. The children thought they were foxes, but recognizing something different about them, bundled them up and took them home. Their parents immediately saw that the pups were not foxes, but dogs, and told their children that the pups were a gift from the fairies that lived in the fields. The fairies used them to pull their carriages and sometimes ride into battle.As proof that Pembrokes were indeed the mounts of fairies, the parents pointed to the marks on their backs where the fairy saddle had been placed on their shoulders. The children were delighted and cherished their pups. As they grew, the dogs became treasured companions and learned to help the children take care of the family"s cattle.For those who don"t believe in fairy tales, there are historians who say that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is descended from Vallhunds, Swedish cattle dogs that were brought to Wales by the Vikings in the 9th and 10th centuries. Others think they may have been descended from dogs that were brought to Wales by Flemish weavers in the 12th century.Either way, the breed has a rather misty historical pedigree. Farmers who kept working dogs in the past bred the best dogs for the jobs they wanted them to do. They didn"t keep good records about the matings.In the 1920s, the UK Kennel Club recognized Corgis as purebred dogs. They were officially known as Welsh Corgis when exhibited for the first time in 1925. At that time, Pembrokes and Cardigans were shown in the same class as one breed.Then, in 1934, the Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan as two separate breeds. In that same year, the American Kennel Club followed suit. Pembrokes were first shown in the U.S. in 1936.Pembrokes have slowly gained in popularity in the U.S., and today, are among the top 50 most popular breeds for family pets. They"re also popular with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England, who received her first Pembroke Welsh Corgi from her father (King George VI) in 1933.The puppy"s name was Rozavel Golden Eagle and was a playmate for Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret. Elizabeth has loved the little dogs ever since, and currently has a pack of them lounging around Buckingham Palace.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are between 10 and 12 inches tall at the shoulders, and weigh no more than 30 pounds.
Although Pembrokes are still used as working dogs, they are most often seen as family pets these days. They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. They are easy to train, but don"t expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves.Although they want to please their owners, food is a great motivator for them when training. Proceed with caution: Pembrokes love to eat and can become obese if their food intake isn"t moderated.Pembrokes also make good watchdogs. They can be suspicious of strangers, and will be quick to bark if they feel that something or someone is threatening their home and family.Like every dog, the Pembroke needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pembroke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Pembrokes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pembrokes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Pembrokes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts: This affliction causes opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision Cutaneous Asthenia: Also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis, or dominant collagen dysplasia, this condition causes defective connective tissue in the skin to become fragile, loose, and stretchy. Blood vessels are also affected, leading to excessive bruising and blood blisters. Cystinuria: This is a condition where high levels of a protein, called cystine, are excreted in the urine, and may indicate stone formation. This is usually a problem only in males. Degenerative Myelopathy (DM): This is a progressive degeneration of the nervous and supportive tissue of the spinal cord in the lower back region. It causes rear leg lameness, weakness and eventual paralysis and is often misdiagnosed as disk disease. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Intervertebral Disk Disease: Because of their long backs, Pembrokes are prone to ruptures in a spinal disk. Symptoms include unsteadiness, problems with going up or down stairs and furniture, knuckling over of limbs, weakness, and paralysis. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) with Pulmonary Hypertension: PDA is a congenital defect of the vascular system that allows unoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs. It is usually detected in puppies during veterinary examination. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure within the lungs and is a rare part of the PDA disease. PDA can be surgically corrected. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Retinal Dysplasia: This is an abnormal development of the retina. Sometimes the retina may detach and cause blindness. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.
Athletic and surprisingly fast, Pembrokes were bred to be herding dogs and require plenty of exercise each day. That said, they make fine apartment dogs as long as they get the physical stimulation they need.With their short legs and long backs, they should not be expected to hop up on (or down from) the couch or any other modest height — fractures are common.Pems can adapt quite easily to living in the country or the city. Although their coats are weather-resistant and they do well in most climates, they are very people-oriented, and need to be a part of the family at all times — not left alone in the backyard.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Pembrokes like to eat, and will over-indulge if given the chance. Keep your Pem in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Pembroke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Pembrokes are double-coated, with a thick undercoat and a longer topcoat. They shed continuously, with heavier shedding at least twice a year. You"ll find them in red, sable, black, tri-colored, or fawn, usually with white markings.The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Pems have fluffy coats — long with excessive feathering on the ears, chest, legs and feet.Many Pembrokes have what is called a "fairy saddle" over their back. This marking, which is caused by a change in thickness and direction of a strip of hair, gets its name from legend: According to one, fairies rode Pembrokes in their home country of Wales.Pembrokes are easy to groom, but shedding can be a problem if you don"t keep up with the brushing, especially during the heavier seasonal shedding. When they are shedding the most, daily brushing is recommended. You only need to bathe them as needed, but many people find that regular bathing also helps control heavy shedding.Brush your Pembroke"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Pembroke to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pembrokes have a remarkable affinity for children, but thanks to their herding instincts, they sometimes nip at children"s feet or ankles. Pems are eager learners, though, and can be trained out of this behavior at a young age.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They usually are good with other pets in the household, so long as they have been socialized with them.

The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen (pronounced peh-TEE bah-SAY grih-FON von-day-ON, and nicknamed the PBGV) has a rough, scruffy outline and distinctive long eyebrows, beard, and moustache. They are generally 13 to 15 inches tall, and their bodies are longer than they are tall. PBGVs were bred to hunt small game, such as rabbits, in rough terrain. The PBGV"s coat is moderately long, and harsh to the touch. They are a double-coated breed, and the undercoat is thick and soft. Coat color is white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tri-color, or grizzle markings. In addition to their charmingly tousled appearance, PBGVs have a delightful personality. They are active, happy, curious, and highly intelligent. They are affectionate dogs that need attention from people. They are great with children and people of all ages. They also get along well with other dogs and pets in your family when properly socialized. While PBGVs can have a mind of their own, they respond well to patient, consistent training methods. Bored or lonely PBGVs will find ways to entertain themselves, so it"s important to give yours a variety of toys and things to chew on, as well as keeping him in a safe place where he can"t harm himself or your possessions if you must leave him alone. As delightful as PBGVs are, you should know that according to the American Kennel Club breed standard (standardized guidelines for the breed), the PBGV has "a good voice freely used." It doesn"t take much to translate that into "He likes to bark!" If it"s any consolation, PBGVs usually just bark at something rather than barking just to hear their own voices. Also, like all hounds, the PBGV is governed by his nose. You should always keep your PBGV on a leash when walking in unfenced areas. All it takes is one enticing smell for him to be off on the hunt! They definitely need a fenced yard, but since some PBGVs are escape artists, you"ll need to be sure that it is at least four feet tall (so they can"t jump over it), and regularly inspect it for holes or areas where he might escape. Electric fences don"t deter a PBGV who has seen a rabbit or a squirrel just beyond the boundary. The momentary shock will go unnoticed as he wildly runs after prey. Another disadvantage of an invisible fence is that it doesn"t prevent other dogs from coming into your yard and harming your PBGV. PBGVs are pack animals at heart, and enjoy only one thing more than the company of another dog or pet — your company, of course!
PBGVs are charming and strong-headed. Consistent, patient training is essential. PBGVs can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended. This breed likes to bark. Don"t be surprised by the PBGV that has plenty to say. PBGVs have a lot of energy and stamina. They need exercise every day. They enjoy a good long walk, but don"t turn them off leash because you never know when their hunting instincts will kick in. PBGVs are escape artists! The nose rules! Like all hounds, the PBGV is driven by his nose. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen is one of many small varieties of the French hounds that were developed long ago. The PBGV can be traced back to the 16th century. His name is descriptive with "petit" meaning small, "basset" meaning low to the ground, "griffon" meaning wire-haired, and "vendeen" referring to the part of France where the breed originated. This area of France is on the country"s western coast, and is known for being a tough environment with a lot of thick underbrush, rocks and brambles. Although the breed had been in existence for centuries, breeders didn"t standardize the breed type until the last part of the 1800s. The official breed standard was adopted in 1898. At that time, they were called the Basset Griffon Francais. In 1907, when the Club du Basset Griffon Vendéen was formed, the same breed standard was used for both the Petit and Grand Basset Griffon, with the only difference being size. Often, both types were born in the same litter (the large and the small Griffons). In 1909, the club rewrote the standard to recognize two types of Basset. The Petit was to be 13 to 15 inches tall and the Grand was to be 15 to 17 inches tall. In the 1950s, the Societe de Venerie published a book of standards that included an official breed standard just for PBGVs. From that time on, they"ve been considered a separate breed from the Grands. Many breeders continued to breed Petits with Grands. However, Hubert Dezamy, third President of the French Basset club, rallied support to forbid this. Because of this recent interbreeding, litters today may include pups that have characteristics of both the Grand and Petit Bassets. PBGVs made their debut at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York in 1992. The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen Club of America was formed at the AKC Centennial Show in Philadelphia in November 1984. By the end of 1985, the club"s membership had grown from 11 to 50 members, and a breed standard had been drafted. On July 1, 1989, the PBGV became eligible to compete in AKC Miscellaneous class (dogs allowed to compete in the Miscellaneous class are recognized by the AKC, but are not yet eligible to be awarded points towards an AKC championship. It"s a sort of a testing ground for the breed, and many breeds remain in the Miscellaneous class for several years). On February 1, 1991, the breed received full recognition by the AKC and was entered into the Hound group at that time.
Males and females stand 13 to 15 inches tall, and weigh 30 to 40 pounds.
The PBGV is known as the "happy breed." This breed enjoys life and people. He is enthusiastic and good-natured. The PBGV is also an active breed. Unlike some other hounds in his group (Basset, for example) that are typically laid back, the PBGV is busy, and requires an active owner to keep him occupied. PBGVs can be willful, but they are generally so charming about it that you end up laughing instead of scolding them. If you want him to be well-trained, you"ll need to be patient and firm. PBGVs are good watchdogs because they love to bark! It"s wise to train them to be quiet on command. PBGVs are very curious dogs that also happen to be great escape artists. If they can, they will either go over a fence, or under it by digging. A tall fence is recommended, plus regular checks of the fence to make sure the PBGV isn"t digging an escape tunnel.
PBGVs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all PBGVs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In PBGVs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). PBGV Pain Syndrome: This is a miserable condition that affects 6- to 18-month-old dogs. Symptoms include bouts of pain, fever, and/or listlessness. The intensity of the pain varies from very mild in some dogs to quite severe in others. Some dogs suffer only a single episode, but most affected dogs have several. One of the more severe forms of this condition affects the cervical area of the neck, giving the problem its common names: the "neck thing" and, more formally, steroid-responsive meningitis. Most dogs outgrow the problem, but some can suffer permanent complications. Epilepsy: This is a puzzling condition that causes dogs to experience seizures for no apparent reason. Some affected dogs experience only one or a few seizures during their lifetime, while others have seizure a regular basis. If necessary, this condition can usually (but not always) be managed successfully with medication. Glaucoma and lens luxation. Glaucoma and lens luxation are eye problems that have been identified in PBGVs only recently. In glaucoma, the pressure inside the eyeball increases and eventually damages the optic nerve, causing blindness. In lens luxation, the lens tilts out if its normal position, causing blindness. Usually, both eyes are affected. These conditions strike dogs around 5 years of age and generally occur together. Allergies: In PBGVs, allergies manifest themselves primarily as chronic inflammation of the ears or as redness of the feet or armpits. In addition to these non-specific allergies, PBGVs can suffer from food allergy, fleabite allergy, hay fever, and vaccine reactions. Most allergies cause only itching, but in some cases, dogs can suffer a great deal of discomfort. Be especially watchful of your dog for a several hours after he has been vaccinated. Inguinal and Umbilical Hernias: Inguinal and umbilical hernias are defects of the abdomen muscles that allow internal organs to protrude and form a bubble under the skin on the belly (umbilical hernia) or in the groin (inguinal hernia). The condition sometimes corrects itself as the puppy grows, but surgery may be required. Patellar Luxation and Hip Dysplasia: Patellar luxation ("trick knee") and hip dysplasia are caused by the abnormal development of the knee and hip joints, respectively. Patellar luxation, also called slipping kneecaps, is more common in PBGVs than hip dysplasia. Either can lead to lameness and arthritis in old age. Your vet will be able to tell if this is a potential problem and may want to do x-rays to evaluate the condition. Treatment often consists of giving the dog nutritional supplements, and may occasionally require surgery. Hypothyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn"t produce enough thyroid hormones. Symptoms include obesity, lethargy, poor coat quality, dry, scaly skin, intolerance to cold and, some think, irritability or aggression. Middle-age and older dogs appear to be the most affected, but symptoms can appear at any age. This condition usually can be effectively treated with medication. Persistent Pupillary Pembranes (PPM) and Multifocal Retinal Dysplasia: Persistent pupillary membranes and multifocal retinal dysplasia (retinal folds) are congenital eye defects. Fortunately, the dog"s vision usually isn"t affected, many consider these primarily cosmetic defects.
Because of their small size and love of being with people, PBGVs can be apartment dwellers as long as you make the commitment to daily exercise. They are generally active when inside the house, so it good to have plenty of sturdy toys on hand. While they do well in most climates, they prefer cooler temperatures. The breed"s nose and hunting instinct is strong, so the PBGV should not be allowed to run off-leash. A secure, fenced yard is best.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your PBGV, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The PBGV"s coat is rough, medium long, and harsh to the touch, while his undercoat is thick, soft and short. He has long eyebrows that stick out so they don"t obscure the eyes, and the ears are covered with long hair. They also have long hair around their mouths, forming a beard and moustache. Their tails have quite a bit of hair, too. Overall, the PBGV has a casual, tousled appearance. PBGVs come in a wide range of colors and can be white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tricolor, or grizzle markings. Grooming is a cinch. PBGVs need to be brushed at least once a week to remove loose and dead hair, and control shedding. You should bathe your PBGV only when needed. The toenails need to be trimmed periodically, and ears checked and cleaned as needed. No trimming is necessary.
The friendly PBGV loves children. He enjoys the noise and activity associated with children. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets; this is especially important with the PBGV is ensure that gates or doors are not left open, giving him an opportunity to escape. The PBV can be trustworthy with other pets, given proper training and socialization. He especially enjoys the companionship of other dogs. He is a hunter at heart, though, and is likely to chase small animals that run away.

The Pharaoh Hound has a remarkable personality characterized by an immense joy of life. Intelligent and affectionate, he takes life as it comes and enjoys clowning for his people. As with any hound, he has moments of aloofness and can be strong-willed. But in the main he"s a gentle dog who gets along well with others, including children and other dogs. He loves human companionship and will seek out affection and attention from his people while still maintaining his independence. One of his most endearing traits is his ability to blush. You may spot a deep rose color on his nose and ears when he"s excited, happy, or enjoying some affection. Many owners will train their Pharaoh Hounds to smile. Since this fun-loving breed enjoys smiling so much, it isn"t a hard trick to teach. While he"s too friendly to serve as a guard dog, the Pharaoh Hound will bark to alert you to anyone or anything that seems suspicious. Unfortunately, a lot of things look suspicious to a Pharaoh Hound. He"ll also bark if he"s left alone for too long or when he"s bored, so it"s best not to leave him alone for long periods. It"s wise to keep this dog on leash whenever he"s in an unfenced area. Even if he obeys your every command at home, his prey instinct is so strong he"ll be off — and temporarily deaf to your commands — if he spots anything interesting.
Introduce your Hound to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences, preferably as a puppy. He can be sensitive to changes in schedules and stress, and an unsocialized dog has a harder time adapting to abrupt changes. A properly socialized is a polite and undemanding dog who is wonderful with strangers and other dogs. Pharaoh Hounds can get cold very easily, but they can live in a chilly climate if they"re kept indoors and wear a warm coat on wintertime walks. Don"t let your Pharaoh Hound run off-leash in an unfenced area. He"s got a strong prey drive and will chase other animals for miles. Backyard fences should be too high to jump or climb, and preferably solid so he can"t see through it. Underground electronic fencing won"t stop a Pharaoh Hound with something interesting in his sights. Pharaoh Hounds can do well in homes with other canines but smaller dogs may trigger their prey drive — as will small pets such as cats and rabbits — and some Pharaoh Hounds are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender. Although sighthounds are not known as barkers, the Pharaoh Hound is an exception. They bark when chasing prey, when they see intruders or hear an unusual noise, or when bored. They can indulge in long bark-a-thons, usually when you"re away from the house, which could cause problems if you live in a place with noise restrictions or neighbors that could be disturbed. Pharaoh Hounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog. The thin coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears and nicks. Coprophagia, better known as stool eating, is commonly seen in the Pharaoh Hound. The best way to avoid this habit is to scoop the poop right away. Pharaoh Hounds require at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Pharaoh Hound is an ancient breed that originated in Egypt, and many reminders of its long history can be found in art and literature. An artifact from 4000 BC depicts two Pharaoh Hound-shaped dogs hunting gazelles; a dog resembling the Pharaoh Hound was often depicted as the companion of kings and nobles in ancient Egyptian art; and a letter dating to the 19th Egyptian dynasty mentions a red long-tailed dog whose face glows like a God, a reference no doubt to the breed"s habit of blushing. From Egypt, the Pharaoh Hound was imported into Malta by Phoenician traders. There they were called the "Kelb tal-Fenek," meaning "dog of the rabbit," after the prey the local hunters used the dog to catch. The breed thrived and became the official dog of Malta. The Pharaoh Hound remained largely unknown in the west until arriving in England in the 1930s. The first Pharaoh Hounds were imported into the U.S. in 1967. The Pharaoh Hound Club of America was founded in 1970, and the breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1984. The Pharaoh Hound is still an uncommon breed, but he can be found throughout the world, wherever people appreciate his unique appearance and personality.
The athletic Pharaoh Hound has a lithe and powerful build. They should be slightly longer than they are tall, with males standing 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder, females 21 to 24 inches. Pharaoh Hounds generally weigh 45 to 55 pounds.
Pharaoh Hounds love their own people and happily entertain them with their clownish antics. The flip side is that they can be aloof with new people. This is a dog who likes to have his own way. Still, he"s smart and willing to please — most of the time — which generally makes training easy. The Pharaoh Hound can be a bit of a sensitive plant. He picks up on people"s feelings and may find a high-drama home very stressful. It"s always important to introduce a dog to lots of new people and situations as a puppy, but this is particularly true with a Pharaoh who can grow up to be timid. Enroll your Hound in a class. Help him polish his social skills, and invite visitors over regularly, and take him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors.
Pharaoh Hounds are generally healthy, but as with breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pharaoh Hounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Pharaoh Hounds are not as sensitive to anesthesia as other sighthounds, but your veterinarian should be aware of the potential risks. The most important rule is to administer to effectiveness not weight. Because of their low body fat, sighthounds can be sensitive to anesthesia, and what would be a normal dose for another dog of his weight can harm or even kill a sighthound. Pharaoh Hounds are less sensitive than some other breeds, but you"ll need to find a vet who"s aware of the risks and knows how to dose your dog properly if he ever needs anesthesia. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pharaoh Hounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
With their calm nature, Pharaoh Hounds can live in an apartment or condo, though his barking has the potential to annoy close neighbors. If you leave him in a yard, you"ll need a fence that"s too high for him to climb or jump, preferably solid so he can"t see the squirrels or cats on the other side. Electronic fencing won"t cut it with this breed — no shock will stop a Pharaoh Hound once he decides to chase something. Because of his thin skin, he gets cold easily and will need a dog sweater or jacket when venturing out on cold or wet days. If you want a well-behaved dog, you"ll need to make sure your high-energy Pharaoh Hound gets at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. This dog can participate in lure coursing and agility, or come with you on a family jog or bike ride. Just make sure you keep him on a leash whenever you"re in an unfenced area. If he sees something small and furry, his strong prey drive will overcome the best training every time. When he"s not distracted by something chase-worthy, however, his intelligence and eagerness to please makes him fairly easy to train. Just make sure you keep lesson time interesting and pleasant; harsh or repetitive training methods don"t work with his sensitive, fun-loving personality. Keep training sessions short and end with something he"s done right so you can praise him for it.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Don"t be fooled into overfeeding; sighthounds have a slim build that many mistake as being underweight. Some Pharaoh Hounds suffer from food allergies; if your dog"s one of them, your vet can recommend a special diet. Keep your Pharaoh Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Pharaoh Hound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pharaoh Hound has a short coat with a fine to slightly harsh texture. His color ranges from a rich tan to a chestnut tan. He may have a dab of white on the tip of the tail, the toes, the chest, or on the center of the face. The Pharaoh Hound sheds (as do all dogs) but a weekly brushing with a hound glove — a rubber mitt with a nubby palm that fits over the hand — removes loose hair and helps keep it from settling on your clothes and furniture. Pharaoh Hounds don"t have a strong doggy odor and don"t need frequent baths. Unless he"s been rolling around in something stinky, wiping him down daily with a damp cloth will in most cases keep him clean. Your Pharaoh Hound"s skin will need some care too. The short coat isn"t very protective, and cuts, scrapes, and other irritations are common. Check your dog for nicks and cuts every time you brush him. Brush your Pharaoh Hound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Check his ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Introduce your Pharaoh Hound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pharaoh Hounds are very affectionate with children. Nonetheless, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Pharaoh Hounds generally get along with other dogs, although some are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender. And because they see small animals as prey, Pharaoh Hounds aren"t suited to sharing a roof with small pets such as rabbits or cats, or even smaller dogs.

You might say the Plott Hound is a dog of a different color. He stands out from the other coonhounds not only for his short brindle or black with brindle coat but also for being the only coonhound not descended from foxhounds. In fact, he"s really more of a big game hound than a coonhound, and Plott people say it"s almost a sin to coonhunt a Plott. This uncommon breed was born and bred in the good ole US of A, but he comes from a type of German bloodhound, the Hanoverian Schweisshund, a breed brought to western North Carolina in 1750 by Johannes Georg Plott, from whom the dogs take their name. The Plott Hound is known for his powerful, streamlined body, intelligence, loyalty, and eager-to-please nature. The nature of the prey he was created to track — bear and wild boar — means that he"s not only strong but fierce in the hunt. That can translate to dominant and aggressive behavior if he"s not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — and trained by someone who can keep him in line with firm and consistent guidance as well as positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior. Plotts are fearless and more protective than the average hound. They"re loyal to their people and will protect their property, but they"re also affectionate enough to be friendly with everyone they meet. They do well in homes with children, although they"re best suited to living with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Plotts can be possessive of their food bowls, and this can pose a problem if a young child tries to snag a handful of kibble. Plott Hounds do very well in homes with multiple dogs and even multiple pets if they are introduced at a young age. They are a pack dog and enjoy the comforts and companionship that living in a pack offers them. Plotts are not necessarily quiet dogs. They have a sharp, high-pitched voice, especially when they scent prey. That"s something to consider if you have neighbors nearby. Due to his dominant streak, the Plott Hound is not a breed for an inexperienced or timid owner. He has his challenges as many other breeds do and it is important to be aware of his limitations as well as the traits that make him an interesting breed. The Plott Hound generally has an even disposition, and given a fenced acreage to roam — or a fenced yard and plenty of exercise — plus a strong leader and, ideally, opportunities to hunt, he"s happy being one of the family.
Plott Hounds generally get along well with other dogs since they are a pack breed and many do best in homes where they are not an only dog. Socialization is a must for this breed. They can be very dominant and should be socialized outside the home to avoid aggressive behavior. Plott Hounds must have training at an early age. They are generally eager to please but without training dominance and aggression problems can arise. Although they do well with older children who understand how to treat dogs, they are not recommended for homes with smaller children. They can become very possessive of food dishes and such. Even the best-trained or socialized dog should not be left alone with a young child. The Plott Hound is an uncommon breed and there may be long waiting lists for a puppy. If you do not wish to adopt an older dog, please be prepared to wait and do not go to irresponsible breeders for a shorter wait. Plott Hounds require at least an hour a day of walking or other exercise. They are not suited to living in apartments. Plott Hounds require weekly brushing as well as other regular grooming care, such as nail trimming and tooth brushing. Plott Hounds are not the best breed for an inexperienced or timid dog owner. Although they are very easy to train, they do have a dominant personality and will disregard an owner that is less sure of him or herself. Plott Hounds should have a fenced yard or be kept on leash since they have a tendency to wander off in pursuit of an interesting scent. They do not have any road sense and will wander into oncoming traffic if their path takes them there. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Plott Hound descends from five Hanoverian Schweisshunds brought to North Carolina in 1750 by German immigrant Johannes Georg Plott. In Germany the dogs had been used as boarhounds, but North Carolina had bears, and that"s what Plott trained his dogs to hunt. Plott"s descendants continued to breed the dogs, and they became known as Plott"s hounds. They spread throughout the Smoky Mountains, with each hunter adding his own touch to the breed, and eventually returned to their roots by being used to hunt wild boar in addition to bear. They were also used to hunt mountain lions and, with judicious crosses to add better treeing ability, raccoons. In the early 1900s, a cross with some black-and-tan hounds owned by a man named Blevins brought the Plotts additional scenting talent as well as the black-saddled brindle pattern. Today, most Plott Hounds trace their pedigrees back to the two legendary hounds that resulted from this cross: Tige and Boss. The breed began to be registered by the United Kennel Club in 1946. The Plott Hound became the official dog of North Carolina in 1989. He"s also registered by the American Kennel Club and is starting to make his way in the show ring. He is still relatively rare, however, and is most often found in the mountains of Appalachia, the Smokies, and other wild parts of the country where his hunting skills are appreciated.
Male Plotts stand 20 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 75 pounds; females stand 20 to 25 inches and weigh 40 to 65 pounds.
The Plott is described as bright, kind, confident, and courageous. He"s loyal to his family and somewhat wary of strangers although he usually warms up quickly to them. He gets along all right with other dogs, but he"s not as friendly toward them as many other hound breeds. You will often see a difference in temperament between Plotts bred for going after big game and those bred to tree raccoons, with the big game dogs having a sharper edge. Like every hound, the Plott has a mind of his own and requires firm, consistent guidance, but in general he wants to please his people. He"s protective of his home and family and makes an excellent watchdog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Plott Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Plott puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Plotts are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Plotts will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Plotts, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death if it isn"t treated.
Although Plott Hounds have moderately low energy indoors, they are active outside. If you don"t have a several fenced acres that they can explore and sniff, expect to give them about an hour of exercise daily. You can break it up into two or three walks or playtimes. The Plott is a walking companion, not a jogger. He likes to meander along and sniff out interesting trails. Plott Hounds should remain on leash when they are not in an enclosed area and they should have a fenced yard when they are left outside. They will wander away, and they have no road sense. They"ll follow an interesting trail right into the path of a car. While a Plott needs a fenced yard for safety, he"s not a yard dog. When you"re home, he should be there with you. Plott Hounds are fairly easy to train due to their intelligence and eager to please temperament. They do have a dominant streak and are not suggested for inexperienced or timid dog owners who are unable to consistently enforce rules and commands. They do well with positive reinforcement, and corrections should never be harsh or cruel. That will only make your Plott become stubborn or sulky. Plott Hounds must be socialized to prevent any aggression problems. Many obedience schools offer puppy socialization classes and this is a great start. Also remember to gradually expose your puppy to various stimuli within the community and in your home. Plotts can be possessive of their food dishes and will attack other dogs and animals that nose around their food. Teaching your Plott Hound to allow people to handle and remove his food dishes is an important training step that cannot be missed. Crate training your Plott Hound will assist in housetraining and protect your belongings from destruction. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Plott doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Plott accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Plott in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Plotts are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Leash training is a must for this breed with its tendency to wander and lack of road sense. With proper training, socialization, and consistent rules, you will find that the Plott Hound is not only a never-say-die hunting companion but also a wonderful foot warmer at night.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether your Plott is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Plotts are one of the breeds prone to gastric dilatation-volvulus, more commonly known as bloat. Feed them two or three times a day rather than once a day, and never let them exercise immediately after a meal. For more on feeding your Plott, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Plott Hound has a smooth coat with hair that ranges in texture from fine to medium coarse. The thick double coat provides plenty of protection against wet or cold weather, a necessity for a hunting dog bred in the mountains of North Carolina. Plott Hounds mostly come in any shade of brindle, which is a coat patterned with specks and streaks of light and dark markings. Brindles can be tan, chocolate, yellow, buckskin, chocolate, orange, gray, blue, liver, brown, and black. You might see a brindle with a black saddle or a black with brindle trim. They can also be solid black or an unusual color called buckskin, which comes in a range of shades: light cream, sandy red, yellow ochre, red fawn, dark fawn or golden tan. Whatever color a Plott is, you might occasionally see a little bit of white on the chest and feet. Plott Hounds are easy to groom. A good brushing once a week with a hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand — or rubber curry brush will leave their coat gleaming. Plott Hounds don"t shed excessively, but that weekly brushing will help keep dead hair off your clothes and furniture. Plott Hounds do not need frequent bathing and can be washed with a dry or foam shampoo. On the occasions when you do give a water bath, use a shampoo formulated for dogs to ensure that the natural oils aren"t stripped from the coat. Because the Plott"s floppy ears can block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Plott may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Plott"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Plott Hound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Plott to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Plott Hounds do well in homes with children, although they"re best suited to living with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Plotts can be possessive of their food bowls, and this can pose a problem if a young child tries to snag a handful of kibble. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Plott Hounds can get along well with other dogs if they"re introduced at a young age. If they raised with them, they can even learn to get along with cats, although they may tree cats they find outside.

As early as the 13th century, nobles hunted with packs of tiny Beagles. Known as "glove Beagles," because they reportedly fit in the palm of a heavy leather hunting glove, they were eventually replaced by the 13-inch and 15-inch Beagles we know today. Some modern-day breeders have attempted to recreate the little hounds, resulting in dogs that are referred to as mini Beagles or olde English pocket Beagles. Whatever his size, it"s difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle"s dark brown or hazel eyes, with their soft, pleading expression. These are happy, outgoing, and loving dogs, characteristics that help balance their inquisitive, determined, and food-focused hound nature. They aren"t yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization is usually reserved for when they catch sight of quarry, or decide to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and their human friends and are inclined to think everyone is their new best friend. The most important thing to know about any size Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his anatomy, and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once famously described his in-laws" Beagle as "a nose with feet." All Beagles of any size need frequent daily walks or active play periods. Expect to give a pocket Beagle at least an hour of exercise daily. And be warned that this isn"t a breed that walks briskly. Beagles mosey, nose to the ground, sniffing out everything around them. Beagles who are left alone and infrequently exercised become destructive. Just because they"re small doesn"t mean they can"t do a number on your décor.
Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate-training is absolutely recommended. Beagles are very intelligent and can get bored if left alone too long. If left outside alone in a backyard, Beagles usually will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to find ways to get out and find some people or other dogs to play with. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling. The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners" neighbors got tired of their baying. Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and then perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped! Beagles are scenthounds and will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world. Although loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist). Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are "chow hounds" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best. Teach children to respect your Beagle while he"s eating, and not to approach or tease him with food. A Beagle takes his food bowl pretty seriously. Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they"re usually friendly to everyone they meet.
The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain. It"s thought that it may have been derived from the French word begueule, meaning open throat, or from the Old English word beag, meaning small. Others think it may have come from the French word beugler, meaning to bellow, or the German word begele, meaning to scold. The breed"s history is cloudy as well because breeds as we know them today didn"t really develop until the 19th century. But Greek documents from 400 B.C. describe Beagle-like dogs, and the Romans may have brought small rabbit-hunting hounds with them to England and bred them with the local hounds. William the Conqueror reportedly brought Talbot hounds (now extinct) to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the Beagle and the Foxhound. Beagles became popular in England early in its history. During the reigns of Edward II (1307 AD - 1327 AD) and Henry VII (1485 AD - 1509 AD), extremely small beagles, called Glove Beagles — small enough to be held in a gloved hand — were popular. There"s also mention of Singing Beagles, named for their bugling voices. Elizabeth I (1533-1603) kept packs of Pocket Beagles who stood only 9 inches tall. These small dogs were depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy nosed. They were used for hunting, but quickly fell out of favor because they weren"t very fast. In the 1700s, fox hunting became popular in England, and the Beagle was supplanted by the larger Foxhound. If it hadn"t been for the farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales who continued to keep packs to hunt rabbit and hare, the breed might have become extinct at that time. In the mid-1800s Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a pack of Beagles in Essex, England. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the modern Beagle. Rev. Honeywood bred for hunting skills, not looks. Thomas Johnson, a fellow Englishman, was responsible for breeding Beagles that were both attractive and good hunters. At about the same time, American breeders started importing Beagles from England to improve the looks of their own dogs. Many of the English imports were bred to an average height of 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder so they could hunt fox. American breeders started breeding them to be smaller for rabbit hunting. Of interest among these rabbit-hunters is the "Patch" Beagle strain, which was developed by Willet Randall in New York around 1880. The line is primarily white with a very large tri-colored spot. They were very popular in the 1940s and 1950s because they were able to run so fast. Today, many people call lemon and white or red and white beagles "Patch" beagles. The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club both were founded in 1884. In that same year, the AKC began registering Beagles. Beagles compete in one of two different height classes: Beagles 13 inches tall and under compete in the 13 inch class and Beagles between 13 and 15 inches tall compete in the 15 inch class. The American Kennel Club does not recognize a variety called the Pocket Beagle. Technically, the Pocket Beagle qualifies as a 13-inch Beagle, which is defined by the Beagle breed standard as any Beagle that doesn"t exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder and typically weighs 15 to 18 pounds.
Breeders of Pocket Beagles put their height at 7 to 12 inches and weight at 7 to 15 pounds.
Beagles are gentle and sweet, smart and funny. They will make you laugh — that is when they"re not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and are often forced to resort to food rewards to lure their hounds into a state of temporary obedience. As with every dog, Beagles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your pocket Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
As with all dog breeds, the Beagle is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions, and Pocket Beagles have more than most. While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Beagles, it is imperative to do your research to find a Beagle who"s been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she"s taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy"s parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, knees, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. So look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Pocket Beagles: Eye disorders including cherry eye, a common condition in which the gland of the third eyelid swells; glaucoma, an increase in the pressure of the fluid inside of the eye; cataracts, a clouded film over the eye lens; retinal dysplasia, a folding or displacement of the retina that can lead to blindness; and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells, which progresses to blindness. Beagles also can suffer from Distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing. Epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures, is fairly common in Beagles. Hypothyroidism, a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues, also is common in the breed. Beagle Dwarfism, which means the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs. Funny Puppy syndrome is a condition where a puppy is much smaller than its littermates and may require special feedings and treatments to survive. They often exhibit soreness in their feet and legs and may not be able to walk normally. Sometimes, these puppies grow up to be sickly dogs, but sometimes they show no signs of problems when mature. Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS) is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities. Cleft Lip or Palate: The lip or palate isn"t completely closed, causing the dog to have difficulty eating, drinking, and breathing. Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testicles to descend from the abdomen. When you have your dog neutered, your vet will be able to remove the undescended testicles, thereby helping your dog avoid health problems that might arise from this condition. Hermaphroditism, the presence of both male and female chromosomes and tissue. Canine Hip Dysplasia, an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Epiphyseal Dysplasia, characterized by abnormally slow growth in the rear legs; sometimes causes soreness. Intervertebral Disc DiseaseI (IDD): Ruptured discs in the spine cause pain and paralysis. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. Patellar luxation ranges from a minor annoyance that causes little pain to a cripping defect.
A pocket Beagle is every bit as much a scenthound as his larger brethren, which means that when outside he should always be on a leash in unconfined areas. He"s a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he"s microchipped and wearing I.D. tags so he can be returned to you. Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn"t prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it. Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply tune out when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat. Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love going for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have adequately trained your dog to come back to you!). They can enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they are 18 months or older before starting them on such a repetitive exercise, or they could experience joint damage. When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, and getting up mostly for meals and an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed is prone to obesity, it"s not a good idea to let this happen.
Recommended daily amount: 7/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they"re willing to eat until they pop. To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Beagle at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your pocket Beagle will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The breed standard for Beagles says any hound color is acceptable. Hound colors include all shades and combinations of white or cream, black, tan, lemon, red, brown, liver, blue, and gray. The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle. The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs, and tip of the tail. All colors can have freckling, mottling (dark roundish blotches on a lighter background), ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), and grizzling (a mixture of black or red and white hairs). Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they"re hunting in tall grass. Although you and I might think a Beagle has a short coat, it"s actually classified as medium length. It"s also smooth, dense, and resistant to rain. Beagles are clean dogs, unless, of course, they"ve found something appealingly stinky to roll in. Otherwise, they don"t require frequent baths. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth. Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it usually isn"t as noticeable as with other breeds. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring. Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn"t circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections, so don"t allow water or oils to enter his ears. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears. You should check your Beagle"s nails once a week and trim them if they are getting long.
Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children. In addition, Beagles tend to be "mouthy," grabbing things, like a child"s hand, with their mouths. They are doing this in fun and can be taught not to do this. Pocket beagles are small and can be easily injured. Make it a rule that young children can hold them only while sitting on the floor. That helps ensure that the dog doesn"t get dropped or carried around like a rag doll. It"s also important never to leave dogs and young children together without supervision. They can hurt each other without meaning to. Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don"t like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.

Affectionately known as the "Royal Dog of Scotland," it is not difficult to imagine how this breed, with its athletic, well-muscled build, came by the title. The Scottish Deerhound has a romantic past, a noble bearing, and a loving nature, so much so that Sir Walter Scott — himself the owner of deerhound named Maida — described the breed as "the most perfect creature of Heaven." What is the allure of this large dog, with his wiry coat and greyhound-type build? Much of it can"t be answered in words but must be witnessed firsthand. The Scottish Deerhound is affectionate toward everyone — family, friends, and strangers alike. He loves children and usually does well with other dogs, although the larger the better. With his long legs, he enjoys a nice jog with a human companion, but afterward is happy to laze around on the sofa and snooze in a sunny spot. This gentle dog has an elegant and polite air but is never aloof. While he"s undoubtedly loyal and courageous, he doesn"t make the best watchdog. His size might be intimidating to someone who doesn"t know him, but he"s too loving and friendly to pose any threat, and it rarely occurs to him to bark when someone approaches his home. He"s highly active as a puppy, but by the time he"s 3 to 5 years old he morphs into a couch potato. Nonetheless, he still requires long walks daily to maintain his tall, gangly body. The Scottish Deerhound is kind enough for people who are inexperienced with dogs, but even a novice should understand that he"s not the easiest breed to train. Deerhounds are lazy and approach training with a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. Although they have a reputation for not doing well in obedience or agility competitions, they can succeed in these arenas if their trainers are willing to put in hard work and consistent training. Scottish Deerhounds may also be slower than other breeds when it comes to housetraining, but the same patience and consistency that gives you a well-trained dog will be an asset with this step in training. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living despite their calm indoor nature. They do best when they have a large yard to run in, and the yard should be fenced to prevent them from chasing "prey" into the street. Underground electronic fencing should not be used with this breed; no shock will stop them once they go into chase mode. They"re best suited to homes without cats or other small pets that may trigger their prey drive. If you can meet the special needs of a giant breed built for speed, the Scottish Deerhound is a devoted companion who will fill your life with all the love his large and dignified heart can give.
Scottish Deerhounds need a securely fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey. Underground electronic fencing will not prevent them from giving chase. The Scottish Deerhound is not recommended in homes with smaller animals and pets that could be considered as "prey." If they are not properly socialized, and for some Scottish Deerhounds even socialization does not curb it, they will give chase whenever they see the other animal. This could result in the smaller animal being killed or injured. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels indoors, they are a large dog and require lots of room to run. They require daily exercise and do best in a home with a large yard or acreage. Scottish Deerhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing a moving animal, but be aware that they can and will lift you off your feet if they do decide to take off and you"re hanging on to the leash. The Scottish Deerhound is a very affectionate breed and will generally befriend everyone he meets. He gets along well with other dogs if they are large and don"t trigger his prey drive. He doesn"t make the best alert or guard dog because of his loving nature. Housetraining can take a bit longer with the Scottish Deerhound than with other breeds. Be patient and consistent. Scottish Deerhounds are relatively inactive inside but still need a lot of daily exercise to maintain their huge bodies. They make great jogging companions and enjoy long, long walks. Many people are surprised when their active Scottish Deerhound puppy turns into a couch potato adult. Scottish Deerhounds do very well with older children, but take into account their size and energy level when they"re outdoors. Don"t let a child walk a Scottish Deerhound; he won"t be able to hang onto him if he decides to run after something. Regardless of breed, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The origins of the Scottish Deerhound are lost in the Highland mists. Over the centuries, they"ve been known as Irish wolfdogs, Scottish greyhounds, rough greyhounds, and Highland deerhounds. Whether they were originally used to hunt wolves and then repurposed to hunt the great stags of the Highlands is unknown, but we do know that they were used as far back as the 16th century to hunt and bring down deer. The deerhounds were highly regarded for their courage and gentle dignity. A nobleman condemned to death could purchase his life with a gift of deerhounds. And only a nobleman could do so; no one beneath the rank of earl could lay claim to a deerhound, which was commonly known as the Royal Dog of Scotland. The breed suffered under its restricted ownership, however, and there were many times it came close to extinction, most nearly when the clan system of Scotland collapsed in 1745 after the fateful battle of Culloden during the Jacobite rebellion against English rule. By 1769 the breed was in dire straits. Efforts were made to restore the breed to its original glory in the 1820s by Archibald and Duncan McNeill. The breed made its way to America as well. The first Scottish Deerhound registered by the American Kennel Club was Bonnie Robin in 1886. During World War I, the breed suffered another decline in numbers when many large estates in Scotland and England were broken up. The Scottish Deerhound became a rare breed again, enjoyed only by a select few. Today the Scottish Deerhound is still a fairly uncommon breed, appreciated by those who love sighthounds or have an interest because of their Scottish heritage, but more are coming to learn that this is a versatile breed and an all-around exceptional dog. Today the Scottish Deerhound ranks 135th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
The average height for a Scottish Deerhound is 30 to 32 inches for a male and from 28 inches and up for a female. Males weigh 85 to 110 pounds, females 75 to 95 pounds.
The Scottish Deerhound can best be described as chivalrous. He"s gentle yet strong, sensitive yet brave. Loyal, devoted, quiet, dignified, and alert are all terms that apply to this dog. He is courageous in the face of danger but never aggressive. Of course, those characteristics don"t just appear. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Scottish Deerhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Deerhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Scottish Deerhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Deerhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Deerhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Scottish Deerhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is believed to be related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of a Scottish Deerhound is generally too high a dose for the low-body-fat Deerhound. It is important to choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds and will be aware of how to dose your Scottish Deerhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, take the time to alert them to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It"s identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred. Osteosarcoma: Most often affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is a lameness in the limb, but the dog will require x-rays to determine the cause. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. Factor VII Deficiency: Factor VII deficiency causes excessive and sometimes fatal bleeding from minor wounds and surgery. A DNA test to identify carriers of Factor VII deficiency is available. This genetic abnormality is present at birth and doesn"t change, so a test at any age is accurate for the dog"s entire life. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Deerhounds are especially prone to inhalant allergies. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.
Scottish Deerhounds are calm and sedate. They enjoy a good run or a long walk, but in the main they"re more mellow than manic. They"ll enjoy any game that involves chasing something, although you shouldn"t expect them to bring it back. Because they"re a giant breed, it"s important to introduce puppies to exercise gradually so you don"t damage their still developing bones and joints. Deerhound puppies need plenty of off-leash exercise in a safely fenced area to develop properly. Give them unrestricted access to a large yard so they can get out and run when the mood strikes them. Start them on walks when they"re 8 weeks old and gradually work them up to a mile or more by the time they"re 12 weeks old. By 6 months of age, they"ll be capable and desirous of much longer walks. They should be two years old before they begin any type of jumping or running. Avoid exercising them on hard surfaces such as concrete as much as possible. In the house, they need a puppy-proofed room where they can stretch out and play, yet not do too much damage. When you"re not there to supervise, confine them to it with a tall dog gate or baby gate. Long hours in a crate can damage their joints. Scottish Deerhounds are not the easiest of breeds to train and require patience and understanding. They enjoy the attention they receive when you"re happy with their behavior, but all in all they"d rather do what they like. They are sensitive and won"t respond to harsh treatment. Positive reinforcement with food rewards, praise, and play is the best training technique to use with this breed, and it"s important to be consistent. With a trainer who"s patient and has a sense of humor, they"ve been known to achieve advanced titles in obedience. Leash training is a must with the Scottish Deerhound. Your Scottish Deerhound must be leashed on walks or his prey drive will kick in when he sees a small animal in motion. Once that happens, nothing will matter to him but the chase, no matter how many frantic commands you shout. While it"s breathtaking to see a Deerhound in action, it"s heartbreaking if he becomes injured in the chase, hurts or kills the animal he"s pursuing, or runs in front of a car and is killed. If you want to see him run and chase, get him involved in lure coursing.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether your Deerhound"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Deerhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The thick coat of a Scottish Deerhound is 3 to 4 inches long, harsh and wiry, meant to protect the dog as he hunted the rough terrain of the Scottish Highlands. In contrast, the hair on the head, belly, and breast is usually quite soft. A slight fringe of hair — not enough to be called feathering — adorns the backs of the legs. Climate affects the texture of the coat, and in the United States Deerhounds commonly have a coat that is a mix of wiry and silky hair. No self-respecting Deerhound has a woolly coat, however, which doesn"t shed dirt the way the wiry coat does. The typical Deerhound wears a coat of dark blue-gray, but the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look — says he also comes in dark gray, brindle, light gray, red fawn, sandy red, or yellow. The latter three colors are especially attractive when the dog has a black muzzle and ears, but it"s unlikely you"ll ever see it. Most Deerhounds come in only three colors: gray, gray, and gray. Once in a while you"ll see a bit of white on the chest or toes, but the less white the better. Scottish Deerhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush the coat with a wire slicker brush once or twice a week to remove dead hair, stimulate the circulation, and distribute natural skin oils. Always brush in the direction the hair grows. Give a final going over with a metal comb — known as a greyhound comb — to be sure you haven"t missed any tangles. You can also use the comb on the softer belly, chest, and facial hair. Using your fingers, gently pluck any long or light-colored hairs from the ears until they look velvety black. Bathe your Deerhound as needed to remove any dust, dirt, or doggy odor that"s developed. A bath will temporarily make his coat feel soft, but it will regain its crisp feel in a few days. With regular brushing, he really shouldn"t need a bath more than a couple of times a year unless you"re showing him. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Deerhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Deerhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Because your Deerhound has floppy ears, you should check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Deerhound may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Begin accustoming your Deerhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult — essential with a dog this size. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Deerhounds can get along with children, but they"re not really a playmate kind of dog, being more into body slams than playing fetch. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Deerhounds aren"t best pleased by the poking, prodding, and pulling of toddlers and will generally stalk off rather than put up with it. Their size also makes them unsuited to life with small children; they can easily knock them over without meaning to. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. While your Deerhound may learn to live peaceably with small dogs or cats indoors, if he sees them running around outdoors it can be a different story.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 5 inches to 1 foot, 8 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  35 to 55 poundsLife Span:  10 to 12 years
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a medium-sized, long-haired dog who, as his name suggests, originates from Poland. Polish Lowland Sheepdog is the literal translation of his Polish name, Polski Owczarek Nizinny (pronounced poll-ski ov-cha-rik nee-shinny). In the United States and Poland, the breed is referred to simply as PON. Although PONs nearly became extinct after World War II, they made a dramatic comeback in the 1950s and — though still relatively rare in the U.S. — they are currently popular in their native Poland as companion dogs for apartment dwellers and as working farm dogs in rural areas. The PON belongs to the American Kennel Club Herding Dog Group. Not surprisingly, the PON has strong herding instincts and a loyal personality. Like other herding breeds, the PON is also an independent thinker. He is a smart, self-confident dog that thrives within a family and typically is wary of strangers. One outstanding characteristic of the PON is his uncanny memory, which makes him a quick study and relatively easy to train. However, he is strong willed and will try to dominate his owner if given the chance. The PON is an active dog who requires a good deal of exercise — don"t expect your PON to be a couch potato — but he isn"t hyperactive or nervous. This is a breed with a strong work ethic who enjoys having a job to do, especially if it means doing it for his family. Obedience training and agility classes are good outlets for the PON, providing him with both mental and physical stimulation. The PON is not a party animal: he tends to attach himself to a select few people and remains aloof with others. It"s important to socialize him from puppyhood so he becomes accustomed to many different kinds of people. Take the cute PON puppy with you to the park or on errands, and let people admire and touch him. The PON is generally good with children and other pets if he is raised with them from puppyhood. Don"t be surprised if he tries to herd the kids, though: he likes to keep his flock (human or otherwise) neatly gathered in one spot. Despite his aloof and hardworking tendencies, the PON is a naturally happy dog with a joyful personality. He also knows what he wants and how to get it. If he has his eye on something, he will typically stare at the object of desire, then glance at you, patiently waiting for you to understand. When his patience wears out, however, he can be a thief, stealing household item such as towels or tools, and stashing them away. As some PON owners say, "First they steal your heart, and then they steal your underwear!" .
The PON appreciates a good meal and would prefer to repeat the experience often every day. Don"t give in when he gives you that pathetic, hungry look. Since he won"t monitor his food intake, you have to: feed him only the amounts appropriate for his size and age, and remember that snacks and treats count. That cute, shaggy PON puppy can easily fool you into thinking he"s an amenable dog who"ll follow your every whim. Not so — the PON has a very strong personality, even as a youngster. He thinks for himself. That"s certainly a good trait for a working dog, but it also means his owner must be firm, fair, and persistent. In other words, you have to be the boss. The PON adores his family, but he"s aloof and suspicious toward strangers. Don"t expect him to greet your dinner guests with a friendly look and a wagging tail. Proper socialization is essential to encourage the PON to be comfortable with a variety of people, so get him out and about among friendly strangers from the very beginning. Puppy classes are an excellent idea. While he isn"t hyperactive, the PON does have a lot of energy and stamina. If he doesn"t get enough mental and physical stimulation, he"ll get bored (don"t we all), which can lead to excessive barking, chewing, or digging. To prevent problem behaviors, keep the PON busy with activities and don"t leave him alone for long periods of time. While the PON"s shaggy coat is adorable, let"s face it: it does require a great deal of grooming. If that"s not for you, or if you can"t delegate the job to another willing family member, consider a different breed. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is an old breed. He is believed to be descended from the Puli, a Hungarian herding dog, as well as central Asian dogs including the Tibetan Mastiff, Tibetan Spaniel, Lhasa Apso, and Tibetan Terrier. One intriguing — and not impossible — theory is that the Huns were responsible for spreading the breed to many different countries as they plundered their way through various cultures. In 1514, a Polish merchant named Kazimierz Grabski sailed from Gdansk to Scotland with a cargo of grain to exchange for Scottish sheep. Six PONs were onboard to herd the sheep and, as the story goes, a Scottish shepherd asked for a pair of PONs in exchange for a ram. The shepherd got a deal: two female PONs and one male. It"s commonly believed that these three dogs were used to crossbreed with Scottish dogs to develop the Bearded Collie. The ongoing story of the PON is a history of survival. In the 1800s, when sheep herding declined in Poland, the number of PONs also declined. World War II, which brought terrible devastation to Poland, almost decimated the breed. Luckily, a Polish veterinarian named Dr. Danuta Hryniewics took action. She began efforts to save the breed with the help of her own PON, a male named Smok. Smok sired 10 litters of PONs in the 1950s; in 1958, the first litter with a full pedigree was born. By 1969, her Kordegardy Kennels had produced more than 140 puppies, including many champions. All PONs in existence today can be traced back to Smok and his progeny. In 1959, a breed standard was written for the PON and accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Not surprisingly, Smok was the model for this standard. In 1979, a U.S. Bearded Collie breeder named Moira Morrison learned of the PON ancestry in her breed. Intrigued, she imported two PONs from Poland — the first known to have come to the U.S. Four years later, Kaz and Betty Augustowski, both of Polish heritage, saw an advertisement in a dog magazine and acquired their first PON. Over the next 18 years, they became passionately involved in getting the breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. Their efforts were rewarded when PONs gained entry into the Miscellaneous class on July 1, 1999, The AKC granted the breed full recognition on August 1, 2001. Although the PON is still rare in America, today it is the most popular of all the native breeds in its home country and is unofficially considered Poland"s national dog.
Males and females stand 17 to 20 inches tall and weigh 35 to 55 pounds.
The PON is a highly intelligent, hardworking dog. He is known for his ability to remember what he learns — both good and bad habits. He is strong willed and can be stubborn, so he needs an owner who will kindly and consistently provide leadership. Otherwise, he will try to rule the roost. Because of his working heritage, the PON likes to be busy, physically and mentally. He needs activities to challenge him: hiking, herding, agility, tracking, and advanced obedience training are all good bets. If he isn"t provided proper outlets for his energy, he is likely to express himself through more annoying amusements such as barking, digging, and chewing. The PON doesn"t make friends with just anyone. He is most comfortable with his family and is suspicious of people he doesn"t know.
PONs are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Canine hip dysplasia is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is actually a family of eye diseases involving the gradual deterioration of the retina. In the early stages of the disease, dogs become night blind; eventually they lose their daytime vision as well.
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog prefers a cooler climate, but he can adapt to warmer temperatures as long as he has adequate, cool shelter. Although the PON is ideally suited for rural life, he does well in apartments and houses without backyards as long as he has a job to do and is taken outside frequently for exercise. If he isn"t herding a flock on a farm, he appreciates the challenge of obedience, agility, or herding competitions, or even just hiking and jogging with you.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. The PON benefits from two meals a day rather than one — and don"t leave food out for him all the time. He"s known for his hearty appetite and will overeat if he can. If you"re unsure whether there"s too much fat under all that fur (it"s hard to tell by simply looking), give him the hands-on test by placing your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel (but not see) his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your PON, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The shaggy PON has a long, dense topcoat and a soft, thick undercoat. The coat comes in many colors; the most common are white with black, gray, or sandy patches; or gray with white or chocolate. Occasionally, a PON is all white, all black, or black and tan. Most PONs are born with a darker puppy coat than they will have as adults, with the exception of puppies born white. The PON is considered a nonshedding breed. When it comes to grooming the PON, the natural look is in. That doesn"t mean the breed doesn"t need grooming — in fact, that shaggy coat needs a lot of grooming to keep it free of tangles, though no trimming is necessary or even recommended. Breed enthusiasts stress the importance of not primping the PON. Plan on brushing and combing thoroughly at least twice a week, and always before bathing (detangling spray is helpful). A bath every two months may be necessary. Like all dogs with fluffy coats, the PON gets dirty easily, so you"re in for muddy paws, leaves or burrs tracked into the house, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet and dirty beard. Trim your PON"s nails once a month, and check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Wipe them out weekly (and after bathing or any other time the PON gets wet) with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. The PON coat can be too much for an inexperienced owner to handle, so you consider having a professional groomer help with the upkeep. That won"t let you completely off the hook, though. You"ll still need to brush that coat thoroughly between professional grooming sessions. If you aren"t crazy about combing and brushing — no doubt about it, it"s a lot of work — you may want to consider another breed.
Your PON will be your devoted, lifelong friend. His loyal nature makes him a loving companion for an individual or family — he"ll consider the family his flock. He gets along with children and other animals best if he"s raised with them. Because he is naturally wary of outsiders (a good trait for a herding/guard dog), the PON is most likely to accept as part of his flock those he knows from puppyhood. He is likely to remain aloof with those he doesn"t know, though he can warm up to family friends and pets with exposure and positive interaction.

Although the Pomeranian (also called Zwergspitz, Dwarf Spitz, Loulou, or, affectionately Pom) only weighs from three to seven pounds, this lively little dog has a personality the size of Texas!The Pomeranian is the smallest member of the Spitz family of dogs, which includes the Samoyed, Alaskan Malamute, and Norwegian Elkhound, among others.Poms take their name from the province of Pomerania, in Germany. They became especially popular when Queen Victoria allowed some of her Pomeranians to be shown in a conformation show, the first Pomeranians ever to be shown.Cute, feisty and furry, Poms are intelligent and loyal to their families. Don"t let their cuteness fool you, however. These independent, bold dogs have minds of their own. They are alert and curious about the world around them. Unfortunately, in their minds, they are much larger than they really are, which can sometimes lead them to harass and even attack much larger dogs.Luckily, if they are properly socialized with other dogs and animals, they generally get along quite well with them.Pomeranians have a wedge-shaped head with erect ears. Some people describe their faces as fox-like, while others think that "baby-doll" or "pansy" is a better description.Their dark, almond-shaped eyes sparkle with intelligence and curiosity. Their noses can be dark or the same color as their coats. Their distinctive plumed tail fans out over their back.Pomeranians come in a wide variety of solid colors, with red, orange, white or cream, blue, brown, or black being the most common. Rarely, you might see a white Pom with colored markings (called parti-colored), or a black and tan one, or even an orange and sable one. The Pom"s profuse double coat stands out from his body, and he has a luxurious ruff around his neck and chest. The coats looks as though it would be difficult to care for, but in reality, regular brushing is typically all it needs.Despite their small size, Pomeranians have a loud bark and make excellent watchdogs. They sometimes don"t know when to stop barking, however, so it"s a good idea to train them to stop barking on command.Pomeranians make excellent pets for older people and those who are busy, because they aren"t an overly dependent breed. They are also good for apartment dwellers or homes that don"t have a backyard. Because of their small size, they aren"t recommended for families with small children who might injure them accidentally.Poms generally are good at learning tricks, but you must be consistent and firm when training them. If you don"t establish yourself as top dog in your household, your Pom will be more than glad to take over and may even become snappish.Poms have a lot of energy and enjoy going for walks. They trot along, proudly holding their head up, meeting new people and exploring new sights and smells.More and more Poms are being trained in obedience, agility, tracking and flyball. Some also have been trained as hearing assistance dogs. They make excellent therapy dogs and bring delight and comfort to the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. If you"d like a pint-size companion with personality plus, the Pomeranian may be the choice for you.
Pomeranians often are suspicious of strangers and can bark a lot. Pomeranians can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. High heat and humidity can cause your Pom to become overheated and possibly have heat stroke. When your Pom is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately. They definitely are housedogs and should not be kept outdoors. While Poms are good with children, they are not a good choice for very young or highly active children because of their small size. Never let your small children and your Pom play without supervision. Because they are so small, Poms can be perceived as prey by owls, eagles, hawks, coyotes, and other wild animals. Never leave them outside unattended, and be watchful if there are predatory birds in your location. If this is the case, stay close to your Pom to discourage birds from trying to carry them off! Because they are small and attractive, Poms are targets for dognappers, another reason why you shouldn"t leave them outside unattended, even in a fenced yard. Although they are small, Poms don"t seem to realize it and can have a "big dog" attitude. This can spell disaster if they decide to chase a bigger dog that they think is encroaching upon their territory, or if they jump from a high place. It"s up to you to make sure that your little one doesn"t harm himself due to not realizing his limitations. When your Pom gets old, he may develop bald spots in his beautiful coat. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Pomeranians were developed in the province of Pomerania from the ancient Spitz breeds of the far northern countries. The closest relatives of the Pomeranian are the Norwegian Elkhound, the Schipperke, the German Spitz, the American Eskimo Dog, the Samoyed, and other members of the Spitz, or Northern, group of dogs, all of which are characterized by their wedge-shaped heads, prick ears, and thick furry coats. Early Pomeranians weighed as much as 30 pounds.Even in the early days of the breed, Poms were popular. Notable people who were said to have Pomeranian-type dogs include theologian Martin Luther, who had a Pom named Belferlein that he mentioned often in his writings; artist Michelangelo, whose Pom sat on a satin pillow and watched him paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; physicist Isaac Newton, whose Pom named Diamond reportedly chewed many of his manuscripts, and composer Mozart, whose Pom was named Pimperl and to whom he dedicated an aria.In 1761, the appeal of Pomeranians moved to England when Sophie Charlotte, a 17-year-old Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (a neighboring province of Pomerania) married the English prince who was to become King George III. She brought with her a pair of mostly white dogs named Phebe and Mercury that weighed more than 20 pounds, which was standard at that time. Although they were popular in royal circles, the new breed didn"t catch on with the public.All of that changed during the reign of Queen Charlotte"s granddaughter, Queen Victoria. During her 64 years as the Queen of England, Queen Victoria bred more than 15 different breeds of dogs. In her later years, she was especially fond of Pomeranians, which she first saw in 1888 during a trip to Italy. She fell in love with a sable and red Pom named Marco who weighed only 12 pounds. Today, many believe that he was the inspiration to breed smaller Pomeranians.Marco went on to compete under the Queen"s name in many dog shows and won many honors. Victoria also bought three other Poms on the same trip to Florence in 1888. After Marco, Victoria"s next most famous Pom was a female named Gina who also became a champion at London dog shows. Victoria loved her Poms so much that as she lay dying, she asked that her favorite Pom (named Turi) be brought to her bedside.Victoria"s love of the Pomeranians, especially the smaller ones, inspired English dog fanciers to begin breeding even smaller Poms. From 1900 until the 1930s, Pomeranians often had the largest number of entries at Crufts dog show, Britain"s national championship. It was during this time that the breed standard was stabilized, with the size coming down to its present weight and the coat developing its characteristic deep frilling. Also during this time, a wider range of colors became available. Early Poms were primarily white, black, chocolate or blue, but after an orange dog began winning at dog shows in the 1920s, the range of colors expanded.The popularity of the Pom spread across the Atlantic. In 1888, a Pomeranian named Dick was the first Pom entered into the American Kennel Club (AKC) stud book. In 1892, the first Pom was entered in a dog show in New York. After the AKC recognized the breed in 1900, Pomeranians quickly grew in popularity in the United States. In 1909, the American Pomeranian Club was accepted as a member club of the AKC and designated as the Parent Club for the breed. By mid-century, Poms were one of the most popular dog breeds in America. Today they rank 14th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Pomeranians are 7 to 12 inches tall and weigh 3 to 7 pounds. Some litters have puppies that are throwbacks to the days when they were larger and grow to be 12 to 14 pounds or more. These puppies can be an excellent choice for families with children.
The extroverted Pomeranian is smart and vivacious. He loves meeting new people and gets along well with other animals, although he sometimes thinks he"s a lot bigger than he is. Don"t let him challenge bigger dogs in his mistaken belief that he"s their size or larger.Alert and inquisitive, Pomeranians make excellent watchdogs and will bark at anything out of the ordinary. Teach them to stop barking on command, though, or they might go on all day long.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy who"s willing to sit nicely on your lap, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Aggression and shyness aren"t characteristics that your Pom puppy will outgrow.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. They should be friendly, calm, quiet, and easy to live with.Like every dog, Pomeranians need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pom puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pomeranians are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poms will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poms, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Allergies: Some Pomeranians can suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. If your Pomeranian is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect that he has an allergy and have him checked by your vet. Epilepsy: Some Pomeranians develop epilepsy and have seizures. If your Pom has seizures, take him to the vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. Eye Problems: Pomeranians are prone to a variety of eye problems, including cataracts, dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) (dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva), and tear duct problems. These problems can appear in young adult dogs and may lead to blindness if untreated. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs occasionally in Pomeranians. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pomeranians usually are able to lead normal, healthy lives, unlike some of the large and giant breeds, who require surgery to get around easily. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pomeranian has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The first signs are limping and atrophy of the leg muscle. Qualified vets can perform a surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a "false joint" and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: This is a very common problem for Poms. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Collapsed Trachea: This is a condition in which the trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a "goose honk." Since it can be caused by pulling too hard against a collar while walking, you should train your Pom to walk nicely beside you instead of pulling at the leash, or use a harness instead of a collar. Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically. Dental Problems: Poms are prone to teeth and gum problems and early tooth loss. Watch for dental problems and take your Pom to the vet for regular dental exams.
Pomeranians are very active indoors and are good choices for apartment dwellers and people without a fenced yard. They have a moderate activity level and will enjoy several short daily walks or play times.They are remarkably hearty and enjoy longer walks, but always keep in mind that they are small and sensitive to heat. They love to play and can get bored easily, so be sure to give them lots of toys and rotate them frequently so there"s always something new. They especially enjoy toys that challenge them.One activity that both you and your Pom will enjoy is trick training. Poms love to learn new things and enjoy being the center of attention, so teaching them tricks is a perfect way to bond with them while providing them with exercise and mental stimulation.They have a short attention span, so keep training sessions brief and fun. Reward your Pom with praise, treats, or play whenever he correctly performs a command or does something else you like.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Pom, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pomeranian"s glory is his thick, stand-out, double coat with an undercoat of soft, thick, fluffy hair and a top coat of long, straight, shiny hair that"s harsh to the touch. The longer hair around the neck and chest forms a frill, enhancing the Pom"s proud appearance.The Pom"s tail is another outstanding characteristic of the breed. The plumed tail with its profusion of hair lies flat, fanning out upon the dog"s back. Interestingly, when Poms are born, their tails don"t look like this. It may take months for the tail to develop this way.One of the great things about Pomeranians is that they come in any color or pattern you can imagine in dogs, including black, black and tan, blue, blue and tan, chocolate, chocolate and tan, cream, cream sable, orange, orange sable, red, red sable, sable (black-tipped hairs on a background of silver, gold, gray, fawn, or brown), brindle (a base color of gold, red, or orange with strong black cross stripes), and white. Poms that are white with patches of any other color are called "parti-colored."Poms are considered to shed moderately. Males typically shed their undercoats once a year. Unspayed females often shed their undercoats when they are in season, after they deliver a litter, and whenever they"re stressed.To keep hair off your clothes and furniture, brush and comb your Pom at least twice weekly with a wire slicker brush and metal comb. This distributes the skin"s natural oils, keeps the coat and skin healthy, and prevent mats or tangles. Be sure you brush and comb all the way down to the skin to remove all the shedding undercoat.Start brushing your Pom at his head, and then part the coat and brush it forward so it falls back in place when you are finished. If you want, you can trim your Pom occasionally for neatness, especially on the feet, around the face and ears, and around the rear end.You can bathe him as often as you like, whether that"s daily or monthly, as long as you use a mild dog shampoo and conditioner. If he starts to smell a little doggy between baths, sprinkle some baby powder on his coat, let it sit a few minutes, and then brush it out.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Poms are prone to dental problems, so this is something that you must be especially watchful for. It"s a good idea to brush their teeth at least once a week, and even better, daily.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Pom enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Pomeranian to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The bold and active Pomeranian loves to play, but he"s best suited to a home with older children who can be trusted to handle him carefully. Many breeders refuse to sell puppies to homes with very young children, for good reason. Sturdy though he is, the diminutive Pom is all too easily injured if he"s accidentally dropped or stepped on by a clumsy child.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pomeranians can get along great with cats and other animals, especially if they"re raised with them. Protect them from bigger dogs. Poms don"t realize just how small they are, and they have no fear of challenging bigger dogs.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 1 inch to 1 foot, 4 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  Starts at 20 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The small, active Shetland Sheepdog (nicknamed the Sheltie) was once a Scottish farmer"s best friend: sounding the alarm when anyone approached the property, barking at birds and other animals to shoo them from the garden, and later, with crosses to Scottish herding dogs, keeping the sheep flocks in line. While at first glance they look like a smaller version of the Rough Collie, the two are distinctly different breeds. Shelties are loving companions for all members of the family, including the kids, but they can be reserved or even shy around strangers. Because of their protective nature, they"re quick to bark if they sense that anything"s amiss in their territory. Training is essential to keep this trait from becoming a nuisance. On the upside, they make excellent watchdogs. You just have to teach them some discrimination. Ask any Sheltie owner, and they"ll probably tell you how smart their dog is. According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an animal intelligence expert, that"s more than pride of ownership talking. In his studies of the intelligence of 132 different dog breeds, Shelties ranked sixth in intelligence by being able to understand a new command after being told it fewer than five times on average, and obeying commands the first time they were given at least 95 percent of the time. Because of their intelligence, willingness to please, and athletic ability, Shelties excel at performance events. In their size group, Shelties typically dominate the field in agility. They"re also exceptionally good in competitive obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding. In fact, Shelties have a reputation for being a little too smart for their own good. This is a breed that needs a job. Without plenty of mental stimulation, Shelties quickly become bored and will invent their own entertainment, which may or may not be to their people"s liking. Shelties retain a strong herding instinct. You"ll find that your Sheltie will enthusiastically chase and try to "herd" squirrels, rabbits, and children, running around them, barking, and nipping. Shelty owners should discourage this habit, especially with children, because it can lead to biting. Never let your Sheltie herd unless it"s in a herding class with appropriate subjects such as ducks or sheep. Shelties are relatively inactive indoors and can handle apartment living if they"re walked daily and aren"t recreational barkers. Otherwise, they need a fenced yard where they can play safely and be prevented from seeking out animals, people, or cars to "herd." Shelties have a long, dense, furry coat and shed heavily. Lots of people don"t realize just how much loose fur they"re letting themselves in for, and many Shelties are given up to rescue groups every year because they shed. Be sure that you and your vacuum cleaner can handle that much hair. Shelties can be a good choice for a working person as they"ll stay home alone contentedly, provided they get their fair share of attention when their people are home. They thrive in an environment where they"re given companionship, playtime, training, and quiet patting. Your love they"ll return tenfold.
Many Shelties are very vocal, and they have a loud, piercing bark. To keep your relations with neighbors friendly, it"s important to train your Sheltie at an early age to stop barking on command. Expect your Sheltie to shed profusely in the spring, and sometimes at other times in the year. Shelties are extremely intelligent and like to have a job to do. They can be stubborn, however. Make training fun and allow them time to make up their own minds to do what you want them to do. Shelties have a lot of energy and need to be able to run. They thrive on activities such as agility and flyball, where they get both mental and physical exercise. Shelties have been popular family dogs for many years. Because there"s a big demand for puppies, there are many poorly bred Shelties for sale. If you"re looking for a puppy, make sure you find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees.
The Sheltie hails from the rugged Shetland Islands, which lie between Scotland and Norway, about 50 miles north of Scotland and a bit south of the Arctic Circle. These islands are also home to other small breeds of animals, such as Shetland Ponies and Shetland Sheep. For many years, the Shetland Sheepdog was called the Toonie, taken from the Norwegian word for farm. Farmers bred the dogs, crossing the Border Collie with smaller dogs, to herd and protect their flocks of Shetland Sheep. Some speculate that one of the tasks of Shetland Sheepdogs was to protect the small sheep from birds. Indeed, many of today"s Shelties seem to have a passion for chasing birds, and some even try to chase airplanes and helicopters flying overhead. In the early 1800s, the Sheltie was brought to England and Scotland, where he was described as a miniature Collie. On the Shetland Islands, the farmers started breeding their small Shelties to be even smaller and fluffier, so they could sell them to visitors to the islands. It"s rumored that a Prince Charles Spaniel (a variety of English Toy Spaniel) and some Pomeranian dogs, left on the island by tourists, were crossed with the native sheepdogs. There was so much crossbreeding that by the end of the 19th century, islanders realized that the original type of dog was disappearing. There was much dissension about what the original dog had looked like, however, and how to get back to it. Some breeders believed they needed to crossbreed with Collies in order to regain the original type, some felt that they should breed only the existing Shelties who were closest to the original type, and others continued to crossbreed indiscriminately with other breeds to develop small, pretty pets. Shelties of all three types were entered in dog shows in the early 20th century, up to World War I. In 1909, England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed. Altogether, 28 Shelties were registered that year as Shetland Collies (rough). Four of them still appear in the pedigrees of many modern champion Shelties: two males named Lerwick Tim and Trim and two females named Inverness Topsy and Inga. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was Lord Scott in 1911. Collie breeders in England were unhappy about the name of the breed, however, and protested to the Kennel Club. This led to the change of the name to Shetland Sheepdog. The Shetland Sheepdog stirred up controversy both in Great Britain and the United States for many years, with rumors of crossbreeding and long-running disagreements about what the breed should look like. As a consequence, many Shetland Sheepdog clubs were formed to support the different viewpoints. Finally, in 1930 the Scottish and English Clubs got together and agreed that the dog "should resemble a collie (rough) in miniature." U.S. breeders imported Shelties from England until the 1950"s, but by that time, American and British Shelties had begun to diverge greatly in type and size. Today, almost all Shetland Sheepdogs in the U.S. are descended from dogs that were imported from England between World Wars I and II. As the breed became more well known, its numbers increased in the U.S. In the 1970s, their popularity exploded and Shelties appeared on the American Kennel Club"s list of the ten most popular dogs in 12 of the next 15 years, peaking in the early 1990s. Today the Sheltie ranks 20th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club. And how is the Sheltie faring in his native Shetland Islands? Ironically, he"s fairly rare in his rugged homeland — the breed has been replaced by the Border Collie.
The Shetland Sheepdog stands between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder, but it"s not unusual for them to be over- or undersize. A typical Sheltie weighs about 22 pounds, but a large one can weigh as much as 35 or 40 pounds.
The Sheltie is intensely loyal, gentle, and sensitive. There"s a wide range of personalities in the breed, from outgoing and boisterous to calm and sedate to shy or retiring. It"s normal for Shelties to be reserved with strangers, but steer clear of dogs that seem overly timid or nervous. If you"re choosing a puppy, it"s fine if they don"t always come right up to a stranger, but they should be happily curious and ready to make friends with someone who sits down on the floor with them. Whatever their personality, Shelties prefer to be with their people at all times and will follow them from room to room during the course of the day. Like all dogs, Shelties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sheltie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Shelties are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shelties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Shelties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, thyroid, and von Willebrand"s disease and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can"t maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy"s grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder"s lines. Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and can be diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Usually both eyes are affected, but not necessarily to the same degree. Those dogs with minor anomaly make fine pets and usually do not lose their eyesight. Those that are more severely affected may lose their eyesight within a few years of diagnosis. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around x1050_300x600_300x250_a"data-id="pb_prebidjs_300x1050_300x600_300x250_a"data-offset="0"class="gpt-ad">

Although today"s Poodles seem to epitomize a life of leisure and luxury, make no mistake: These are real dogs bred to do real jobs. Although it hardly seems possible when you look at a primped-up Poodle in the show ring, the breed was originally a water retriever, a job that requires jumping in the water to fetch waterfowl for hunters. In fact, the English name poodle is derived from the German word pudel, or pudelin, which means to splash in the water. And in France, Poodles are called Caniche, a name derived from chien canard, meaning duck dog. Even the elaborate coat styling that the breed"s known for once had a practical purpose: trimmed areas lightened the weight of the dog"s coat and wouldn"t snag on underwater debris, while long hair around the joints and vital organs protected the dog from the cold water. There are three sizes of Poodle, all considered part of the same breed: going from smallest to largest, these are the Toy, the Miniature, and the Standard. The Standard is probably the oldest of the three varieties, and some still carry on the Poodle tradition of working as a water retriever. No matter the size, Poodles are renowned for a playful but dignified personality and keen intelligence. When it comes to training, this is an "A" student, and the Poodle excels at performance sports such as obedience, agility, and hunt tests. Despite his regal air, the Poodle is no snob. These are people-friendly dogs who want to stay close to their families — they get lonely when left by themselves for long periods — and are always up for a good game.
If you spoil your Poodle and don"t train him, he"s likely to conclude that he"s the alpha dog of the family. This is especially common among the smaller varieties — Miniature and Toy Poodles — who are more likely to be coddled and untrained. Teach your dog good canine manners, and then insist that he use them; it shows him that you"re the leader of the pack. Because of their intelligence and playful nature, obedience training is essential to keep your Poodle"s mind active. A Poodle who is thinking and learning isn"t bored, and therefore won"t find destructive ways to occupy himself. The Poodle coat needs a lot of upkeep to stay beautiful and healthy. Most Poodle owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every three to six weeks. If you want to save money on grooming expenses, you can learn to do it yourself, but it takes time and effort. Poodles have weepy eyes that can stain the surrounding hair. To cut down on stains, gently wipe down the face daily with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dipped in warm water. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Poodle is one of the oldest breeds developed especially for hunting waterfowl. Most historians agree that the Poodle originated in Germany, but developed into his own distinct breed in France. Many believe that the breed is the result of crosses between several European water dogs, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Hungarian, and Russian water dogs. Other historians think that one of the Poodle"s ancestors is the North African Barbet, which was imported to the Iberian Peninsula. After that, the breed arrived in Gaul where it was used for his hunting abilities. It"s also commonly believed that Poodles descended from Asian herding dogs, and then traveled with the Germanic Goth and Ostrogoth tribes to eventually become a German water dog. Yet another theory is that the Poodle descended from dogs that were brought out of the Asian steppes by the conquering North African Berbers and eventually found his way into Portugal in the 8th Century with the Moors. Whatever its ancestry, this is a very old breed. Illustrations of Poodle-like dogs adorn Egyptian and Roman artifacts and tombs dating from the first centuries B.C. The drawings and statues show dogs that look very much like modern-day Poodles, bringing in game nets, herding animals, and retrieving game from marshes. Although some say that the Miniature and Toy Poodles emerged shortly after the Standard, many believe it wasn"t until the 1400s that breeders began producing smaller versions of the Poodle — first the Miniature, then the Toy — to delight the Parisian bourgeoise. The Toy and Miniature varieties were created by breeding small Poodles to each other, not by breeding Poodles to smaller breeds. The French used the larger Standard Poodle for duck hunting, and the mid-sized Miniature Poodle to sniff out truffles in the woods. The tiny Toy Poodle"s main job, on the other hand, was to serve as a companion to the nobility and wealthy merchant class. Well-to-do owners in the Renaissance often carried their Toy Poodles in their large shirtsleeves, leading to the nickname "sleeve dogs." Gypsies and traveling performers learned that Poodles excelled in another canine profession: circus dog. They trained Poodles to perform tricks, dressing them in costumes and sculpting their coats into fanciful shapes to add to their stage appeal. Wealthy patrons took note and started clipping, decorating, and even dying their own Poodle companions. The Kennel Club in England registered their first Poodle in 1874, with the first British club for Poodle fanciers arriving on the scene two years later. It"s not known for sure when Poodles arrived in the U.S., but the American Kennel Club registered their first Poodle in 1886. The Poodle Club of America was founded in 1896, but disbanded shortly thereafter. Poodle enthusiasts reestablished the club in 1931. Poodles were fairly rare in the U.S. until after World War II. By the mid-1950s, however, the Poodle had become the most popular breed in the country, a position he held for more than 20 years.
There are three sizes of Poodle: toy, miniature, and standard. These aren"t different breeds, just different sizes of the same dog. The Toy Poodle stands up to 10 inches tall, and weighs about six to nine pounds. The Miniature Poodle stands 11 to 15 inches tall and weighs 15 to 17 pounds. The Standard Poodle stands 15 inches and taller (usually 22 inches); males weigh 45 to 70 pounds and females weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
Intelligent, loving, loyal, and mischievous are four words Poodle enthusiasts commonly use to describe the breed"s personality. The Poodle is also known for what his fans call "an air of distinction": a dignified attitude that"s hard to describe, but easy to spot in the dog. Despite his regal appearance, the Poodle has a goofy streak and loves to play — he"s always up for a game of any kind. He"s also very fond of people and eager to please. Combine that with his legendary intelligence, and you"ve got a dog that"s highly trainable. A good Poodle who"s been taught canine manners has a calm disposition, especially if he gets regular exercise to burn off his natural energy. Some owners and breeders think the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles are a bit more high-strung than the Standard; however, other breeders and owners disagree with this theory. The Poodle is protective of his home and family, and if strangers approach your house, he"ll sound a warning bark to let you know. And although he"s affectionate with his family, he may take a while to warm up to new people. An outstanding trait of the Poodle is his intelligence. He is often said to have human-like intelligence, an amazing cleverness that astounds his owners. Of course, smart dogs can be difficult to live with. They learn fast — good habits and bad — and they remember everything.
Poodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison"s disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Poodles, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol resulting from other conditions. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Poodle exhibits these two symptoms, take it to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease, including surgery and medication. Epilepsy: A common cause of seizures in all varieties of Poodles is idiopathic epilepsy. It often is inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Poodle has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup. Hip Dysplasia: When the hip socket is poorly formed or the ligaments are loose enough to allow the ball of the thigh bone (femur) to slide part of the way out of the hip socket, it"s called dysplastic. Canine hip dysplasia is inherited, with environmental factors sometimes playing a large part in its development. Over time, there is degeneration of the joint that can cause arthritis and pain, even lameness. Excess weight, excessive or prolonged exercise before maturity, a fast growth rate, and high-calorie or supplemented diets can contribute to the development of canine hip dysplasia. Veterinary care includes nutritional supplements, medication and, in some cases, surgery. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by is an under active thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma and other skin conditions. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Poodle has Legg-perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose sight during the day. Many affected dogs adapt to their limited or loss of vision very well, as long as the surroundings remain the same. Optic Nerve Hypoplasia: This condition is a congenital failure if development of the optic nerve. It causes blindness and abnormal pupil response in the affected eye. Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): SA is a serious problem in Poodles, especially Standards. It"s estimated that 50 percent of all Standard Poodles are carriers, or affected. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that aids in preventing drying of the skin. It"s usually first noticed when the dog is from 1 to 5 years old. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.
Poodles do just fine in any type of home, from apartments to estates, so long as they have regular exercise and plenty of human companionship. They prefer to live indoors with the family, particularly the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles, since they have no trouble getting their ya-yas out in the house.   This intelligent breed learns quickly, but owners should be careful: It"s as easy to accidentally teach your Poodle bad habits as it is to teach him good ones, so if you"re new to dogs, sign up for an obedience class with a skilled trainer. That goes for Toy and Miniature Poodles as well. Many owners of small dogs skip training, and wind up with a badly behaved dog.
Recommended daily amount: Standards, 1.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; Miniatures, 3/4 to 1 cup; Toys, 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Like any breed, the poodle will pack on weight if he"s overfed, which can cause joint problems and other health woes. Limit treats, keep him active, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Although many owners of Miniature or Toy Poodles in particular give their dogs table scraps, resist those pleading eyes — you"ll create a finicky eater. He"ll turn up his nose at dog food, which is healthier for him. Keep your Poodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Poodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Poodle is a non-shedding breed, and a good choice for people with allergies. Many allergic people are able to keep a Poodle with no reaction. The coat comes in many colors, including blue, black, white, gray, silver, brown, café-au-lait, apricot, and cream. The hair is curly, wiry, and dense, and this unique texture can be trimmed, clipped, groomed, shaved, and otherwise manipulated into all kinds of fanciful shapes. If your dog is going to compete in the show ring, however, you can"t go too wild with the styling; the American Kennel Club allows four specific clip styles for Poodles in conformation competitions. Grooming a Poodle isn"t for the faint of heart. Poodles are high-maintenance dogs. He requires regular grooming, every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat in good condition. If you are considering a Poodle, consider the upkeep of the coat and expense of grooming. Don"t be scared, though. There are many ways to style the coat for easier care. In fact, many owners simply shave it off. That said, easy care doesn"t mean without care. Even when clipped short, your Poodle will need to be brushed, bathed, and trimmed every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat clean, short, and tangle free. Most owners pay a professional groomer, but if you"re dedicated and have the time, you can learn to groom your Poodle yourself. You"ll need a good set of electric clippers and blades, a quality pair of scissors, brush, comb, toenail trimmer, and a good how-to grooming book or video — there are many on the market just for Poodle owners. Even if you let a professional handle the complicated stuff, your Poodle needs daily brushing. Because Poodles don"t shed like other breeds, loose hair collects in the coats, and unless it"s brushed out daily, the hair will mat very quickly. Many Poodles have weepy eyes that stain the hair under their eyes. The lighter your dog"s coat, the more noticeable the tearstains. To cut down on staining, wipe around the eyes and face every day with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dampened with warm water. Be sure to check your Poodle"s ears often every week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Breeds with drop-down ears are prone to ear infections because the ear canal stays dark and moist. Also, hair grows in the Poodle"s ear canal. Sometimes, this hair needs to be plucked. Ask your groomer or veterinarian if it"s necessary for your dog. Brush your Poodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Poodle enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Poodle to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Poodle is a wonderful companion for kids, although young kids who don"t know how to handle a dog could accidentally hurt a Toy Poodle, the smallest and most delicate variety of the breed. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Poodles who grow up with other dogs or pets in the house — or who have plenty of opportunities to interact with them in group training classes, dog parks, and the like — will enjoy their company. If your Poodle is used to being the only pet in the household, however, he may need some time and special training to help him accept a newcomer.

Portuguese fishermen ranged from the Atlantic coast of their own country to the frigid fishing grounds of Newfoundland in their quest for cod. Assisting them were medium-size, curly-coated dogs who drove fish into nets, retrieved lost tackle, and swam messages from boat to boat. Known variously as the Cao de Agua (dog of the water) and Portuguese fishing dog, these canine helpmeets developed into what we know today as the Portuguese Water Dog, a calm, intelligent, and — of course — water-loving breed. In fact, one of their distinctive characteristics is their webbed feet. Porties, as they"re nicknamed, are fun-loving and friendly. For an active family, especially one with a swimming pool, nearby beach, or boat, they can be an excellent choice. They thrive with training and are well suited to dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, therapy work, tracking, and water work. No matter what activity you choose, make sure your Portie gets daily exercise — without it they can become frustrated and destructive. Swimming is a natural choice, but they also make great walking or jogging buddies. Like his relative the Poodle, the Portie has a reputation for being hypoallergenic. It"s not quite true — there"s really no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog. All dogs shed and produce dander to some degree. But the Portie doesn"t shed much. (Because the amount of shedding and dander varies from dog to dog — even in the same breed — the best way to know if you"ll have an allergic reaction to a particular dog is to spend time with him.) With training, there"s very little the Portie can"t do. He"s adaptable to many living situations — with enough exercise he can be an apartment dog — and tends to be quiet around the home. Affectionate and loyal, fun-loving and hard working, the Portuguese Water Dog can be a treasured friend to the right person.
Portuguese Water Dogs are energetic and need 30 minutes to an hour of vigorous exercise daily. They love swimming and make excellent jogging companions. Without proper exercise and mental stimulation, Portuguese Water Dogs can become destructive. They especially like to chew. Portuguese Water Dogs are highly intelligent. They love learning new things, but they can also become bored easily, so make training challenging and fun. Portuguese Water Dogs get along well with children and other family pets, especially if they"re raised with them. They can be reserved toward strangers, but are never lacking in love and affection for their families. Portuguese Water Dogs don"t shed much and are often considered hypoallergenic. Keep in mind that all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree, and no dog is completely hypoallergenic. If you have pet allergies, the best way to see if you"ll have a reaction to a particular dog is to spend time with him and watch for symptoms. Portuguese Water Dogs love people and should live in the home with their family. They can adapt to apartment life if they get enough exercise. Portuguese Water Dogs tend to mature more slowly than other breeds. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Portuguese Water Dog descends from dogs used for centuries by Portuguese fishermen to drive fish into nets, retrieve gear from the water, and swim messages from boat to boat. It"s likely he shares an ancestor with the Poodle, who was bred in Germany to be a water retriever. Known in his homeland as the Cao de Agua (dog of the water), the Portie served as a fishing crew member for trips ranging from off the coast of Portugal to Newfoundland. These hard-working fisherdogs almost disappeared in the early 20th century as fishing became more modernized, but a wealthy Portuguese dog lover, Vasco Bensuade, stepped in to save the breed. Fans formed a breed club and wrote a breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look and act — and Porties began to appear at dog shows. A couple of decades later they made their way to England and the United States. The Portuguese Water Dog Club of America formed in 1972, despite the fact that there were only 12 known Porties in the U.S. Just 10 years later, their numbers had increased to 650, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) admitted the dogs to its Miscellaneous Class — sort of a way station for breeds awaiting full recognition. In 1983, the AKC recognized the Portie as a distinct breed. Today, the Portuguese Water Dog ranks 69th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Male Portuguese Water Dogs stand 20 to 23 inches at the shoulder, and weigh 42 to 60 pounds. Females stand 17 to 21 inches, and weigh 35 to 50 pounds.
The Portuguese Water Dog has a lot of great qualities: he"s tireless, and fun loving, with a great sense of humor. He"s also smart enough that he can out think you if you don"t stay a step ahead of him. You may frequently find yourself laughing as he plays the clown to get your attention. You"ll find a range of temperaments in Portuguese Water Dogs. Some are strong-willed, some are laid back, and most fall somewhere in the middle. As with all dogs, Portuguese Water Dogs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Portie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Portuguese Water Dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Porties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is an inherited disease that causes sudden death in puppies between the ages of five weeks and seven months. At this time, there is no cure and no way to determine if a puppy will be affected with the disease. The only way for breeders to prevent producing affected puppies is to avoid breeding carriers of the gene. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Storage Disease (GM1) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme and allows the buildup of toxic substances in the nerve cells. It is fatal to puppies produced by two carriers. A DNA test has been developed to determine whether dogs are normal or carriers. This has dramatically reduced the incidence of both carriers and affected puppies. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Portuguese Water Dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal, an Optigen rating for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and a DNA test for GM1 (storage disease). Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Porties are people lovers and they should live in the home, not outside. Ideally, they"ll have a fenced yard where they can play safely — although with enough exercise, they can adapt to apartment life. A Portie needs 30 minutes to an hour of exercise daily: long walks, jogging or swimming, or games of fetch. With enough exercise, he"s a quiet companion indoors. Without it, well, you may come home to find your belongings chewed to bits. Train your Portuguese Water Dog using positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Avoid endless repetition or he"ll get bored. This is a dog who learns quickly and enjoys mastering new skills. Training your Portuguese Water Dog for obedience, agility, tracking, or water work is a great way to stimulate his mind and give him the activity he enjoys. He can also make a wonderful therapy dog. If nothing else, you can teach him tricks to amaze the neighbors. Any type of training will help you build a special bond with your Portie. Give him a job to do and he"ll be thrilled. Be aware that the Portuguese Water Dog likes to chew. Provide him with plenty of chew toys, rotate them regularly so he doesn"t get bored, and teach him early what"s okay to chew and what"s not.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Portuguese Water Dog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Portie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Portuguese Water Dog has two coat types: curly and wavy. Both types are a single coat, meaning there"s no undercoat. That"s why the Portie doesn"t shed as much as some breeds and why he"s often considered to be hypoallergenic. (Although all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree — there"s no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog.) The Portie"s coat can be black, white, various shades of brown, or black or brown with white. It"s popular to give the Portie a lion clip or a retriever clip. In the lion clip, the muzzle, mid-body, and rear end are short, with a tuft at the end of the tail. In the retriever clip, the coat is clipped or trimmed all over to about an inch in length, following the outline of the body. Brush or comb your Portie two or three times a week to keep the coat tangle-free. Clip or trim the coat monthly to keep it looking neat. With any dog who spends a lot of time in the water, it"s important to give a thorough fresh-water rinse after swimming to remove chemicals, salt, and other substances that can cause coat or skin problems. Wipe out and dry the ears thoroughly as well to prevent infections. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Portie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Portie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to keep his breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better. Start grooming your Portie when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Portuguese Water Dogs make excellent family companions, especially when raised with kids. They can be rambunctious, however, which is often scary or overwhelming for young children. Always teach children how to safely approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling from either party. Porties get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re raised with them. As with all dogs, you should keep an eye on Porties around small pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters.

The Pug"s comical face, with deep wrinkles around big, dark eyes and a flat round face, can"t help but make you smile. It is believed that the Pug"s name comes from the Latin word for "fist" because his face resembles a human fist. Pugs are clowns at heart, but they carry themselves with dignity. Pugs are playful dogs, ready and able for games, but they are also lovers, and must be close to their humans. Pugs love to be the center of attention, and are heartsick if ignored. Pugs are square and thickset, usually weighing no more than 20 pounds. Their heads are large and round, with large, round eyes. They have deep and distinct wrinkles on their faces. Legend has it that the Chinese, who mastered the breeding of this dog, prized these wrinkles because they resembled good luck symbols in their language. Especially prized were dogs with wrinkles that seemed to form the letters for the word "prince" in Chinese. The moles on a Pug"s cheeks are called "beauty spots." His muzzle or mask is black, with a clearly defined "thumb mark" on the forehead and a black trace down the center of the back. His ears are smooth, black and velvety. He has a characteristic undershot jaw (the lower teeth extend slightly beyond the upper teeth) and a tightly curled tail. Personality-wise, Pugs are happy and affectionate, loyal and charming, playful and mischievous. They are very intelligent, however, they can be willful, which makes training challenging. While Pugs can be good watchdogs, they aren"t inclined to be "yappy," something your neighbors will appreciate. If trained and well-socialized, they get along well with other animals and children. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers. Due to the flat shape of the Pug"s face, he does not do well in extremely hot or cold weather, and should be kept indoors. Pugs have a short, double coat, and are known for shedding profusely. If you live with a Pug, it"s a good idea to invest in a quality vacuum cleaner!
Pugs can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended. Pugs can"t tolerate high heat and humidity because of a short muzzle (air cools down when it passes through the noses of dogs with longer muzzles before entering the lungs). When your Pug is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating. Pugs are definitely housedogs and should not be kept outdoors. Despite their short coats, Pugs shed a lot. Pugs wheeze, snort and snore, loudly. Because their eyes are so prominent, Pugs are prone to eye injuries. Pugs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if food intake isn"t monitored carefully. Pugs need human constant human companion. If you own a Pug, expect him to follow you around in the house, sit in your lap, and want to sleep in bed with you. Pug enthusiasts are a fun-loving bunch. They love Pug get-togethers, Pug parades, and dressing up their Pugs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Pugs originated in China, dating back to the Han dynasty (B.C. 206 to A.D. 200). Some historians believe they are related to the Tibetan Mastiff. They were prized by the Emperors of China and lived in luxurious accommodations, sometimes even being guarded by soldiers. Pugs are one of three types of short-nosed dogs that are known to have been bred by the Chinese: the Lion dog, the Pekingese, and the Lo-sze, which was the ancient Pug. Some think that the famous "Foo Dogs" of China are representations of the ancient Pug. Evidence of Pug-like dogs has been found in ancient Tibet and Japan. In the latter 1500s and early 1600s, China began trading with European countries. Reportedly, the first Pugs brought to Europe came with the Dutch traders, who named the breed Mopshond, a name still used today. Pugs quickly became favorites of royal households throughout Europe, and even played a role in the history of many of these families. In Holland, the Pug became the official dog of the House of Orange after a Pug reportedly saved the life of William, Prince of Orange, by giving him a warning that the Spaniards were approaching in 1572. When William of Orange (later called William III) went to England in 1688 with his wife, Mary II, to take the throne from James II, they brought their Pugs with them. It is known that black pugs existed in the 1700s because the famous artist, William Hogarth, was a Pug enthusiast. He portrayed a black Pug and many others in his famous paintings. In 1785, Goya also portrayed Pugs in his paintings. As the Pug"s popularity spread throughout Europe, it was often known by different names in different countries. In France, it was called Carlin; in Spain Dogullo; in Germany Mops; and in Italy, Caganlino. Marie Antoinette had a Pug named Mops before she married Louis XVI at the age of 15. Another famous Frenchwoman, Josephine Bonaparte, had a Pug named Fortune. Before she married Napoleon Bonaparte, she was confined at Les Carmes prison. Since her beloved Pug was the only "visitor" she was allowed, she would conceal messages in his collar to take to her family. In the early 1800s, Pugs were standardized as a breed with two lines becoming dominant in England. One line was called the Morrison line and, reportedly, was founded upon the royal dogs of Queen Charlotte, wife of George III. The other line was developed by Lord and Lady Willoughby d"Eresby, and was founded on dogs imported from Russia or Hungary. Pugs were first exhibited in England in 1861. The studbook began in 1871 with 66 Pugs in the first volume. Meanwhile, in China, Pugs continued to be bred by the royal families. When the British overran the Chinese Imperial Palace in 1860, they discovered several Pugs, and brought some of the little dogs back to England with them. Two Pugs named Lamb and Moss were brought to England. These two "pure" Chinese lines were bred and produced Click. He was an outstanding dog and was bred many times to dogs of both the Willoughby and Morrison lines. Click is credited with making Pugs a better breed overall and shaping the modern Pug as we know it today. Pugs became very popular during the Victorian era and were featured in many paintings, postcards, and figurines of the period. Often, they were depicted wearing wide, decorative collars or large bows around their short, thick necks. Queen Victoria had many Pugs, and also bred them. The queen preferred apricot-fawn Pugs, whereas another Pug fancier, Lady Brassey, made black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Pugs were introduced to the United States after the Civil War, and the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. At first, Pugs were very popular, but by the turn of the century, interest in the breed waned. A few dedicated breeders kept breeding and, after some years, the breed regained popularity. Founded in 1931, the Pug Dog Club of America was also recognized by the AKC that year.
Pugs weigh between 14 and 18 pounds (male and female). Generally, they are 10 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder.
Don"t expect a Pug to hunt, guard or retrieve. Pugs were bred to be companions, and that"s exactly what they do best. The Pug craves affection — and your lap — and is very unhappy if his devotion isn"t reciprocated. He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie. This doesn"t mean the Pug is a stick-in-the-mud. Au contraire. He is a playful, comical dog that enjoys living it up, and delights his owner with silly antics. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Pug needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pug puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pugs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pugs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pugs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cheyletiella Dermatitis (Walking Dandruff): This is a skin condition that is caused by a small mite. If you see heavy dandruff, especially down the middle of the back, contact your vet. The mites that cause this condition are contagious, which means all pets in the household need to treated. Pug Dog Encephalitis: PDE is a fatal inflammatory brain disease that is unique to Pugs. Medical researchers don"t know why Pugs develop this condition; there is no way test for it or to treat it. A diagnosis of PDE can only be made by testing the brain tissue of the dog after it dies. PDE usually affects young dogs, causing them to seizure, circle, become blind, then fall into a coma and die. This can happen in a few days or weeks. Since PDE seems to have a genetic component, the Pug Dog Club of America, along with the American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation, is sponsoring research projects to try to learn more about this devastating disease. Epilepsy: PDE isn"t the only thing that can cause Pugs to seizure. They are prone to a condition called idiopathic epilepsy: seizures for no known reason. If your Pug has seizures, take him to your vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. Nerve Degeneration: Older Pugs that drag their rear, stagger, have trouble jumping up or down, or become incontinent may be suffering from nerve degeneration. Pugs affected with this condition don"t appear to be in pain and the condition usually advances slowly. Researchers aren"t sure why it occurs. Since their front legs often remain strong, some owners buy carts to help their Pugs get around, and the veterinarian might be able to prescribe medication to help alleviate symptoms. Corneal Ulcers: Because his eyes are so large and prominent, the Pug"s eyes can be injured easily or develop ulcers on the cornea (the clear part of the eye). If your Pug squints or the eyes look red and tear excessively, contact your vet immediately. Corneal ulcers usually respond well to medication, but if left untreated, can cause blindness or even rupture the eye. Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Pugs. They can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care. Eye Problems: Because their large eyes bulge, Pugs are prone to a variety of eye problems, including proptosis (the eyeball is dislodged from the eye socket and the eyelid clamps behind it); distichiasis (an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye); progressive retinal atrophy (a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that leads to blindness); and entropion (the eyelid, usually the lower lid, rolls inward, causing the hair on the lid to rub on the eye and irritate it). Allergies: Some Pugs suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact to food allergies. If your Pug is licking at his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect allergy and have him checked by your vet. Demodectic Mange: Also called demodicosis, all dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems. If your Pug has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, it can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly, skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. Staph Infection: Staph bacteria is commonly found on skin, but some dogs will develop pimples and infected hair follicles if their immune systems are stressed. The lesions can look like hives where there is hair; on areas without hair, the lesions can look like ringworm. You should contact your vet for appropriate treatment. Yeast Infection: If your Pug smells bad, is itchy and has blackened, thickened skin, he may have a yeast infection. It commonly affects the armpits, feet, groin, neck, and inside the ears. Your vet can prescribe medications to clear this up. Hemi-vertebrae: Short-nosed breeds, such as Pugs, Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, can have misshaped vertebrae. Sometimes, only a few of the vertebrae are affected and the dog is able to live a normal life. Others will stagger and display an uncoordinated, weak gait between 4 and 6 months of age. Some dogs get progressively worse and may even become paralyzed. The cause of the condition is unknown. Surgery can help. Hip Dysplasia: This malady affects small breeds as well as large breeds, including Pugs. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pugs are usually able to lead normal, healthy lives with proper veterinary attention. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pug has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Pugs suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your Pug carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.
Though playful and rambunctious, the Pug is a low-maintenance companion, making it ideal for older owners. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers as well. Their compact package belies a great deal of energy, so expect to be entertained with some goofy antics if your Pug doesn"t get a walk or some playtime. They are sensitive to heat and humidity, however, so if you live in a hot or humid environment, be sure your Pug doesn"t spend too much time outside. Light sleepers may also want to invest in a pair of ear plugs — Pugs are prone to snore.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. While the Pug"s first love is human attention, his second love is food. These dogs love to eat, eat, eat. This, combined with their small stature, puts them at risk for obesity. As a Pug owner, you must show great restraint. Do not indulge him with food. Feed appropriate portions, limit treats and encourage exercise. For more on feeding your Pug, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Even though the coats are short, Pugs are a double-coated breed. Pugs are typically fawn-colored or black. The fawn color can have different tints, such as apricot or silver, and all Pugs have a short, flat, black muzzle. The coat is short and smooth, but don"t be deceived. Pugs shed like crazy, especially in summer. The wise Pug owner accepts this, and adjusts her wardrobe accordingly, wearing light-colored clothing that better hides hair. Following that, regular brushing and bathing helps keep the coat in good condition and shedding to a minimum. A monthly bath is sufficient, though some owners bathe their Pugs more frequently. The Pug"s small size is handy: you can drop him right in the kitchen or utility sink for a bath. Regular nail trimming is essential, since these housedogs don"t usually wear down their nails outdoors like active breeds do. It"s a good idea to clean the Pug"s ears every few weeks, as well. What requires special attention is the Pug"s facial wrinkles. These folds are hotbeds for infection if allowed to become damp or dirty. The wrinkles must be dried thoroughly after bathing, and wiped out in-between baths. Some owners simply use a dry cotton ball; others use commercial baby wipes to wipe out the folds. Additionally, the Pug"s bulging eyes need special attention. Because they protrude, the eyes are vulnerable to injury and irritation from soaps and chemicals. Like many small breeds, the Pug can be susceptible to gum disease. Regular brushing with a small, soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste helps prevent this. Begin accustoming your Pug to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pugs love kids. Though small, the Pug is not delicate like some toy breeds, so he is a good breed choice for families with children. However, children who want an active pet to retrieve balls or play soccer will be disappointed with a Pug. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets. Properly trained and socialized, the Pug enjoys the companionship of dogs, and can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.

Puggles are a cross breed of the Pug and Beagle. They have the wrinkles of their Pug parents and the longer muzzle, ears, and tail of a Beagle — a look that draws comparisons to miniature Mastiffs. This unique appearance and his friendly nature has driven a rapid rise in popularity since the first Puggle was bred in the 1990s. Cross breeds such as the Puggle are often referred to as designer dogs rather than mixed breeds because they"re bred on purpose and are a combination of two known breeds. People who raise them hope to end up with the best of both worlds: for instance, the Pug"s laidback personality and the Beagle"s longer nose, which makes breathing easier. Sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn"t; it all depends on the shuffle of the genetic cards. Puggles are active. Not content to laze around the house, they play energetically indoors and out, racing around the dining room table and down the hall. Some enjoy digging outdoors. Expect to give them at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. Puggles are good walking companions, but they"re not the best choice if you want a jogging partner. Agility training is a good way to direct your fun-loving Puggle"s need for speed. Puggles are smart, but they may or may not be eager to please. Neither the Pug nor the Beagle is especially known for ease of training, and both breeds can be stubborn. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise, and keep training sessions short and sweet. Being a social dog, the Puggle gets along well with everyone. He usually enjoys the company of children and isn"t known for aggression toward other dogs. Puggles will bark to let you know when someone comes to the door, but given their friendly nature, they"re not guard dogs. Some are howlers, a trait inherited from their Beagle parent. The Puggle can be a cute and cuddly lovebug. Before you fall in love with that wrinkled face and hang-down ears, however, it"s important to understand that you could end up with a dog that displays one or more of the worst characteristics of the Pug and the Beagle, such as respiratory problems (Pug), stubbornness (Pug and Beagle), tendency to wander (Beagle), howling (Beagle), hip dysplasia (both), and eye problems (both). If you"re willing to welcome whatever surprises this little dog brings, you"re sure to enjoy life with your new dog.
The Puggle is a cross breed — a mix of the Pug and Beagle — rather than a true breed. Puggles are active and energetic. They need daily exercise and will enjoy a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes. Puggles shed, and need weekly brushing to get rid of loose or dead hair. They also require some special care to keep their skin folds and wrinkles clean and dry. Puggles are smart, but they can be stubborn. Train them with positive reinforcement techniques, such as food rewards, praise, and play. Puggles generally do well with other dogs and pets, although they may chase smaller pets.. Loving and gentle, the Puggle can make an excellent companion to anyone, including first-time dog owners, and will do well with children of all ages. Puggles are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety when they"re left alone for long periods. Puggles can adapt to any type of home, from city apartment to suburban house. However, beware if your housing has noise restrictions — barking or howling is a common trait in Puggles. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The Puggle is the result of an accidental cross breeding between a Pug and a Beagle, probably sometime in the 1990s. The breed has become very popular, thaks to his novelty, sweet nature, and cute looks. There are no breed clubs for the Puggle, and no efforts to make him a recognized breed. Most litters are the result of first generation breedings between Beagles and Pugs, but there have been a few breedings of Puggles to Puggles.
Most Puggles are 13 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 18 to 30 pounds. Toy-size Puggles are usually less than 13 inches tall and weigh 8 to 17 pounds.
The Puggle is a sweet, intelligent dog who can fit easily into family life. They can be playful and cuddly and enjoy spending time with the people in their lives. Puggles usually get along well with everyone, including kids and other pets. Potential behavior problems include howling, barking, digging, or wandering. Like all dogs, Puggles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puggle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Not all Puggles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Stenotic Nares, also known as pinched nostrils, is a congenital disorder (meaning the dog is born with it). It affects dogs with short muzzles and makes it difficult for them to breathe. Signs include noisy breathing and exercise intolerance. Dogs that aren"t getting enough oxygen may have blue gums. Mild cases can be managed by preventing obesity, limiting exercise during hot or humid weather, and using a harness instead of a neck collar. More severe cases may require surgical repair. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with daily medication. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog that is being treated for hypothyroidism can live a full and happy life. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Epilepsy is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of epilepsy, which can be either hereditary or of unknown cause. Cherry Eye occurs when the gland located in the dog"s third eyelid (known as the nictitating membrane) bulges out. It looks like a reddened mass at the inner corner of the eye. Cherry eye can be repaired surgically. If you"re buying a Puggle, it"s important to research the health conditions that affect both the Pug and the Beagle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, patellas (knees), and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Puggles are people-lovers and should live indoors with the family, not outside. So long as they"re indoor dogs and get enough exercise, they can adapt to any living situation, including apartments — although they can bark a lot. Some even have a tendency to howl, a trait they inherit from their Beagle parent. Puggles are intelligent but can be stubborn. They"ll respond best to training that uses positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Ample exercise will help keep them from becoming unruly. Give your Puggle a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes every day. Be sure to always walk your Puggle on leash or play with him in a securely fenced area. Beagles may ignore commands when they"ve picked up an interesting scent, and some Puggles have the same tendency.
Recommended daily amount: 5/8 to 1.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Like their parent breeds, Puggles enjoy their meals and are prone to obesity. Keep your Puggle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Puggle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Puggle has a short, smooth, double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, covered by a slightly longer topcoat. Colors include fawn, red, tan, lemon, black, or any of those colors with white (known as particolor). Some Puggles have black masks on the face. Puggles shed, like both their parent breeds. Brush your Puggle weekly to get rid of excess hair. Bathe him only as needed, but be sure to keep the folds on his skin and around his muzzle and eyes free of dirt, debris, and moisture to prevent infections. After a bath, it"s very important to dry thoroughly between any folds. Check your Puggle"s eyes regularly to ensure that they"re clean and free of any irritation, indicated by redness or discharge. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Puggle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Puggle jumps up to greet you. Start grooming your Puggle when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Puggle is generally a sweet-tempered dog who gets along well with children of all ages. Even so, it"s important to always teach children how to approach and touch your Puggle, and to supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party. Puggles are sociable and generally do well with other dogs and pets. They may chase smaller pets, however, especially if they"ve inherited their Beagle parent"s hunting instincts. Proper training, plus lots of exposure to small pets, beginning in puppyhood, can minimize this trait.

The Puli, also known as the Hungarian Puli and the Hungarian Water Dog, is still used for herding sheep in his homeland. Hungarian shepherds take great pride in the Puli and his abilities; there"s a saying among Hungarian shepherds: "He"s not a dog, he"s a Puli." Pulik (the plural form of Puli) are self-confident, highly intelligent, and sensitive to their owners. Many tend to act as babysitters and guardians of children and other animals in the family. They can be very sensitive to the needs of the elderly and the sick. making them great therapy dogs. Although he"s affectionate and enjoys (and expects) the adoration of his family and friends, he"s suspicious of strangers. The Puli is a strong-willed dog who will attempt to boss you around (nicely), sometimes without you even realizing it. His instinct is to protect and herd, which can sometimes extend to telling you when it"s time to go to bed or where to sit, or moving the kids from one room to another. The distinct Puli coat, which can take about four years to grow in and cord completely, comes in solid colors of rusty black, black, all shades of gray, and white. In Hungary, a common color is fako, which is described as the color of the inside of a whole-wheat roll. His corded coat makes the Puli look much larger than he really is. The width of the coat across the back can be three times wider than the actual dog. Underneath all that hair, the Puli weighs about 30 pounds and stands 16 to 17 inches tall. This unique coat requires a great deal of grooming to keep it clean and attractive, however. It is not a coat for beginners. In fact, even many professional groomers do not know how to properly care for a corded coat — not necessarily because they"re lacking skills, but because the average pet owner rarely keeps a dog in cords. If your heart is set on owning a Puli, you"ll need to learn how to maintain the coat on your own. Ask advice from a Puli breeder, or find someone well-versed in grooming a corded coat. Some owners elect to trim off the coat to make it easier to care for, though diehard Puli enthusiasts cringe at the thought of this: the cords are a vital part of the Puli identity, they say. While trimming the coat off is perfectly acceptable for a pet, the show Puli appears only with cords in most countries. He can be shown with cords or brushed out in the United States, however. The Puli isn"t born with his dreadlocks. Newborns are round puppies with a little crimp to their coats, which soon grows into fluff. The adult coat comes in at about one year of age, at which time the fluff is separated by hand into cords. This process of separating the cords continues for about three or four months until the cords are set. At maturity (about four years of age), the coat reaches the ground. Cords on the head fall over the face, veiling the eyes. Some owners tie up these cords to keep them out of the dog"s face. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is essential for the Puli to teach him proper canine manners. Keep in mind that the Puli is highly intelligent and independent — so he becomes bored with repetitive training. Keep lessons fresh, short, and fun to maintain his interest. Agility and herding are two activities perfectly suited to the breed"s natural instincts and playful, spirited nature. In fact, if you try your hand at herding competitions with your Puli, don"t be surprised to see Border Collie enthusiasts watching your dog in awe. While Border Collies were bred to handle smaller flocks of sheep, the Puli typically handles flocks of 400 or more, and he looks like a tornado as he whirls around the flock to keep it under control. An added benefit to participating in canine sports is that it helps you fulfill a basic Puli need: being the center of attention.
The Puli is vocal and tends to bark. The Puli loves his family but is suspicious of strangers. Because he"s a highly intelligent dog with a great deal of self-confidence, the Puli gets bored with repetitive tasks, such as obedience. Agility and herding are much more to his liking. The Puli can be a bit stubborn, so housetraining might be a challenge at first. Crate training is recommended. Pulik have a reputation for remaining puppyish well into their older years. They love to play and like to have a lot of toys. Grooming the Puli is difficult, especially if the coat is corded. New owners should seek help to learn how to properly groom their dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Puli is an ancient breed with a history that reaches back at least 2,000 years. Some believe a dog similar to the Puli existed 6,000 or more years ago; others believe the Puli derived more recently from the Tibetan Terrier. Around the turn of the century, crews excavating for oil in what is now known as Iraq — once home to the ancient civilization known as Sumeria — came across the grave of a man who had been buried with a medium-sized dog and a sheep. Among the artifacts in the grave, they found a long, coarse knot of hair that was almost white with age. The makeup of that hair was very much like that of today"s Puli. It"s believed that this man was a shepherd, buried with his favorite sheepdog and a sheep. There are indications that the Sumerians used Pulik or Puli-type dogs to herd sheep thousands of years ago. Clay plaques found in excavations of the town of Eridu reveal the Sumerian laws about animals. One of these has lines that refer to a Puli and a Komondor, another herding dog. Also in the same excavation site, an undamaged statuette of a Puli was found in the crypt of an eight-year-old girl. About 1,100 years ago, Magyar tribesmen brought Pulik to Hungary, where they became prized for their herding abilities. Many of the shepherds preferred black dogs because they were easier to see among the white flocks. It"s thought that the Puli was used to herd and drive the sheep, while the larger Komondor was used to guard the flocks. Back then, a good Puli cost as much as a shepherd"s full year of wages. As much as they valued their dogs, however, they were ruthless in culling those who weren"t as intelligent or weren"t able to perform their duties well. Many think that this culling is the reason why the Puli is such an intelligent and healthy breed today. By the 1800s, the Hungarian shepherds determined the very best characteristics of these small sheepdogs, and they tried to breed specifically to produce high-quality animals. In the late 1800s, the first description of the Puli was written — but by then the need for the sheepdog was diminishing, and so were his numbers. In 1912, Dr. Emil Raitsits, a professor at the Hungarian University of Veterinary Medicine, began a program to save the Puli from extinction. Adolf Lendl, the director of the Budapest Zoo, joined in the efforts. Together they remodeled part of the zoo for an experimental breeding program and exhibit. The program expanded, and they eventually named their kennel Allatkert. The foundation stock for many Hungarian kennels came from the Allatkert Kennel. In 1915, enthusiasts wrote the first breed standard for the Puli. In 1924, the Federation Cynologique Internationale (International Kennel Club) approved this standard. At first there were three categories of Puli: the ancestral (working) Puli with a shaggy coat; the luxury or show Puli; and the dwarf Puli. In 1935, four sizes of Pulik were recognized: the police Puli (19.7 inches high); the working or medium Puli (15.7 to 19.7 inches); the small Puli (11.8 to 15.7 inches); and the dwarf, miniature, or toy Puli (11 inches and under). The medium-sized Puli was the most popular. By this time, owning a Puli, a Komondor, or other native Hungarian breeds became a source of pride in Hungary. About the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture became interested in the Puli and, in 1935, imported four purebred Pulik to take part in herding dog tests conducted at the Department"s facility in Beltsville, Maryland. The Puli were said to have scored high marks on these tests, though the results were never published. At the outbreak of World War II, the tests were stopped and the Pulik were sold to professional breeders. The original four dogs and their progeny are thought to be the first Pulik in the United States. World War II was devastating to Hungary and also to dog breeders, particularly those in Europe. Food was scarce and there were no medical supplies. Kennels had to give their valuable breeding stock to people in other countries, and the Pulik who were left behind were often killed by bombs or shot by German or Russian soldiers. If the breed hadn"t been so popular before the war, it probably would be extinct now. Just as the Puli survived the harsh plains of Hungary, he beat the odds and, after the war, the number of Pulik in Hungary grew. In 1959, the Hungarian Puli Club created a Puli breed standard that eliminated the toy and police-size Pulik and included all of the remaining sizes in one category. By the 1960s, the number of Pulik in Hungary had reached prewar numbers. The Puli was accepted for American Kennel Club registration in 1936, and the Puli Club of America was formed in 1951.
Males are 17 inches tall and weigh 30 to 35 pounds. Females are 16 inches tall and weigh 25 to 30 pounds.
The unusual corded coat often draws the attention of those unfamiliar with the breed. But to those who know and love the Puli, it"s his personality that stands out. The Puli is fun-loving and affectionate, and he enjoys the company of his family. He"s also smart, hardworking, and athletic. Being suspicious of strangers, he makes a good watchdog. He"s also a strong-willed dog who requires a firm but kind owner. Don"t be surprised when he tries to "herd" you or your children. Many Pulik are vocal and like to bark. A "quiet" command should be part of early training. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Puli needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pulik are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pulik will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pulik, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Cataracts: These afflictions cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.
The Puli is a herding dog at heart, and he does best in a home with enough space for him to race off his natural energy. A large, fenced yard (make that a very tall fence) or a farm is ideal. He can adjust to smaller living spaces, but be prepared for his running laps around the dining room chairs and taking leaps over the couch. Exercise and playtime aside, bring the Puli indoors to live with you. He"s a loyal companion who enjoys being with people, and he shouldn"t be permanently relegated to the backyard. The agile Puli is a good candidate for many canine sports, especially herding tests, agility, and obedience competition (though obedience work can seem repetitive to the fun-loving Puli). If he"s not a working dog, he needs the mental and physical challenges available in dog sports. Otherwise he can become bored, which can lead to destructive behaviors such as barking, digging, and chewing. The Puli"s agility can get him in trouble, however. It"s been reported that Pulik can jump six-foot fences, so be sure your yard has a secure, high fence to keep him from escaping and injuring himself. Proper training and socialization are essential for the strong-willed Puli. He must learn good canine manners, and you must learn not to be bossed around by him. This dog is a leader, and he will lead you if you allow him to.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Puli in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Puli, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Puli coat is considered to be nonshedding and hypoallergenic. Most Pulik are black, though white and gray are also found in the United States. In Hungary, the most common color after black is the brownish fako (described as the color of a whole-wheat roll). Black coats are described as a "weathered" black, because some white hairs begin to grow in when the dog is about a year old. In addition, because the cords don"t shed, they lose some of their color intensity over time due to exposure to the sun and air. Some Puli coats are self-cording, though most are helped along by humans who separate the cords by hand when the adult coat comes in (at about one year of age). As the coat texture changes from puppy fluff to adult coat, the undercoat is packed into the interior of the outer coat tendril to form a felt-like structure. It takes about four years for the coat to become fully mature. Keep the fluffy, uncorded Puli coat in good condition through regular brushing and combing to remove tangles and dirt and to distribute natural skin oils. The corded coat is never brushed but managed by hand: first it"s dampened with water, then the cords are separated and twirled. The length of the corded coat is sometimes trimmed to keep it from collecting dust and dirt. Bathing a fluffy Puli coat is like bathing any other breed. Put the dog in the tub, add water and soap, and scrub. Dunking your corded-coat Puli in the tub, however, is a time-consuming task that takes a lot of hard work. First, the cords must be thoroughly soaked with water (this takes a while), and then you can work in some diluted shampoo. Rinsing can take up to 30 minutes. Following that, the cords are squeezed dry, first by hand and then with a towel. After a bath, some owners put a heavy sweatshirt on the Puli to continue soaking up the water. Air-drying the coat can take up s tend to shed less than those who live in warmer climates. You can avoid matting — and excess hair on your furniture — if you commit to brushing your dog"s coat at least once a week during the year — and daily during shedding season.Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and will take the time to clean themselves — much like a cat will. They don"t typically emit "doggy" odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the backyard or find a stinky body of water to jump in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural oils in your dog"s skin and coat.Huskies come in a variety of colors and markings, from black to pure white with colored markings on the body that include reds and coppers. Their eyes can be brown, blue, or a combination. Their faces sport masks that add to their eye appeal.Brush your Husky"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Husky to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Huskies make great pets for households with children. They can be very tolerant of children, but like all other dogs, should be supervised when around young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Siberian Huskies do get along with other dogs but it is still important to take your puppy to socialization classes. This gets them used to other dogs and also to people, although they are also very affectionate to strangers. Socialization teaches puppies how to behave and greet other dogs and their owners.Keep in mind the history of this breed. The harsh conditions in Siberia created a strong prey drive in this breed because food was often hard to find. As a result, many Huskies today maintain that prey drive toward small animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and cats. Some Huskies, however, thrive in multi-pet households, especially when they are raised with other pets from puppyhood.

If you ever see a Pyr Shep run an agility course, you"ll be astonished by the enthusiasm and speed of this lean but muscular little herding dog. His movement is said to "shave the earth," and indeed, it almost looks as if he"s flying. To live with a Pyrenean Shepherd is to take on a highly energetic, intelligent, mischievous companion whose passion for you will be matched only by his desire to work. Be prepared to stimulate his mind and fulfill his need for activity with a challenging dog sport or some kind of flock that he can take charge of. Ever vigilant, he tends to be distrustful of strangers and makes an excellent watchdog. You should give your Pyr Shep plenty of socialization, beginning in early puppyhood, to ensure that his lively personality develops to its fullest potential.

The merry and gentle Redbone Coonhound descends from red hounds brought to North America by Scottish and Irish immigrants during colonial times. The medium-size, solid-red dogs have the pleading expression common to hounds everywhere and a sweet voice that sings out when they"re on the hunt. Unfortunately, they also bark a lot at home, so make sure you live out in the country or have very tolerant neighbors. Friendly and loyal, Redbone Coonhounds make good companion dogs as long as they get plenty of exercise. Plan to be patient while training this breed; they often suffer from canine attention deficit disorder.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be an imposing dog with its strong, muscular body, intense stare, and powerful stance. Many are interested in the breed because it looks like a tough dog but are surprised to learn that the Stafford is a sensitive and loving companion who enjoys playing more than being tough. He sees life as a joyful adventure and lives it to the fullest. Fans love the Staffordshire Bull Terrier for his small to medium size, short, easy-care coat, and dynamic yet gentle personality. With his short, broad head and muscular body, he resembles the other bull breeds such as American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers, but he is a breed unto himself with distinct physical characteristics that set him apart, including size and ear shape. The Stafford is known for his love of people and trustworthy nature. He has been described as "a sort of everybody"s Man Friday," and his greatest desire is to spend time with his people, whether that means vegging out on the sofa and watching football, running errands in the car, going for walks, or participating in activities such as agility, flyball, obedience, and therapy work. Expect to give this athletic and energetic dog a vigorous walk every day, as well as plenty of attention during downtime. He dislikes being left to his own devices. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are not a breed that can be left outside alone or at home for long periods of time without human companionship. Nicknamed the nanny dog, the Stafford is prized for his patience with and love of children, although it goes without saying that no dog should ever be left alone with young children or expected to double as a baby-sitter. He is not always so friendly toward dogs he doesn"t know however, a remnant of his origin as a fighting breed, which required him to be aggressive toward other dogs yet gentle with human handlers. Be aware that some municipalities restrict the ownership of bull breeds. Be sure that yours is not one of them before acquiring a Stafford. For the person who has an understanding of his sensitive nature and can give him patient, firm leadership, the Stafford is one of the finest dog companions around.
The SBT should not be left to live outside. He"s a companion dog and thrives in the presence of his family. Because he may be aggressive toward unknown dogs, a Stafford should never be walked off leash. Staffords are highly intelligent, but they are also freethinkers who like to do things their own way. They need firm, patient, consistent training. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are energetic dogs who need a vigorous walk or play session daily. SBTs enjoy their comforts and will readily join you on the sofa or bed if allowed. Staffords shed little, although they may have a heavy shed once a year. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny. The Stafford needs early socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals. The SBT is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. Staffords love to chew, especially during puppyhood. Provide them with tough, durable toys. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers. Reinforce the bottom of fences with concrete or chicken wire so they can"t dig beneath them. Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well in apartments if they are properly exercised, but ideal living quarters include a fenced yard where they can play. Staffordshire Bull Terriers do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overheat. Staffords love children, but despite their nickname of "nanny dog," they should not double as a baby-sitter. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs. If properly socialized and raised with them, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Staffordshire Bull Terriers will never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a strong prey drive which will send them after small animals around your neighborhood including cats. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a high pain threshold and can become injured without any outward sign, such as whining. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a restricted or banned breed in many cities and the number of cities restricting the breed is rising. It is important to research your city"s dog by-laws to avoid the unnecessary seizure and destruction of your dog. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are extremely mouthy as puppies and can be destructive if not closely supervised. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are protective of family members, but they are not too concerned about property. They are more likely to welcome burglars than to guard the silver. Never buy a Stafford from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier shares a common ancestor — the Bulldog — with the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier, and the Bull Terrier. It was created in the early nineteenth century to be smaller and faster in the fighting ring, yet gentle and friendly toward people. It was probably developed by crossing the Bulldog with an ancestor of the Manchester Terrier. The cross eventually evolved into the Staffordshire Bull Terrier we see today. The first Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed in England in 1835, and a breed standard was written shortly thereafter. In the United States, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier generally enjoyed life as a family companion, and it wasn"t until 1975 that the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Stafford registered with the AKC was named Tinkinswood Imperial. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America was founded in 1974. Today, the Stafford is ranked 85th among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC. They are excellent dogs who truly embody the description "man"s best friend," and many enthusiasts know that they own one of the best kept secrets of the dog world.
Staffords stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder, with males being taller. Male Staffords weigh 28 to 38 pounds; females, 24 to 34 pounds.
Loving toward people from just a few weeks of age, a proper Stafford is never shy or snarly. He is energetic and enthusiastic in everything he does and remains on alert, even in repose. This breed"s temperament is described as tough, courageous, tenacious (read: stubborn), and curious. A people-loving personality makes him a good caretaker of his family, but he"s less likely to be protective of property. Because he"s so attentive and interested in people, however, he"ll always alert you to the presence of visitors, wanted or unwanted. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Stafford puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all SBTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In SBTs, you should expect to see health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems may occur in the breed: Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition that is thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Patellar Luxation: This common problem occurs when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and often slips out of place, causing the dog to skip or hop when it happens. It is thought to be hereditary. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts: The development of opacity or cloudiness in the lens of the eye at an early age. This condition progresses rapidly, and dogs can be blind by 3 years of age. Surgery can sometimes partially restore vision. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. L-2 Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria: Affected dogs lack a particular enzyme to break down the aforementioned compound. It then builds up in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, causing such signs as lack of coordination, muscle tremors, poor learning ability, and seizures. Signs can be treated, but there is no cure. Dogs with this condition are usually euthanized at an early age. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. Buy only from breeders who use this DNA test to screen their breeding animals. Skin Allergies: Also known as atopic dermatitis, this itchy, scratchy condition is sometimes seen in certain Staffords. It"s not unusual for afflicted dogs to suffer hair loss or to develop sore spots on their skin. The problem is often compounded by bacterial infections. Aggressive flea control treatment can help, as can supplementing the diet with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil. Demodectic Mange: All dogs carry demodex mites. The mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems, but dogs with weakened or compromised immune systems can develop a condition called demodectic mange. Also called demodicosis, it can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The good news is that the mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a companion dog who does well in any type of home as long as he gets daily exercise. He should live indoors, with access to a securely fenced yard. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers, so it is important to reinforce fences by embedding them in concrete or burying chicken wire at the bottom to prevent escapes. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Stafford will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight. His short face makes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier unsuited to staying outdoors for more than a few minutes in a hot or humid climate, and he should always have access to shade and fresh drinking water. Some Staffords enjoy playing in water and will appreciate having a kiddie pool to lounge in on hot days, but others prefer to avoid the wet stuff. Staffords are not good swimmers, so take steps to protect them from falling into a swimming pool or spa. The Stafford"s exercise requirements can be satisfied with two or three half-hour to one-hour walks or playtimes daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities. Begin training the day you bring your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he can be impulsive and stubborn. Forget strict and formal obedience training. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Stafford. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog"s self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Stafford is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself. A Stafford is not generally a barker, but he is definitely vocal. This breed will entertain you with his snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as his singing voice, often described as a yodel. If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Stafford. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your SBT puppy from chewing on things he shouldn"t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren"t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Stafford will be a strong puller, small size notwithstanding. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Stafford"s safety. Never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals. He has a strong prey drive and will give chase if not restrained. Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your SBT to be friendly toward other animals. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn"t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Stafford will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 2 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your SBT in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the skin. Itta-offset="300"class="gpt-ad js-inview">

Like the mythical Greek hero Hercules, the Rottweiler is strong and true with a loving heart. Affectionately called Rotties or Rotts, the breed originated in Germany, where it was used to drive cattle and pull carts for farmers and butchers. That heritage is reflected in the Rottie"s broad chest and heavily muscled body. When he moves, he displays strength and stamina, but when you look into his eyes you see warm, dark-brown pools reflecting a mellow, intelligent, alert, and fearless expression.A well-bred Rottweiler is calm and confident. He"s typically aloof toward strangers, but never timid or fearful. Rottweilers exhibit a "wait-and-see" attitude when confronted with new people and situations. When these characteristics come together as they should, the Rottweiler is a natural guard dog with a mellow disposition who is successful not only in police, military, and customs work, but also as a family friend and protector.Rotties have a natural instinct to protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense. It"s essential to channel their power and protectiveness by providing early socialization, firm, fair, consistent training and leadership, and a regular job to perform. When this doesn"t happen, Rottweilers can become dangerous bullies rather than the companionable guardians they"re meant to be.Rottweilers walk a fine line between protectiveness and aggressiveness. If they aren"t carefully bred for a calm, intelligent temperament and properly socialized and trained, they can become overly protective. That might sound like what you want, but a Rottie who lacks the ability to discriminate is dangerous to everyone he encounters, not just the bad guys.You must be able to provide your Rottweiler with leadership he can trust and respect without resorting to anger or physical force. Otherwise, he"ll take the role of top dog for himself. With a dog as powerful and intelligent as the Rottweiler, this is a recipe for disaster.Despite what you might have heard, Rottweilers are not temperamentally unsound or inherently vicious. Well-bred, well-socialized Rotties are playful, gentle, and loving to their families. They are easy to train if treated with respect and make great companions.As wonderful as Rottweilers can be, they aren"t the dog for everyone. You must not only be dedicated to training and socializing your Rottie, you must also deal with people who don"t understand the breed and pre-judge it. Because of bad or tragic experiences with Rottweilers or other large breeds, some cities have banned the breed. It"s unfair to judge an entire breed by the actions of a few, but it"s a reality you will have to deal with if you own a Rottweiler.You can do your part to redeem the reputation of the breed by training your Rottweiler to obey and respect people. Most important, don"t put your Rottie in the backyard and forget about him. This is a dog who is loyal to his people and wants to be with them. If you give him the guidance and structure he needs, you"ll be rewarded with one of the finest companions in the world.
Rottweilers are large, powerful dogs and require extensive socialization and training from early puppyhood. Even if you train and socialize your Rottweiler, expect to be subjected to sometimes unfair advance judgments about your dog, maybe even having untrue allegations made about him and his activities, by those who fear him. Because of the current prejudice against dogs such as Rottweilers and claims that they can be dangerous, you may have to carry extra liability insurance to own one, depending upon the ordinances in your town. In some areas, you may not even be able to own a Rottweiler, or may be forced to give up any that you have. Rottweilers love people and want to be with their families. If they are left alone for long periods of time or don"t receive adequate exercise, they may become destructive. If raised with children, well-bred Rottweilers get along fine with them. They must be taught, however, what is acceptable behavior with children. Rotties have a natural instinct to herd and may "bump" children to herd them. Because of their size, this "bump" may cause toddlers to fall down and injure themselves. In addition, some Rottweilers have a strong prey drive and may get overly excited when children run and play. Always supervise your Rottweiler when he"s around children. If you have an adult Rottweiler, introduce new animals, especially dogs, carefully. Rottweilers can be aggressive toward strange dogs, particularly those of the same sex. Under your leadership, however, your Rottie will probably learn to coexist peacefully with his new companion. Rottweilers are intelligent and are highly trainable if you"re firm and consistent. Rottweilers will test you to see if you really mean what you say. Be specific in what you ask, and don"t leave any loopholes for them to exploit. Rottweilers require a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks or playtimes daily. Rottweilers have a double coat and shed heavily in the spring and the fall, moderately throughout the rest of the year. Many Rottweilers snore. If their food intake is not monitored, Rotties have a tendency to overeat and can gain weight. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Rottweilers descend from the Molossus, a mastiff-type dog. Their ancestors marched to Germany with the Romans, driving the cattle that sustained them as they conquered the known world. As the army traveled, the big dogs mated with dogs that were native to the areas they passed through and laid the foundation for new breeds.One of the areas through which they passed was southern Germany, where the Romans set up colonies to take advantage of climate and soil, which were suitable for agriculture. They built villas roofed with red tile. More than 600 years later, as they were building a new church, inhabitants of the town excavated the site of the ancient Roman baths and uncovered one of the red-tiled villas. The discovery inspired a new name for the town: das Rote Wil (the red tile).Over the centuries, Rottweilers flourished as a market area for cattle, the German equivalent of a Texas cowtown, and the descendants of the Roman Molossus dogs drove the cattle to town for butchering. To keep their money safe from thieves after selling their livestock, the cattlemen put their filled purses around their Rottweiler"s neck when they returned home. Butchers in the area also used the dogs to pull carts loaded with meat.Eventually, rail transport replaced cattle drives. The Rottweiler nearly became extinct. At a dog show in Heilbronn, Germany, in 1882, only one nondescript Rottweiler was exhibited. That situation began to change in 1901, when the Rottweiler and Leonberger Club was founded and the first Rottweiler breed standard was written. The description of the Rottweiler"s appearance and character has changed little since then.Rottweilers began to be used in police work, for which they were well suited. Several Rottweiler breed clubs were formed over the years, but the one with staying power was the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK), founded in 1921. The ADRK survived World War II and has continued to promote good breeding programs in Germany and throughout the world. It"s dedicated to preserving the working ability of the Rottweiler.It"s thought that the first Rottweiler came to the U.S. with a German emigrant in the late 1920s. The first litter was whelped in 1930, and the first dog registered by the American Kennel Club was Stina v Felsenmeer in 1931.After World War II, the breed started becoming more popular. At that time, it was primarily known as an excellent obedience dog. The height of the Rottweiler"s popularity was in the mid-1990s when more than 100,000 were registered with the American Kennel Club.Being popular isn"t necessarily a good thing when you"re a dog. It"s not unusual for irresponsible breeders and puppy mills to try to cash in on the popularity of a breed and start producing puppies without regard for health and temperament problems. This is what happened to the Rottweiler breed until bad publicity and the demand for them decreased.Dedicated, reputable breeders are taking this chance to turn the breed around and ensure that Rottweilers are the type of dogs they were meant to be. Today, Rottweilers rank 17th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Males typically are 24 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 95 to 130 pounds. Females typically are 22 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 85 to 115 pounds.
The ideal Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous, never shy. He has a self-assured aloofness and doesn"t make friends with people immediately or indiscriminately. Instead, he takes a wait-and-see attitude with new people or situations. With his family, he"s affectionate, often following them around the house. This is not a highly excitable dog. He has an inherent desire to protect his family and property, but should never be aggressive toward people without cause. The Rottweiler is smart and adaptable with a strong work ethic.You"ll see some differences between the sexes. Males are quiet but watchful, constantly assessing their surroundings for threats. Females are somewhat easier to control and may be more affectionate. Both are highly trainable but can be stubborn.Rottweilers require firm, consistent but not harsh discipline. A sharp word is often a sufficient reprimand, but only if you"ve clearly established your leadership. If not, he may try to bully or bluff you. This is not a dog for people who lack assertiveness or don"t have time to devote to training and supervision. Earning a Rottweiler"s respect involves setting boundaries and teaching consequences for inappropriate behavior, both of which take time and patience.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Rotties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Rottweiler puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Rottweilers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Rotties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Rotties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dyplasia: Elbow dysplasia is a hereditary malformation of the elbow joint. The severity of the dysplasia can only be determined by x-rays. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain. Aortic Stenosis/Sub-aortic Stenosis (AS/SAS): This common heart defect is sometimes seen in Rottweilers. The aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It"s an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn"t known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Gastric Dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like Rottweilers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeder and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Panosteitis (Pano): This is sometimes referred to as "growing pains" because it usually occurs in puppies when they are around four months old. The primary symptom is lameness. Often, rest will be all that is needed, but if your puppy starts limping, it"s a good idea to have your vet check him. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.
It"s important for Rottweilers to live in the home with their people. If they"re left alone in a backyard all the time, they can become bored, destructive, and aggressive. Although they"re large, Rottweilers are inactive indoors.A Rottweiler is a homebody, but he requires a fenced yard not only to protect him from traffic but also because he can be aggressive toward other dogs and strangers who come onto his property. An underground electronic fence can"t keep your Rottie in your yard if he really wants to get out. More important, it doesn"t prevent people or other animals from coming onto your property. Put up a sign advising strangers and non-family members not to come onto your property without your escort.The Rottweiler"s energy level ranges from couch potato to whirlwind. Be sure to tell the breeder what kind of energy level suits you so she can help you choose the best puppy for your lifestyle. Moderately active Rottweilers will appreciate a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks each day. They also enjoy playing with balls and going hiking. More energetic Rotties may need longer exercise times and more structured activities. Their athleticism, intelligence, and trainability make them well suited to agility and obedience competition, as well as tracking, therapy work, and their traditional job, pulling a cart or wagon. Perfect for parades!When training your Rottweiler, keep in mind that he thrives on mental stimulation. He likes to learn new things and is eager to please you. He might be willful at times, with a "Show me why I should do this" attitude. Be fair, consistent, and firm, and your Rottweiler will reward you with his quick ability to learn.Your Rottweiler shouldn"t be difficult to housetrain given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 10 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Rottweiler in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Rottie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Rottweilers have a short double coat that"s straight and coarse. The outer coat is medium in length, shorter on the head, ears, and legs; the undercoat is found mainly on the neck and thighs. The amount of undercoat your Rottie has depends on the climate in which he lives.The Rottweiler is always black with markings that are rust to mahogany in color. The markings appear over the eyes, on the cheeks, on each side of the muzzle, on the chest and legs, and beneath the tail. There are also tan lines that resemble pencil marks on the toes.Brush your Rottie weekly with a firm bristle brush to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. He"ll shed twice a year, and you"ll probably want to brush more frequently during that time to keep the loose hair under control. Bathe him as needed. If you bathe him outdoors, it should be warm enough that you"re comfortable without wearing long sleeves or a coat. If you aren"t, it"s too cold to be giving your Rottie a bath out there.Brush your Rottie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin accustoming your Rottweiler to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Rottweilers typically like children, especially if they"re raised with them. When around children, especially young ones, they should be supervised because they are so big and strong. Because of their cattle-driving heritage, they have a tendency to lean and push and can accidentally topple a toddler with a nudge.They"re probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. It"s also important to supervise your Rottweiler any time your children have friends over. Rotties can be perturbed by loud or rough play between kids and may take steps to put a stop to it, not understanding that "his" children aren"t in danger. They may also chase young children who are running.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.When Rottweilers are raised with other dogs and cats, they generally get along well with them. They may have issues with strange dogs or adult dogs that are introduced into the home, being intolerant of same-sex dogs. With your training and guidance, however, they should accept new animals peaceably. Keep your Rottie on leash in public to prevent aggression or belligerence toward other dogs. The Rottie is not the best candidate for visiting off-leash dog parks.
