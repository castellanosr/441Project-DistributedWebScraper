The German Pinscher has the energy and drive of all working breeds, but he"s also an outstanding companion. He loves being with his family and will meld himself into every facet of your life. The German Pinscher"s playfulness will continue well into adulthood, and he may continue to disembowel squeaky toys long past teething (dental floss is the best repair tool). When German Pinchers are in a spot of trouble at home, some will look you right in the eye and smile, showing their teeth in a big grin. The German Pinscher was originally developed as a working dog who hunted and killed vermin (that means he"ll still nail them today, so he"s not going to be good in a home with pet rodents). Today, he still has the energy of a working breed and has proved himself to be an all-around kind of guy when it comes to canine sports and careers. You can find German Pinschers in the conformation ring, at obedience rallies or agility trials, and at work in tracking. He also works as a service dog, therapy dog, and as a pampered pet who enjoys the comforts of family life. He can be assertive and overbearing, and he"ll take over your heart and home in a matter of seconds. Don"t kid yourself: he needs a firm, experienced owner who is consistent in training and good at establishing rules right from the beginning. If you tend to wimp out or you want a placid dog, find another breed — this one will walk all over you. However, he will also be completely, utterly, and permanently devoted to you. This devotion supports his ability to be an excellent guard dog. Despite an independent streak, he likes to be in the middle of all family activities, right there with you. The German Pinscher will alert bark with a strong voice. If any intruder risks entering your home, this dog will defend it with everything he"s got. And he"s quite capable of taking care of an intruder: While he"s not the largest guard dog around, maxing out at about 45 pounds, he"s incredibly skillful at the job. Given that he looks like a small Doberman Pinscher or a humongous Miniature Pinscher (he was a foundation dog for both of those breeds), and that he"s suspicious of strangers, he can make some people nervous. He will accept your friends without problems; it"s the folks you don"t know who might hear that strong voice he"s famous for, the one that sounds like it"s coming from a much bigger dog. He saves that voice for special occasions. A German Pinscher is intelligent and quick to learn, and he can reach all levels of training and competition. He also has a personality that will test limits (both his own and yours). Apartments make adequate homes if you properly exercise your German Pinscher, but it isn"t his ideal situation. He does better with a yard to run in--a properly fenced yard, to prevent any escape-artist tendencies. He has a strong prey drive and will chase any animal deemed interesting (unfortunately, you are not the one doing the deeming). He must be trained — start him at a young age. Since he"s so intelligent, the task isn"t difficult, even though he isn"t as eager to please you as are some breeds; he really needs a firm and consistent owner. Use positive reinforcement and establish consistent rules, because German Pinschers are known for their strong temperament — given half a chance, he"ll take control of the house. But if you take the time and effort, the end result of training the German Pinscher is worth all the time it takes. For one thing, you don"t want to end up living with a strong, wary, protective dog who"s out of control; for another, it"s highly satisfying to train such a smart and capable canine. Socialization is just as important as obedience training for the German Pinscher, and it helps avoid aggressiveness. As a puppy he should be socialized to other dogs, puppies, adults, and children. Most obedience schools offer socialization classes, and he can also run errands with you, take long walks, go to the dog park, and have playdates with canine friends and two-legged children. Although a German Pinscher is a loving family companion, he"s not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine because of his strong and assertive nature. This can be overpowering even to some adults, but especially to a child. However, if he"s the dog for you, then there"s no denying that the happy, loving, intelligent German Pinscher will make your family, life, and home complete.
The German Pinscher is not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine. A working breed, he needs daily exercise and cannot be left untrained or unexercised. Expect a healthy amount of exercise each day to curb negative behaviors. The German Pinscher can fare all right in an apartment as long as he"s walked at least twice a day. However, he"s better suited to a home that has a fenced yard. He has a strong prey drive and will chase anything that he deems worth chasing. He should be kept on lead while not in a secured area, and fences should be secure enough that he can"t slip through them. The German Pinscher is a strong-willed breed that needs a consistent and firm owner. He has been known to take over a home if rules are not set when he"s young. With training and consistency, however, the German Pinscher will learn quickly and well. Naturally suspicious of strangers, the German Pinschers makes an excellent guard dog. By the same token, he needs to be socialized from a young age to prevent the development of aggressive behavior. The German Pinscher enjoys jumping up to greet loved ones, but proper training can correct this trait. He will alert bark and he has a strong, loud voice, but he won"t bark unnecessarily. He thrives when he"s part of a family and can participate in family activities. He isn"t a breed who can live outside, and he"s unhappy being forgotten while life is busy. The German Pinscher can become destructive when he"s bored. He"s also known for his ability to gut toys at an alarming rate. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Originally developed to eradicate vermin, the German Pinscher originated in Germany somewhere between the late 1700s and late 1800s. There is no clear evidence of when he was developed, but a painting that dates from about 1780 portrays a dog similar in appearance to the German Pinscher. He was a foundation dog for many breeds, including the Doberman Pinscher and the Miniature Pinscher. The breed was founded by the Rat Pinscher, also known as the Rat Catcher or the Great Ratter, a breed that became extinct in the early 1800s. The German Pinscher was recognized as a breed in 1895. During the World Wars, the German Pinscher came close to extinction. Two breed colors did in fact die out: the pure black and the salt-and-pepper. After World War II, a West German named Werner Jung began breeding German Pinschers and saved the breed. German Pinschers were first imported into the United States in the late 1970s.
The German Pinscher is a squarely built, muscular, medium-sized dog. The average height is between 17 to 20 inches for both males and females. They usually weigh between 25 and 45 pounds.
The German Pinscher is strong-willed, devoted, and in need of a consistent and firm owner. He can take over a home if rules are not set when he"s young. With training and consistency, German Pinschers will learn quickly. Naturally suspicious of strangers, he is an excellent guard dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the German Pinscher needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Pinscher puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. He"s like a mischievous kid who will test your boundaries. Sure, he"ll housetrain quickly, and he"s quite trainable in other respects as well, but he wants to know what he can get away with. You need mental and physical strength to control a German Pinscher and gain his respect. He must have a strong leader whose authority is tempered with patience and respect. If you aren"t a calm person or are unable to say no and truly mean it, or you"re not really interested in taking on in-depth training, look elsewhere.
German Pinschers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all German Pinschers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In German Pinschers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.
German Pinschers are active and need daily exercise either through a good run in the backyard or two long walks on lead. Supervise your German Pinscher when exercising, since he"ll go bounding off after anything that"s worth chasing. He"ll be all right in an apartment if given enough exercise, but he prefers a home with a fenced yard in which he can play. He isn"t suited to living outdoors full-time in a kennel or dog run, however; he thrives being with his family. He"s a working breed and enjoys having a job to do. An unstimulated, untrained, and unexercised German Pinscher can head down a scary path of boredom and destruction. Give him something to work on while you"re gone, such as interactive toys or Kongs with frozen peanut butter. He"s no couch potato, content to lounge about all day enjoying bonbons. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your German Pinscher doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. Like many other dogs, a German Pinscher can be destructive as a pup, and when even when he enters adulthood. Crate training is for his own safety. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Pinscher accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Pinscher in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. He isn"t meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel. Exercise, training, and laying down house rules for your German Pinscher all will help ensure that your companion is well behaved. It alleviates stress for you and him and provides opportunities to bond.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Pinscher in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your German Pinscher, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The coat should be shiny and smooth in texture, short and dense with no bald spots. The German Pinscher sports a variety of colors, including various shades of red, stag red (in which there are black hairs intermingled with the red), and Isabella (a light bay or fawn color). German Pinschers can also be black or blue with tan or red markings. The German Pinscher is an average shedder and requires minimal grooming. Brushing his coat with a cloth or rubber mitt about once a week will get rid of any excess hair. Brush your German Pinscher"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your German Pinscher to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The German Pinscher usually does well with children if he"s brought up with them from puppyhood. But because of his assertive nature, he does best with older children, preferably those over the age of nine. An older Pinscher who"s unfamiliar with children will probably do best in a home with kids who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should be left unsupervised with a child. The same holds true for the German Pinscher"s attitude toward some kinds of pets; he does best if he"s been raised with them, or at least socialized to them when he"s still young. But remember that he was developed to hunt and kill vermin. He"s got a high prey drive that"s hardwired, and no amount of training will keep him from going after a pet rat. He"s not a good match with small mammals.
German Pinschers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Pinschers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a German Pinscher rescue. German Pinscher Club Rescue

The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian in Great Britain and parts of Europe, is among the top 10 most popular dog breeds in the U.S., and probably one of the world"s most recognized breeds.He owes part of his renown to a small puppy who was plucked from a bullet- and bomb-riddled breeding kennel in France during World War I by Corporal Lee Duncan. At the end of the war Duncan brought the puppy back to his hometown of Los Angeles, trained him, and turned him into one of the most famous dogs in show biz: Rin Tin Tin. Rin Tin Tin went on to appear in dozens of movies and, at the height of his stardom, got 10,000 fan letters a week.The German Shepherd has held many jobs other than movie star: leading the blind, chasing down criminals, sniffing out illegal substances, serving in the military, visiting the sick, and herding stock are just some of the jobs held by this versatile breed.The dog has even taken on the role of national hero. German Shepherds were the search and rescue dogs crawling through the ruins of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, looking for survivors and comforting rescue workers and families.The German Shepherd may embody some of the best traits of dogs, but he"s not for everyone. Originally bred to herd flocks all day, this is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of activity and exercise. Without it, he"s likely to express his boredom and frustration in ways you don"t like, such as barking and chewing.The breed also has an aloof and sometimes suspicious nature — great for a watchdog but not the sort of family dog who"ll make guests feel welcome. But if you expose a German Shepherd to many different situations and people starting in puppyhood, he can learn to take new people and circumstances in stride.If you"re buying a puppy, you"ll get a slightly different kind of German Shepherd depending on whether you choose an American versus a German breeder. In general, American breeders are often aiming to create dog show champions, and they breed puppies more for that distinctive German Shepherd look than for those distinctive German Shepherd talents.Fans say that American-bred German Shepherds are calmer than their German counterparts, but critics say these dogs have lost some of their talents for working traditional German Shepherd jobs, and are more prone to behavior problems such as separation anxiety.German breeders, on the other hand, breed German Shepherds for their working abilities as well as to fit the breed"s traditional look. Before a German Shepherd is bred in Germany, he has to pass numerous tests to prove he measures up to the physical and mental benchmarks the breed is known for. German Shepherd Dogs from Germany tend to have a more energetic and driven personality.
German Shepherds isn"t the breed for you if you"re away from home frequently or for long periods of time. When left alone they can become anxious or bored, and are likely to express their worry in ways you don"t like — barking, chewing, and digging. The German Shepherd is an active and intelligent dog. He must be kept busy learning, playing, and working. Daily exercise, both physical (such as jogging and Frisbee) and mental (such as training sessions), is a must. German Shepherds can be aloof and suspicious of strangers. To raise a social and well-behaved dog, expose your German Shepherd puppy to many experiences, places, and people. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is important for getting him used to other people and dogs, as well as teaching him basic canine manners. These dogs shed, shed, shed — in fact, their nickname is the "German shedder." Brush him several times a week and buy a good vacuum. You"ll need it. Crate training is not only a wonderful way to housetrain a puppy, it helps teach him to be calm and happy when separated from his owner. This is especially important for the German Shepherd, who sometimes suffers separation anxiety, or extreme anxiety when left alone. He"s got a reputation for being a great watchdog — and he is — but the German Shepherd should never be chained or tethered just to stand guard. No dog should; it leads to frustration and aggression. The German Shepherd is happiest living indoors with the family, but with access to a large, fenced yard, where he can burn off some of his natural energy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed, dating back to 1899, and he owes his existence to one man: Captain Max von Stephanitz, a career captain in the German cavalry with a goal of creating a German breed that would be unmatched as a herding dog.Centuries before von Stephanitz came along, farmers in Germany, as in the rest of Europe, relied on dogs to drive and protect their herds. Some dogs were legendary for their skill, and sheepherders would travel days to breed their female dogs to a notable sire. However, as von Stephanitz noted, no one had developed the herding dogs of the region into a distinct breed.In 1898, von Stephanitz retired from military life and began his second career, and what would prove to be his passion: experimenting with dog breeding to create a superior German herding dog. Stephanitz studied the breeding techniques of the British, noted for their exceptional herding dogs, and traveled throughout Germany, attending dog shows and observing German-type herding dogs.Von Stephanitz saw many fine herding dogs, dogs who were athletic, or intelligent, or capable. What he didn"t see was a dog who embodied all those traits.One day, in 1899, von Stephanitz was visiting a dog show when a wolfish-looking dog caught his eye. He immediately bought the dog, named Hektor Linksrhein. Later renamed Horand v Grafeth, the dog"s powerful physique and intelligence so impressed von Stephanitz that he formed a society — the Verein fur deutsche Schaferhunde — to found a breed out of Horand"s descendents.Although he had intended for his breed to work as herding dogs, as Germany became more and more industrialized, von Stephanitz saw the need for such dogs fading. He was determined that his breed would continue as a working dog, and he decided that the dog"s future was in police work and military service.Making good use of his military connections, von Stephanitz convinced the German government to use the breed. During World War I the German Shepherd served as a Red Cross dog, messenger, rescuer, guard, supply carrier, and sentry.Although German Shepherds made their way to the United States before the war, it wasn"t until the war that the breed became popular in the U.S. Allied servicemen noted the dog"s bravery and intelligence, and a number of dogs went home with these soldiers.One such dog was a five-day-old puppy plucked from a bomb-riddled kennel in France by an American corporal from Los Angeles. The corporal took the puppy home, trained him, and turned him into one of Hollywood"s most recognizable four-legged stars: Rin Tin Tin, who appeared in 26 movies and helped popularize the breed in America.Although the Allies were impressed by the German dogs, they weren"t so happy with the dog"s German roots. During wartime all things German were stigmatized, and in 1917, the American Kennel Club (AKC) changed the breed"s name to the Shepherd Dog.In England, the dog was renamed the Alsatian Wolf Dog, after the German-French border area of Alsace-Lorraine. The AKC went back to using the original name of German Shepherd Dog in 1931; it took until 1977 for the British Kennel Club to do the same.Von Stephanitz stayed closely involved with the development of the breed, and as early as 1922, he became alarmed by some of the traits that were turning up in the dogs, such as poor temperament and a tendency to tooth decay. He developed a system of tight quality control: Before any individual German Shepherd was bred, he needed to pass numerous tests of his intelligence, temperament, athleticism, and good health.American breeding of German Shepherds, on the other hand, wasn"t nearly so regulated. In the United States, the dogs were bred to win dog shows, and breeders put more emphasis on looks and on the dogs" gait, or way of moving.After World War II, American- and German-bred German Shepherds began to diverge dramatically. At one point, the U.S. police departments and military began importing German Shepherd working dogs, because homegrown German Shepherds were failing performance tests and plagued by genetic health conditions.In the past few decades, some American breeders have begun to put the emphasis back on the breed"s abilities rather than just appearance, importing working dogs from Germany to add to their breeding program. It"s now possible to buy American-bred German Shepherds that live up to the breed"s reputation as a capable working dog.
Males stand 24 to 26 inches; females stand 22 to 24 inches. Weight ranges from 75 to 95 pounds.
The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. He"s a reserved dog; he doesn"t make friends immediately, but once he does, he"s extremely loyal. With his family he"s easy-going and approachable, but when threatened he can be strong and protective, making him an excellent watchdog.This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do — any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim.One thing he"s not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship he needs — as well as exercise and the chance to put his intelligence to work — he becomes bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who"s under-exercised and ignored by his family is likely to express his pent-up energy in ways you don"t like, such as barking and chewing.Like every dog, the German Shepherd needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
German Shepherds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all German Shepherds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In German Shepherds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Degenerative Myelopathy: Degenerative myelopathy is a progressive disease of the spinal cord, specifically the part of the cord that communicates information to the brain regarding the hind legs. Dogs with DM act as though they don"t know where their back legs are, and cannot move them properly. The disease progresses to the point the dog cannot walk. Most of the time, there is no treatment and the dog is put to sleep. However, in a few rare cases, the condition is related to a lack of vitamin-12 or vitamin E. If this is the case, vitamin supplements might stabilize the condition.Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: EPI is a genetic disease of the pancreas in which the cells that produce digestive enzymes are destroyed. As a result, the dog can no longer digest and absorb food. The first signs of the condition are gas, loss of appetite, weight loss, and change in stools. The dog becomes very thin, and very hungry. EPI is diagnosed with a simple blood test, and treatment is simple, too: pancreatic enzymes are added to the dog"s food. With proper medication supervision, most dogs recover.Allergies: Some German Shepherds suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. Allergy symptoms in dogs are similar to those in people. If your German Shepherd is scratching, licking at his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect that it has an allergy and have him checked by your vet.
Originally bred to herd flocks all day, German Shepherds are built for action. This means he"s got lots of energy that he needs to burn off with daily exercise.If you leave him alone for long periods of time without exercise, expect trouble. Boredom and inactivity lead to behavior problems — chewing, digging, and barking. The German Shepherd desperately needs to exercise both his body (jogging, a romp at the dog park) and his mind (training exercises like agility or obedience competitions).Like many herding breeds, German Shepherds are barkers. Barking isn"t necessarily a problem, but it can be if the dog is bored. Learning the "Quiet" command should be part of every German Shepherd"s obedience training.German Shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. If they pick the wrong thing to gnaw on, they can damage their teeth, swallow something that makes them sick, or even choke. Save your dog, and your belongings, by giving him safe chew toys and bones so he can entertain himself when you"re not playing with him.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.If your dog starts to put on weight, cut back; if he looks too thin, add a little more. You can determine whether your German Shepherd is overweight by using the hands-on test. Place your hands on him, thumbs along the spine and fingers going down the sides. You should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle. If you can see the ribs, he"s too thin. If they"re undetectable beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet.You"ll need to take special care with feeding and exercising a German Shepherd puppy, however. German Shepherds grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet (22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat) that keeps them from growing too fast.And don"t let your German puppy run, jump, or play on hard surfaces like pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. It"s fine for puppies to play on grass, though, and puppy agility, with its inch-high jumps, is okay.Overfeeding your German Shepherd and letting him pack on the pounds can cause joint problems, as well as other health conditions. Limit treats, keep him active, and serve him regular meals rather than leaving food available at all times.For more on feeding your German Shepherd, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The German Shepherd was originally bred to herd flocks in harsh climates, and his medium-length double coat fits the job perfectly, protecting the dog from rain and snow, and resistant to picking up burrs and dirt.The coat types of the German Shepherd are as varied as his color; some German Shepherds are longhaired. However, the ideal German Shepherd has a double coat of medium length. The outer coat is dense with straight hair that lies close to the body, and is sometimes wavy and wiry.The coat comes in variety of colors and patterns including black; black and cream; black and red; black and silver; black and tan; blue; gray; liver; sable; and white. The American Kennel Club doesn"t recognize white as a color for this breed, however, and won"t let white German Shepherds compete in conformation shows, although they"re allowed in other competitions.Sometimes jokingly called "German shedders," the breed sheds year-round, and generally "blows" — sheds a lot of hair at once, like a snowstorm — twice a year. If you want a German Shepherd, be prepared for hair on your black pants, on your white couch, and pretty much all over the house.There"s no magic solution to shedding. Accept it. However, brushing two to three times a week will help more of the hair come out in a brush, rather than on your furnishings. And a sturdy vacuum cleaner doesn"t hurt either.Bathing the dog too often strips the coat of oils that keep it healthy, so start running the bathwater only if your dog really needs it. It shouldn"t be that often; despite his notoriety as a shedder, the German Shepherd tends to be fairly clean and odorless.The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.German Shepherds love to chew, and the habit helps keep their teeth clean. Give them sturdy, safe dental chew toys or bones, and they"ll be fighting tartar buildup as they gnaw, especially on the back molars. Brushing their teeth with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste also helps keep gums and teeth in good shape.
If he"s well trained and has had plenty of exposure to kids, especially as a puppy, a German Shepherd is a great companion for children. In fact, some say he"s a cross between a babysitter and a cop, both gentle with, and protective of, the children in his family.This is a big dog, though, capable of mistakenly bumping a toddler or small child. True to his reserved nature, he"s not tail-wagging friendly with kids he doesn"t know, but he"s generally trustworthy.The German Shepherd can also live peacefully with other dogs and pets, as long as he was taught to do so from puppyhood. Introducing an adult German Shepherd to a household with other pets can be more difficult if the dog isn"t used to getting along with other dogs or cats. You may need to hire a professional trainer to help, or get advice from the rescue organization if that"s where you acquired the adult German Shepherd.
German Shepherds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Shepherds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a German Shepherd rescue.

One of the most versatile sporting breeds around, the stylish and regal German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP for short) is a superb hunting dog who also excels as a family companion. He hunts feathered and furred game and will even trail deer. In the evening, he plays with the kids or curls up next to you on the sofa. Not a hunter? The German Shorthair will be happy to hike or jog with you. Slightly smaller than a Pointer, the GSP has an elegantly chiseled head with dark almond-shaped eyes, an intelligent, good-humored expression, and a large, dark nose. Broad, dropped ears are set high and lie flat against the head. But the most striking aspect of the GSP"s appearance is his short, dense, sleek coat of solid liver or liver and white, which can be patched, ticked or roan. The tail is usually docked, leaving about 40 percent of the original length. This energetic, intelligent dog is enthusiastic at work and play. He likes being with people and is a good friend to children, albeit a bit rambunctious for little ones. That people-loving personality causes the GSP to be unhappy if left alone for long periods, and he can become nervous and destructive if he"s not provided with regular companionship and exercise. He"ll bark at strangers but isn"t aggressive. Males tend to be more outgoing and are more aggressive hunters than females. The muscular GSP needs a great deal of exercise. Expect to give him a workout of an hour or two daily. With his webbed feet and water-resistant coat, he"s a great water dog and loves to swim. If you have a pool, expect him to be in it with you. GSPs like to please their people and will work hard for them, especially if they"re rewarded with praise, play, or food. They typically aren"t stubborn and learn new exercises quickly. The biggest challenge is to keep them focused on training. They can get bored easily. This is one of the few hunting breeds that can perform virtually all gundog roles. The GSP can be a pointer and a retriever. He can hunt upland birds and waterfowl, as well as rabbits, raccoons, and deer. Whatever you ask of your GSP, he will gladly comply with unshakable reliability.
German Shorthaired Pointers are high-energy dogs. At least an hour of intensive exercise, preferably off-leash, each day is recommended. Without sufficient exercise, your GSP may become nervous and destructive. GSPs are people-oriented and don"t like to be left alone for long periods of time without something to keep them busy. Since they are so intelligent, they will find something to keep them busy if you don"t — usually getting into something that you don"t want them to get into. Bored German Shorthaired Pointers can become escape artists, so you need at least a six-foot tall fence if you plan to leave them alone outside. GSPs bark at strangers and noises. They also are a bit reserved with strangers. Female GSPs typically are very protective of their puppies if they have a litter. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Early versions of this type of dog date to the 17th century, but German Shorthaired Pointers as we know them today were created to be multipurpose hunting dogs in the mid- to late nineteenth century. The forerunner to the GSP, the German Pointer or German Bird Dog, was a product of crosses between Spanish Pointers and Bloodhounds, resulting in big houndlike dog with a keen nose. Hunters selected for dogs with biddable personalities, but they came to want style and elegance to go along with that obedient nature and powerful scenting ability. They used Pointers imported from England to add style, and they created a dog that would work as well in water as on land. Prince Albrecht zu Solms-Braunfeld of the Royal House of Hanover was credited with encouraging breeders to select early specimens on the basis of function rather than form. The result was a lean, athletic, and responsive all-around hunting dog who is also an intelligent and affectionate companion dog. The first known German Shorthair in the United States was imported in 1925 by Dr. Charles Thornton of Montana, who began breeding the dogs. Only five years later, the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first German Shorthair registered with the AKC was Greif v.d. Fliegerhalde. World War II affected the breeding of German Shorthaired Pointers. As the end of the war drew near, many breeders hid their gold, their diamonds, their artwork, their Lipizzaner stallions, and their German Shorthaired Pointers. The very best dogs were sent to Yugoslavia for safekeeping. But since Yugoslavia was behind the Iron Curtain after WW II, West German breeders didn"t have access to Germany"s finest GSPs and they were faced with rebuilding their beloved breed from a limited gene pool. Meanwhile, in the U.S., GSPs were progressing by leaps and bounds. The 1950s were a time of significant advancement for the GSP in the United States, but many believe 1968 was the zenith for the German Shorthaired Pointer in the U.S. That was the year that three of the top four finishers at the AKC National Field Trial Championship already had their conformation championships. In addition to their hunting abilities, GSPs have inspired modern-day writers to immortalize the breed in their works. One such writer is Robert B. Parker, whose popular mystery series is about a Boston detective named Spenser. Throughout the series, Spenser has three solid-liver German Shorthair Pointers, all named Pearl. Parker often appears on the dustjackets of his Spenser books with a solid-liver GSP. Rick Bass wrote a book called Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had about living and hunting with a German Shorthair in Montana Sportswriter Mel Wallis wrote a book titled Run, Rainey, Run about his relationship with his intelligent and versatile hunting German Shorthaired Pointer. Today, the German Shorthaired Pointer ranks 19th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males are 23 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 70 pounds. Females are 21 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
Smart, friendly, and willing, the GSP is enthusiastic in everything he does without being nervous or flighty. He doesn"t like being left alone, however, and can develop separation anxiety. This is a house dog, not a yard or kennel dog. He"ll love everyone in the family but may choose a special favorite. He"s highly trainable. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, GSPs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your GSP puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.    
German Shorthairs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all GSPs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In GSPs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. In mild cases, with proper diet and exercise the animal can lead a full and active life. In more severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Your veterinarian can x-ray your dog"s hips for evaluation. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Cancer: This was one of the most reported health problems in a recent survey by the German Shorthaired Pointer Club of America. The types of cancers most often reported were mammary tumors, mast cell tumors, and lymphosarcoma. Lymphedema: A disorder in which valvular blockage of lymph flow or twisted lymphatic ducts cause tissues to swell from an accumulation of fluids. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your German Shorthair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like GSPs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food given might be factors in causing this to happen too. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively, and retches without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.
GSPs aren"t recommended for apartment dwellers. They are best suited to active people who have a home with a large yard surrounded by a high fence. German Shorthaired Pointers were bred to have energy and stamina to last all day in the field, so exercise is important for them. If they don"t get enough exercise, they can become nervous and destructive. Expect to exercise them an hour or more each day. Your GSP will enjoy a strenuous hike, long walk, or a good game of fetch. Given enough exercise, GSPs make excellent house dogs. Because they are so curious and intelligent, it"s a good idea to crate young GSPs when you aren"t around to supervise so they don"t get into mischief. GSPs work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often requires them to work well away from the hunter — they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The GSP who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Shorthair in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your GSP, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The GSP has a short, thick, water-repellent coat that"s slightly longer on the underside of the tail and the back edges of the rear end, known as the haunches. On the head, the hair is softer, thinner, and shorter. The distinctive coat is solid liver or a combination of liver and white. It can be ticked (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), patched, or roaned (a fine mixture of colored hairs with white hairs). For instance, a liver roan GSP has a deep reddish-brown coat lightened by white hairs. The GSP"s smooth, short coat is easy to groom and doesn"t shed excessively. Brush it weekly with a firm bristle brush and bathe only as needed. Rub your GSP"s coat with a towel or chamois to make it gleam. Be sure to check your GSP"s feet after he has been exercising or working in the field. Dry him thoroughly after hunting to prevent a chill. Examine the ears regularly for signs of infection, such as a bad odor, redness, or tenderness. If your GSP scratches frequently at his ears, he may have an infection.
German Shorthairs can do well with children if they"re raised with them. They have lots of energy and make excellent playmates for active older children. They can be too rambunctious for toddlers, however. Adult German Shorthairs who aren"t familiar with children may do best in a home with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. German Shorthairs can get along with other dogs, although some may be aggressive toward members of the same sex. Because they"re hunting dogs, they may also be aggressive toward small furry animals such as cats or rabbits. They can become socialized to them if raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not extend the same courtesies to strange animals who intrude on their property.

A combination of the best features of the Foxhound, Pointer, and Poodle, the German Wirehaired Pointer is a hunter"s best friend: a medium-size dog who can point and retrieve on land and in water, thanks to a wiry, functional coat that protects him from weather extremes and rough underbrush and a keen nose for tracking and pointing. A facial beard gives him a distinctive expression, and a docked tail held horizontally quivers with excitement. Known as the Drahthaar in his homeland of Germany, the breed was developed to be an all around hunting companion, useful for hunting all types of game in all conditions. Because of his heritage as a hunting breed, the German Wirehair requires extensive exercise and he can make an excellent jogging companion. He loves to swim and retrieve, both good ways to provide the level of activity he needs to burn off all that energy. The German Wirehaired Pointer loves having a job to do and thrives on attention. Training him to compete in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, or other dog sports gives him a job, mental stimulation, and exercise. The breed can be slightly independent so it"s important to use a firm, consistent approach and not to back down when he challenges your authority. That said, he doesn"t respond to harsh training methods but does best with motivational, reward-based training. Search and rescue dog handlers have recently discovered this breed and find them to be excellent workers. That"s not surprising since search and rescue combines their love of people and desire for plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. The German Wirehaired Pointer is a versatile dog who excels in the show ring, many physical competitions, and more. He can be your jogging friend early in the morning and sit around the campfire with you at night. If you like a dog who is intelligent, independent, eager to learn, and willing to please with tons of energy to burn, then you may have found the perfect addition to your household.
Can be independent and willful with a tendency to wander if not kept active and challenged Can be suspicious of strangers and aloof with all but his family If left alone too much can develop separation anxiety Can be slow to housetrain They can be aggressive towards other dogs, especially male-to-male aggression. Many have a strong instinct to chase cats and seize cats and other small pets. A bored German Wirehaired Pointer can make a shambles of your home and yard. Young German Wirehaired Pointers (up to about 2 years of age) romp and jump with great vigor, and things and people can go flying. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
German hunters in search of a rugged dog who could hunt any kind of game on any terrain created the German Wirehaired Pointer in the late 1800s. In him they blended the best qualities of the Pointer, Poodle, and Foxhound to develop an all-purpose dog who could point and retrieve on land and in water, no matter what the weather or environment. He is distinguished from the German Shorthaired Pointer not only by his coat but also by his size — slightly larger with a longer body — but also by differences in head shape and temperament. The two breeds were developed separately, with the Shorthair being slightly older and crosses of different breeds were used to develop each. The German Wirehaired Pointer was admitted into the German Kartell for dogs in 1928. He was imported into the United States in the 1920s, and in 1953, the German Drahthaar Club of America was formed. The breed was admitted into the AKC in 1959, when the parent club was officially changed to the German Wirehaired Pointer Club of America. He remains a well-loved hunting companion today.
Males stand 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder. Females are smaller but not under 22 inches. Expect a German Wirehair to weigh 60 to 70 pounds.
Affectionate and loyal to his family, the German Wirehaired Pointer is friendly toward people he knows but aloof with strangers. When raised in a family, he"s devoted to everyone but may have one person who"s a special favorite. More than just a hunting dog, he loves human companionship and makes an excellent house dog and family member as long as he receives plenty of physical and mental exercise. The GWP is a good watchdog, barking when strangers approach his property. He"s possessive of his things and people and may be aggressive toward strange dogs. He will defend his home and family if they"re in danger. Early socialization is a must, as it is with any breed. Trainers will find a sharp "No" more effective than harsh or rough treatment. Respect his intelligence, and you"ll find that he has a strong desire to please.
German Wirehairs are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all German Wirehairs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a German Wirehair. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, which usually affects the lower eyelid on a dog. When present in a dog, it is usually found in both eyes. It causes an impairment of vision and irritates the dog"s eyes. If your German Wirehair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes or that the eyes seem to tear up frequently. Entropion generally occurs before a dog turns a year old but surgery should be held off until the dog reaches adulthood. The treatment is multiple surgeries, in a gradual process so that the dog is not at risk for Ectropion, which is a rolling out of the eyelid. Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results. Von Willebrand"s disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.
The German Wirehaired Pointer was bred to hunt all day in the field and that"s what he"s happiest doing. Short of that, he requires plenty of daily exercise. He can be a mannerly housedog and thrives on human companionship. He can jump with ease, so keep him confined with a fence that"s at least six feet high and can"t be dug under or wriggled through. A covered dog run may be the best way to provide outdoor shelter.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Wirehair in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your German Wirehair, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The German Wirehaired Pointer has a functional double coat that protects him from wet and cold conditions as well as rough or heavy underbrush. The coarse, wiry coat is one to two inches long. The hair is straight and harsh and lies flat. In winter the undercoat is dense to provide effective insulation against the cold, but in summer it"s barely visible. The Wirehair"s beard and bushy eyebrows serve as more than decoration. They protect the dog"s face and eyes from scratches and lacerations. Some German Wirehairs are born with a long, soft, silky, or woolly coat. It doesn"t have the same properties as the wire coat and takes considerably more time and effort to care for. The German Wirehair coat comes in various patterns of liver and white: spotted, liver roan (a mix of reddish-brown and white hairs), spotted with roaning and ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), or solid liver, which is described as a deep reddish-brown. The liver-colored head sometimes has a white blaze, but the ears are liver-colored. To match the coat, he has a liver-colored nose, lips, and spotting in the mouth. Genetically, a liver dog can"t have a black spot, and a black dog can"t have a brown nose. If you"re offered a German Wirehair with a black coat or black pigmentation, you may not be getting the real deal. The dense, wiry coat of the German Wirehaired Pointer requires minimal grooming. It should remain clean with regular brushing. The coat sheds lightly year-round. Bathe him only as needed. Thanks to the water-repellent nature of his coat, he dries quickly after a bath or swim. Trim the nails routinely to keep them in good condition and to prevent toenail injuries. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Brush your German Wirehair"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your German Wirehair to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The German Wirehaired Pointer is a great companion for older children who can stand up to his size and energy level, but he may be overwhelming for younger children who are easily knocked down in play. Always supervise any interactions between a dog and children for the safety of both. A German Wirehaired Pointer does better with children when he is raised with them, but an adult Wirehair who"s adopted into a family with children can learn to get along with them if properly introduced and supervised. He may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but if he"s raised with them he gets along fine with other dogs and cats.

The Giant Schnauzer is the largest of the three Schnauzer breeds. He has a commanding appearance and rugged build. But his stoic demeanor is belied by the twinkle in his eyes, hinting at his playful nature. This is a big dog with a big personality. He"s an energetic, intelligent companion who makes life interesting with his independent thinking and playfulness, but dominant personality and bold approach to life. In short, he"s a handful, even for experienced dog owners. Still, in the right home he"s a loyal and courageous companion. There is no limit to the capabilities of a well-trained Giant Schnauzer. Obedience, agility, tracking, carting, and herding are among the dog sports in which you can find him competing. Originally used to drive cattle to market, he excels as a police and guard dog and more recently has branched out to drug detection and search and rescue. He has a gentle and loving side as well, making him an admirable therapy dog. But the Giant Schnauzer"s favorite activity is being with the people he loves. The keys to living successfully with a Giant Schnauzer include training, socialization, and providing physical and mental stimulation. Giant Schnauzers need all of these to become well-mannered dogs, and they need them in abundance. The breed"s intelligence is widely known, and they can be easily trained when their people are firm and consistent. Never let the Giant Schnauzer"s wonderful mind go to waste. Make sure to give him a job; let him find things for you, carry things, perform tricks, and show off his obedience training. Whatever you do, don"t let him become bored. A bored Giant Schnauzer is a destructive Giant Schnauzer. An essential part of preventing boredom is exercise. Expect to provide your Giant Schnauzer with at least an hour of vigorous exercise daily. He"ll enjoy long walks and jogging. Apartments are not the ideal dwelling for the Giant Schnauzer. They do much better if they have a large yard to play in and do their best if they have acreage. They are not outdoor dogs and need to live inside with their family. Giant Schnauzers are among the more dominant breeds and not recommended for homes with young children. In fact, the suggested age range of children is 12 and older. Socialization should begin at a very young age, and it should include exposure to many different people, dogs, and other small pets. Giant Schnauzers tend to be reserved and suspicious of strangers, a trait that makes them excellent guard dogs, but that characteristic must be balanced with socialization to avoid fearfulness or aggression. The Giant Schnauzer has many good qualities and many challenging qualities. It"s important before choosing this breed that you understand the demands he will make upon your life. A Giant Schnauzer is not the fabled gentle giant, but a hard-working, energetic dog who will give back as much as he is given.
Giant Schnauzers are energetic breed and require at least two long walks per day or 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise in the backyard. Without proper exercise and mental stimulation, Giant Schnauzers can become very destructive and difficult to handle. Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for first-time or timid owners. They need a strong leader who can provide clear and consistent rules without resorting to physical force. Although they are a very affectionate breed, the Giant Schnauzer is not recommended for homes with young children because of their size and forceful behavior. Giant Schnauzers will make excellent guard dogs. Apartments are not suitable dwellings for Giant Schnauzers. They need a large fenced yard where they can play and run safely. Socialization is a must with this breed. They can be aggressive toward people, dogs, and other animals they don"t know. They are naturally suspicious of strangers and need to become accustomed to experiencing new people and situations. Giant Schnauzers are companion dogs and should live indoors. They thrive when they are with the people they love. Giant Schnauzers require brushing one to three times a week. Their coats must also be stripped or clippered to remain neat looking. Giant Schnauzers are intelligent dogs who learn quickly and excel at a variety of jobs. Be firm and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Giant Schnauzers will see and take advantage of any inconsistencies in your behavior. Never buy a Giant Schnauzer from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The largest of the three Schnauzer breeds, the Giant Schnauzer was developed in Germany to drive cattle and later to work in butcher shops and stockyards. Some served as guard dogs at breweries. The Giant Schnauzer was probably created by crossing the Standard Schnauzer with larger smoothcoated dogs, rough-haired sheepdogs, and the black Great Dane. The Bouvier des Flandres may also have played a role in his development. He was known as the Munchener and was widespread throughout Bavaria and Wurttemberg. In the early 1900s, Giant Schnauzers were trained for police work in Berlin and other German cities, and it became their primary job. The only reason they didn"t become well known as police dogs in the United States is because the German Shepherds beat them to it. The Giant Schnauzer Club of America was founded in 1962. In the United States, the Giant Schnauzer has remained uncommon. Today, the breed ranks 83rd among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
A male Giant Schnauzer stands 25.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder and weighs 60 to 80 pounds. Females are 23.5 to 25.5 inches and weigh 55 to 75 pounds.
The Giant Schnauzer has the calm, loving temperament of a companion dog and the assertiveness, boldness and energy required of a guard and working dog. He takes his responsibilities seriously and is protective of home and family, willing to defend them with a fierceness that can be intimidating. This is a territorial dog who"s distrustful of strangers, but when he"s not needed as a guardian, he"s a playful and affectionate companion. His intelligence can pose a challenge to the inexperienced trainer, however. Giant Schnauzers require consistent and firm guidance. Without it, they"re quite capable of thinking for themselves and running the household the way they think it ought to be run. As with every dog, Giant Schnauzers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Giant Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Giant Schnauzers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Giant Schnauzers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): is usually found in the elbows but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. This disorder causes a painful stiffing of the joint where the dog will be unable to bend its elbow. It is caused by an improper growth of cartilage in the joints and can be hereditary, caused by trauma or improper diet. It can be detected in dogs as young as five to seven months of age. Although it is a genetic disorder, some research has linked high-protein diets to increasing the severity of this disorder. Autoimmune Thyroiditis: This is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in dogs and is recognized as a heritable condition. The disease tends to become evident at two to five years of age. Dogs may be clinically normal for years, only to become hypothyroid at a later date. Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: This cancer may occur on a toe or toes of dark-haired dogs, including Giant Schnauzers. If your Giant Schnauzer shows signs of lameness for no apparent reason, have your vet take a look at his toes. Removal of the affected toe before the cancer spreads to the chest cavity increases the chance of survival. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Giant Schnauzers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for apartments or condos. They have high energy levels indoors and out, and are best suited to a home with a fenced yard where they can safely run off some of that energy. When they"re not playing outdoors, Giant Schnauzers should be inside with their people, whom they will happily follow around the house. Giant Schnauzers require at least an hour of daily exercise. Plan on a couple of half-hour walks at a good clip or vigorous play. He can be a digger or chewer, so always give him something constructive to do instead. This is a breed that needs a job. Train him to do tricks or help you around the house if you want to forestall destructive behavior. He doesn"t like to be bored, so avoid frequent repetition and turn training into a challenging game to get the best out of him. Train him with firmness and consistency. He can be stubborn and you must be more stubborn. You must be able to provide leadership without resorting to physical force or harsh words. It"s best if you work with a trainer who"s familiar with and understands the breed. Your Giant Schnauzer will respond with enthusiasm to training techniques that are positive and keep him on his toes.
Recommended daily amount: 3 3/8 to 4 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Giant Schnauzer in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Giant Schnauzers can be prone to gastric torsion and should be fed two or three small meals per day to avoid any build up of gas. For more on feeding your Giant Schnauzer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Giant Schnauzer"s outer coat is wiry, hard, and dense, with hairs that stand up from the skin. Beneath it is a soft undercoat. On his face are a harsh beard and eyebrows, the Schnauzer hallmark. The coat is solid black or pepper and salt. The pepper-and-salt coloring is a combination of black and white hairs, and white hairs banded with black. At a short distance, the pepper-and-salt coat appears gray. The Giant Schnauzer"s double coat requires brushing with a stiff bristle or slicker brush about three times a week to prevent mats from forming in the undercoat. Wash his face after every meal. A Standard Schnauzer"s coat usually must be hand-stripped every 4 to 6 months. Hand stripping is necessary if you show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat, but pets can be clippered instead. Be warned, however, that if you clip your Schnauzer"s coat instead of stripping it, eventually the texture will change. It will feel very soft and may shed more. Clippering can also cause a pepper-and-salt coat to look solid silver or solid black, depending on the color of the undercoat. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Giant Schnauzer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Giant Schnauzer jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Giant Schnauzer accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Because of their size, energy level, and commanding nature, Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for homes with young children. The suggested age range is 12 and older who have the maturity to interact appropriately with a large-breed dog. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Giant Schnauzers don"t tend to be buddy-buddy with other dogs, especially those of the same sex, and they probably shouldn"t be trusted alone with cats, no matter how well they seem to get along.
Giant Schnauzers are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Giant Schnauzer who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

Dog Breed Group:  Terrier DogsHeight:  1 foot to 1 foot, 2 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  Up to 35 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
This powerful terrier was originally bred to be a tenacious hunter of fox, badger, and rodents, even pursuing his prey underground. Although the modern Glen is more likely to spend his days relaxing with his family, he still has a hunter"s heart. Nothing is more enjoyable to him than a good chase after a pesky squirrel or the neighbor"s cat — other than, perhaps, a good dig. A Glen will happily dig up your flower garden if you let him. You can put his hunter"s smarts to good use with training, so long as you keep it fun for him; otherwise, he"s likely to show his independent streak, and wander off in search of something more interesting. And you can channel his energy and athleticism into dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions. If you"re not interested in dog sports, you"ll need to find another way to help him burn off energy; Glens need daily exercise. And you"ll have to lock up the kibble and keep tempting people food out of reach; this dog has a hearty appetite, and can pack on the pounds very quickly if he"s allowed to overeat. The courageous Glen will defend his family if needed, and his loud warning bark will alert you whenever someone approaches the house, making him an excellent watchdog. But that same scrappy spirit can sometimes get him into trouble with other canines. He"s unlikely to start a fight, but you can be sure he won"t back down from one if challenged. Given enough time to interact with other dogs and practice his canine social skills, however, he can learn to get along with them. It"s not hard to fall in love with the affectionate nature and intelligence of this breed. But before you rush out to buy or adopt a Glen, consider that he has many traits common to terriers: a love of digging, an independent streak, and a inborn tendency to chase cats and other small animals. Whether these qualities make him your dream dog or last on your list, take them into account when considering a Glen.
Glens need daily exercise. Canine sports such as agility are a great way to let them burn off energy, but a brisk 30-minute walk around the neighborhood will do the trick, too. Originally bred to pursue their prey underground, the Glen was designed to dig and still has that drive today. If you want to save your flowerbeds, it"s wise to train your Glen to use a designated digging area in the yard. Glens enjoy playing and roughhousing and can be wonderful companions for children, although they"re strong and rambunctious enough to knock over small or young kids. Although they"re not known to be barkers, the Glen will bark a lot if you accidentally encourage him. Don"t run over to a barking Glen to see what the fuss is about — you"ll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he gets your attention. Teaching the "quiet" command is also helpful. The Glen can be aggressive to other dogs and needs plenty of time with other canines to learn how to get along with them, ideally beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten classes that give the pups time to play with each other, in addition to the obedience training, are an excellent way to help your dog hone his canine social skills. His strong prey instinct makes the Glen a poor fit for homes with other small pets that he may consider prey, such as cats, rabbits, and hamsters. It also means you"ll need to teach him good leash manners, so he doesn"t drag you halfway down the block when he spots something he wants to chase. The Glen was bred to be a hunter of small animals and has a strong inborn drive to chase. If you"ve got a yard, you"ll want a sturdy fence to keep your Glen from taking off after anything that wanders by that looks like prey. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Glen of Imaal Terrier comes from Ireland and takes his name from the remote valley in County Wicklow where he originated. Fans of the Glen believe the breed is descended from dogs brought by settlers — who were awarded land in the valley in exchange for serving in Queen Elizabeth I"s army — who mixed with the local canines. The breed was developed as a multi-purpose hunter, and was used to hunt fox and badger and rid the home of rodents. Because of his tenacious spirit, he was also used in organized dogfights. One of his most interesting jobs was the role of spit dog, in which the dog worked a treadmill-like contraption that powered the rotation of a cooking spit. The Glen was recognized by the Irish Kennel Club in 1933, one of the last of the Irish terriers to gain official recognition in Ireland. The Glen then had to wait 42 years before the British Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975, and another 12 years before the American Kennel Club followed suit, in 1987. The breed is still rare today, although the Glen is gaining popularity every year. He"s proving to be an excellent family dog and, for some owners, he carries on his traditional role as a capable hunting companion.
Males and females stand 12.5 to 14 inches tall, and weigh approximately 35 pounds.
The phrase "large dog in a small body" aptly describes this terrier. He"s brave and feisty and, although he rarely starts a fight with other dogs, he"s most likely to finish it. He will also protect his family if the need arises. He"s intelligent, loyal, and patient, traits that can make for a wonderful companion dog. As a family pet he gives his people plenty of affection, but he"s got an independent streak that"s led many people to label him stubborn.
Glens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Glens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Glens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Glens are also prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative eye disorder involving the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. It causes a gradual loss of vision and eventual blindness. Vets can detect PRA years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. If you"re buying a puppy, look for a reputable breeder who has her dogs" eyes tested and certified on a yearly basis.
The Glen is fairly low-maintenance. He enjoys the company of his human companions, and does best living in the house with them. Training is generally easy with this breed since he"s intelligent and enjoys learning. The key to making training a breeze is to keep it fresh and interesting; do not bore the Glen with repetitive training. When bored, he"ll show his stubborn streak by ignoring you, playing around, or wandering off to sniff his surroundings. The Glen is not an overly noisy breed, but if you accidentally encourage him, he"ll bark and bark and bark. Don"t ever run over to see what the fuss is about when he barks — you"ll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he"ll get the attention of his favorite person. Teaching a "Quiet" command as part of his basic canine manners is a good idea. The Glen needs daily exercise; a brisk, 30-minute walk in the neighborhood will satisfy his need to move. Glens give themselves plenty of exercise too, playing and romping around the house. The breed can be just as happy in an apartment as in a home with a large yard. One word of caution: the Glen, like many other terriers, enjoys — no, loves — digging, and this trait isn"t as easy to deter as barking. You can save your flowerbeds by training your Glen to dig only in one designated spot in your yard.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Glen in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Glen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Glen coat is medium length, with a harsh-textured topcoat and shorter undercoat. The coat comes in several shades of wheaten, from cream to red; any shade of blue, from silver to slate; and brindle, a tiger stripe-like pattern that mixes one dominant color with darker streaks or patches. The Glen is considered to be a non- to low-shedding breed. Grooming the Glen is easy. This isn"t a fussy breed, and there"s no need to make too much fuss over his coat. Brushing once or twice a week keeps the coat from tangling, and a bath every three months or so — or whenever he"s rolled in something smelly — keeps it clean. Glens who compete in the show ring have trimmed coats, but it"s fine to let a family dog go au naturel. Show Glens aren"t trimmed with clippers, like other breeds, but stripped — the coat is thinned and shortened with a sharp, comb-like tool called a stripping knife. Stripping helps Glens maintain the coarse coat that show judges like to see in terriers. Brush your Glen"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Glen enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Glen to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Glen is a great family pet, playful and kind with children. He"s an extremely strong and muscular terrier, though, and can play too rough for very young and small children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. If he"s spent plenty of time around other dogs, especially in puppyhood, the Glen can get along with other canines. He does have a strong personality, however, that can lead to quarrels. And because he was bred to hunt small prey, the Glen isn"t recommended for homes with small furry pets that are allowed to roam free. He"ll chase, and possibly kill, cats, mice, gerbils, hamster, rabbits, and other small animals.
Glens are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and or fostering. Glen of Imaal Terrier Rescue Foundation Glen of Imaal Terrier Club Rescue

The idea was to create a working dog with the sensitivity of the Golden Retriever and the tolerance of the Labrador Retriever. It worked. Cross them, and the result is the unequivocally genial Goldador. Thanks to their easygoing nature and keen intelligence, Goldadors have proven outstanding guide dogs, service dogs, search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs, and bomb detection dogs. But like their parent breeds, Goldadors are happiest simply working alongside a person they love. Goldadors are active and require at least half an hour of daily exercise — most enjoy retrieving games as well as hiking and swimming. Once they"ve reached physical maturity (between 18 and 24 months), Goldadors make excellent jogging companions. Training the eager-to-please Goldador is relatively easy - they come from a long line of dogs who work closely and willingly with people. This makes them an excellent choice for first-time owners, provided they get the exercise, structure, and positive reinforcement they crave. Goldadors are also a good option for families with children (though they can be a bit rambunctious for toddlers), as they want nothing more than to be part of family activities. The ideal residence for a Goldador is a home with a fenced yard, but with regular exercise and companionship they can live and thrive in apartments and condos. Whatever his home, a Goldador should live indoors with his people.
Goldadors like to eat and can easily become overweight if they don"t get enough exercise. Goldadors are good family dogs and generally do well with children of all ages. The Goldador sheds moderately and requires weekly brushing. Goldadors usually get along well with other dogs and pets, especially when they"re raised with them or socialized to them at an early age. Goldadors require about 30 minutes of exercise per day. They enjoy being outdoors and can make excellent jogging companions. Although a house with a fenced yard is the ideal home for a Goldador, he can do well in an apartment or condo with proper exercise. Goldadors can be a good choice for first-time dog owners. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Goldador was first developed more than a decade ago: the Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever were crossed with the hopes of creating a sensitive, tolerant working dog. The effort proved successful. Organizations that train guide and assistance dogs often use these Lab/Golden crosses. As a companion, the Goldador has not yet gained the popularity of some other so-called "designer" dogs, such as Labradoodles. At this time, there are no breed clubs or any efforts to create a breed standard for the Goldador.
The Goldador is one of the few designer breeds with a fairly predictable size, as both parent breeds are large and similar in size and shape. The Goldador is usually 22 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 60 to 80 pounds.
The Goldador is affectionate and loyal, alert enough to make an excellent watchdog, but too friendly to be an effective guard dog. He loves children and gets along with other animals, especially when he"s been raised with them. His intelligence and desire to please render him highly trainable, and he responds best to positive reinforcement techniques. He"s capable of working and thinking independently - and does so beautifully as an assistance dog - but he prefers to have guidance and structure in his life. This is a people-loving dog who won"t be happy left to himself in the backyard. Like every dog, Goldadors need early socialization: exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Goldador puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Goldadors are prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldadors will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this mix. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication and weight loss to control the pain. Cataracts are an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels are regulated in part by insulin, which is produced in the pancreas. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are hungry even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate, but he will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Signs of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and daily insulin injections. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Before purchasing a Goldador, it"s important to research the health concerns that occur with both the Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, heart, and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.
The ideal home for a Goldador is a house with a fenced yard where he can play safely; however, he can do well in an apartment or condo if he gets daily walks or runs. Either way, exercise is very important for a Goldador"s health and happiness — at least 30 minutes per day is ideal. Interested in dog sports? Goldadors make formidable competitors in agility and flyball. Mental stimulation is crucial as well. Teach your Goldador to fetch the paper or your slippers, practice obedience training regularly with him, and put his mind to work from time to time with an interactive dog toy. As with all dogs, positive reinforcement techniques (praise, play, and food rewards) work best with the Goldador. He"s sensitive, and harsh corrections will damage his confidence.
Recommended daily amount: 3.5 to 4.25 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference-the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Goldador, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A Goldador should have the same double coat as a Labrador Retriever, with a short, thick, straight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat (some have a slight wave down the back). Generally, a Goldador"s coat color ranges from yellow to gold to reddish gold, but because the Goldador is a crossbreed, he may inherit the black coat of a Lab parent. Weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush will remove dead hair, helping to keep it off your clothes and furniture. During seasonal shedding periods, however, daily brushing is recommended. Bathe your Goldador as needed, and be sure to give him a thorough freshwater rinse any time he goes swimming. The Goldador can be prone to ear infections, so check and clean the ears weekly. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Goldador"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Goldador jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Goldador to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently - dogs are touchy about their feet - and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Goldadors are an ideal family companion and are generally gentle and loving toward children of all ages. As puppies, they can be a bit rambunctious and may knock over smaller children unintentionally, so close supervision is important. Social and easy-going, Goldadors do well with other dogs and pets, especially when raised together. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.

Golden Retriever Puppies Experience Fall For The First Time It"s no surprise that the Golden Retriever is one of the top ten most popular dogs in the U.S. It"s all good with the Golden: he"s highly intelligent, sociable, beautiful, and loyal. He"s also lively. The Golden is slow to mature and retains the silly, playful personality of a puppy until three to four years of age, which can be both delightful and annoying. Many keep their puppyish traits into old age. Originally bred for the physically demanding job of retrieving ducks and other fowl for hunters, the Golden needs daily exercise: a walk or jog, free time in the yard, a run at the beach or lake (Goldens love water), or a game of fetch. And like other intelligent breeds who were bred to work, they need to have a job to do, such as retrieving the paper, waking up family members, or competing in dog sports. A tired Golden is a well-behaved Golden. As well as giving your Golden Retriever physical and mental exercise, you should also be prepared to include him in your family activities. The Golden Retriever is a family dog, and he needs to be with his "pack." Don"t consider getting a Golden unless you"re willing to have him in the house with you, underfoot, every day. There"s one other potential drawback to the breed: He"s definitely not a watchdog. He might bark when strangers come around, but don"t count on it. Most likely, he"ll wag his tail and flash that characteristic Golden smile.
Golden Retrievers shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Daily brushing will get some of the loose hair out of the coat, keeping it from settling on your clothing and all over your house. But if you live with a Golden, you"ll have to get used to dog hair. Golden Retrievers are family dogs; they need to live indoors with their human "pack," and shouldn"t spend hours alone in the backyard. Golden Retrievers are active dogs who need 40-60 minutes of hard exercise daily. They thrive on obedience training, agility classes, and other canine activities, which are a great way to give your dog physical and mental exercise. Although they"re gentle and trustworthy with kids, Golden Retrievers are boisterous, large dogs that can accidentally knock over a small child. Goldens love to eat, and will quickly become overweight if overfed. Limit treats, measure out your dog"s daily kibble, and feed him in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. Because the Golden Retriever is so popular, there are many people breeding Goldens who care more about making money out of the demand for puppies than in breeding happy, healthy dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
For many years, there was a legend that Golden Retrievers were descended from Russian sheepdogs bought from a circus. In fact, the breed was developed in Scotland, at the highland estate of Sir Dudley Majoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth. Tweedmouth, like many gentry of his day, bred animals of all kinds, trying to perfect different breeds. Tweedmouth"s breeding records from 1835 to 1890 show what he was aiming for with the Golden: A talented retriever — Tweedmouth was an ardent waterfowl hunter — with a superb nose, who would be more attentive to his human hunting companion than the setters and spaniels used at the time for retrieving. He also wanted the dog to be loyal and even-tempered in the home. Tweedmouth took Nous home to Scotland, and in 1868 and 1871, bred him to Belle, a Tweed Water Spaniel. Tweed Water Spaniels (now extinct) were known for being eager retrievers in the hunting field, and exceptionally calm and loyal in the home — characteristics you"ll find in today"s Golden Retrievers. Nousand Belle"s descendants were bred with Wavy- and Flat-coated retrievers, another Tweed Water Spaniel, and a red setter. Tweedmouth kept mostly the yellow puppies to continue his breeding program, and gave others away to friends and relatives. Not surprisingly, Tweedmouth"s breed first attracted attention for their skills in the hunting field. One of the most well-known was Don of Gerwyn, a liver-coated descendent of one of Tweedmouth"s dogs, who won the International Gundog League trial in 1904. The Kennel Club in England officially recognized the Golden Retriever as a distinct breed in 1911. At that time, they were classified as "Retriever — Yellow or Golden." In 1920, the breed name was officially changed to Golden Retriever. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1932. Today, the Golden Retriever is the second most popular breed in the U.S.
Males are 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 65 to 75 pounds. Females are generally 21.5 to 22.5 inches tall and 55 to 65 pounds. Golden Retrievers usually reach their full height by one year of age, and their mature weight by two.
A sweet, calm nature is the hallmark of the breed. The Golden was bred to work with people, and is eager to please his owner. Though hard-wired with a good disposition, like all dogs the Golden must be well-raised and well-trained to make the most of his heritage. Like every dog, the Golden needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Golden puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Goldens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Goldens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle (out-flow) and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Allergies: Golden Retrievers can be allergic to a variety of substances, ranging from food to pollen. If your Golden is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, have him checked by your vet. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes periodic seizures and convulsions. Your vet will need to know how severe the seizures are and how often they occur to determine what medication to prescribe, if any. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that"s thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Hemangiosarcoma: This is a very dangerous form of cancer that originates in the lining of blood vessels and spleen. It most commonly occurs in middle-age and elderly dogs. Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that"s common in large and giant breeds.
Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog, your Golden will be happy to join you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard, they"d be more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens love to retrieve. Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog mellow when he"s back inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems. Like other retriever breeds, Goldens are naturally "mouthy," and they"re happiest when they have something to carry in their mouths: a ball, soft toy, newspaper, or best of all, a smelly sock. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Don"t let your Golden puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Golden in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. For more on feeding your Golden, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Golden Retrievers have a dense, water-repellent outer coat with a thick undercoat. Some coats are wavy, some are straight. The fur feathers on the back of the front legs and underbody, with heavier feathering on the chest, back of the thighs, and tail. Golden Retrievers come in all shades of gold, from light to dark gold. Some breeders have begun selling "rare white Goldens," but the American Kennel Club does not recognize white as a coat color for the breed. Golden Retrievers shed moderately in the winter and summer, and heavily in the spring and fall. If you live with a Golden, you"ll need to adapt to a certain amount of dog hair in your house and on your clothes. The Golden"s thick coat means lots of grooming. Daily brushing is recommended to prevent tangling, and once a week is the bare minimum. Your Golden will also need a bath at least once a month, often more frequently, to keep him looking and smelling clean. Brush your Golden"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Fold-over ears create a warm, dark environment for bacteria or fungus to grow in, and breeds that have them — such as the Golden — are prone to ear infections. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. Check them every time he gets wet, too. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Golden to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.  
The amiable Golden Retriever isn"t bothered by the noise and commotion of kids — in fact, he thrives on it. He"s a large, strong dog, though, and he can easily knock over a small child by mistake. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Golden"s attitude toward other pets is the more the merrier. He enjoys the companionship of other dogs, and with proper introductions and training, can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.

Also known as the Groodle, the Goldendoodle ranges in size from small to large, depending on the variant of Poodle that the Golden Retriever is crossed with. Originally bred as a larger alternative to the already popular designer breed known as the Cockapoo, the Goldendoodle has proven to be an excellent family dog. They"re also versatile working dogs. Goldendoodles have achieved success as guide dogs, service dogs, therapy dogs, and sniffer dogs (one study tested their success at sniffing out peanuts in foods for owners with nut allergies). Goldendoodles have also done well in agility. The Goldendoodle is an affectionate and gentle dog that has gained popularity since he was first developed in 1990s. He"s still a young cross compared to other designer breeds, and many of today"s litters are the results of first-generation breedings between Poodles and Golden Retrievers. Goldendoodles are usually highly social and get along well with everyone. They don"t do well in any type of guarding or watchdog role and should not be used in that capacity. They can thrive in both city and country settings, but they"re not well suited to apartment living, since they do better with the space provided by a fenced yard. Goldendoodles should not live outside or in a kennel, however, since they thrive when they are in contact with the people they love. Goldendoodles can be very easy to train and are a good match for first-time or timid owners. They"re not known to have any aggressive traits, but they do need proper socialization to avoid any shyness or fearfulness. Goldendoodles also need daily contact with their owners; they"ll suffer from separation anxiety if they"re left for too long. The best way to avoid any destructive behavior is to crate them and to provide toys and treats to keep them busy throughout the day. Keeping the radio on when you"re out is another great way to keep them happy. Goldendoodles are considered to be non- to light shedders and may be a good match for people with allergies. They do require weekly or biweekly brushing, and many owners opt to have them clipped. Although Goldendoodles are a young designer breed, that hasn"t stopped people from understanding their worth. They have become popular quickly, and their star is still rising. They make excellent family dogs and provide gentle, intelligent companionship throughout their lifetimes.
Designer dogs, also called hybrids, aren"t true breeds — they"re crosses of two specific breeds. If you"re interested in a Goldendoodle puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren"t as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don"t know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog. The Goldendoodle is the result of Poodle to Golden Retriever breedings. So far there are very few multigenerational breedings (crosses between two Goldendoodles). The Goldendoodle is considered to be a non- to light shedder, but he requires regular grooming and clipping. If the coat is kept short, it should be clipped every six to eight weeks and brushed every few weeks. If the coat is kept in its natural state, it should be brushed once every week or two. The Goldendoodle is not a watch dog, and he"s generally not known to be noisy. He may not bark even if someone knocks on the door. Although he"s got an average energy level, the Goldendoodle is not recommended for apartments. He does much better in a home with a fenced yard. The Goldendoodle requires about 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise. Being a wonderful family companion, the Goldendoodle generally gets along well with children and does well with other dogs and family pets. The Goldendoodle is a very social dog who should not live away from his family. He"s are not suited to living in a kennel or outside; he wants to be in the house. The Goldendoodle can suffer from separation anxiety if left for long periods at a time. The Goldendoodle may make an excellent companion to people with allergies. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Goldendoodle is considered to be one of the newest of the "Doodle," or Poodle mix, breeds. Breeding began in the 1990s, after both the Cockapoo and the Labradoodle gained footholds. The theory behind the Goldendoodle"s development was to create a larger Doodle that maintained the desired low-dander, low-shedding coat and that possessed the intelligent and friendly nature of the Golden Retriever. The fact that the Goldendoodle is still a fairly young cross means that most pups are the result of first-generation breeding. That is, most are Golden Retriever and Poodle mixes; as of yet, breeding rarely occurs between pairs of Goldendoodles. Despite the fact that the Goldendoodle has gained some popularity, especially in Australia, there is still no breed club or registry in existence. There are, however, several online communities for the Goldendoodle lover and owner. The Goldendoodle"s popularity is still on the rise, and many believe that it will surpass that of other Doodle breeds.
Goldendoodles vary in size. This is because, at this stage, they"re rarely the result of multigenerational breedings (in which one Goldendoodle is crossed with another), and there are no breed standards that Goldendoodle breeders are aiming for. However, the Goldendoodle tends to come in three different sizes: Miniature, Small Standard, and Large Standard. The Miniature Goldendoodle is the result of a Miniature or Toy Poodle crossed with a Golden Retriever. These dogs tend to range in size from 13 to 20 inches in height and 15 to 35 pounds in weight. The average height for a Small Standard Goldendoodle is 17 to 20 inches; the weight is 40 to 50 pounds. The Large Standard Goldendoodle averages 20 to 24 inches in height and weighs 50 to 90 pounds.
The Goldendoodle has not become popular for lack of good reason. His positive personality traits are numerous — he endears himself to everyone he meets with his friendly, intelligent, accepting nature. Usually highly affectionate, he"s gentle and patient and makes a wonderful family companion, especially since he actively enjoys human company. He is loyal and, with proper training, can be highly obedient. He does have a playful side and can be mischievous if the mood hits. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Goldendoodle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Goldendoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Goldendoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldendoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Goldendoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Ear Infections: These can be a problem for Goldendoodles because of their floppy ears, which trap moisture. Check and clean the ears regularly. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition (though it"s also sometimes triggered by malnutrition) in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this condition is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Goldendoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as large Goldendoodles. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.
The Goldendoodle can be easy to train. Intelligent, he"s usually eager to please — a perfect combination for either first-time trainers or experienced trainers. He should be trained with positive reinforcement, since harsh corrections could damage his confidence. Socialization is important for all breeds, but for a gentle dog like the Goldendoodle it can be instrumental in discouraging any shyness or timidity. The Goldendoodle has an average energy level and will require daily exercise through walks or a good romp in the back yard. Generally speaking, 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise will be enough to keep a Goldendoodle from becoming bored. He"s known for his love of water, so swimming provides another opportunity for appropriate exercise. Since the Goldendoodle may grow large, he does require room to move. He"s not recommended for apartments but should have a home with some type of fenced yard. He"s not an ideal pet for outdoor or kennel living, since he thrives when he"s with his family, so owners should expect to keep him primarily in the house. The Goldendoodle can also suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behavior, if he"s left alone for long periods at a time.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 4 cups (depending on adult size) of high-quality dry food a day, divided into multiple meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Goldendoodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. A Goldendoodle should also be fed several small meals per day instead of one large one, since the Golden Retriever can suffer from gastric torsion, or bloat, a trait that can be easily passed on to any Goldendoodle offspring. For more on feeding your Goldendoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Goldendoodle should have a wavy to curly coat of about two to three inches in length. He has longer hair on the tail, body, ears, and legs (legs may be slightly feathered); the hair on the head and muzzle tends to be shorter. The coat can be black, copper, white, cream, gray, golden, apricot, or red, although golden seems to be the common coat color. White can often be found on the feathering, and the Goldendoodle"s coat tends to lighten with age. Although he"s considered a non- to light shedder, the Goldendoodle still requires some grooming to keep his coat in the best shape possible. Owners generally opt to clip the coat for easier maintenance; but if you choose to leave it in its natural state, expect to brush it about once every week or two. If he"s clipped, he"ll still need a good brushing every few weeks. The Goldendoodle requires a bath only when it"s absolutely necessary, or his coat and skin will lose necessary oils and moisture. Brush your Goldendoodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Goldendoodle to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Goldendoodle makes a wonderful family pet, especially if his nature takes after the Golden Retriever parent. He"s likely to be highly patient and gentle and to get along well with children of all ages. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He does well in homes with other dogs and pets and doesn"t actively show aggression toward other animals. Of course, as with all dogs, it"s important to properly socialize your Goldendoodle from puppyhood.

"Brains, beauty, and bird sense" is a phrase often applied to the Gordon Setter. If you"ve ever had the privilege of seeing the breed in the field, you understand why. In art, he"s often depicted as scouring the moors for a pheasant or other bird, and in life he does the same, pretty as a picture with his long, soft, straight black and tan coat, feathered tail, and noble, dignified stance. The Gordon is the largest of all Setters. He"s an active, well-muscled dog capable of working but who would also remain a puppy for his entire life if he could. Gordons are known for maturing late and tend to remain young at heart. The breed is intelligent, gentle, and loyal. Gordons need daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can expend their energy. The Gordon is not a backyard dog by any means, however, and should not live away from his family. He"s prone to separation anxiety and can become destructive when left alone for long periods. Gordon Setters need a firm hand when it comes to training but not so firm that their sensitive spirit is damaged. Consistent, firm, fair training using the techniques of positive reinforcement will prevent them from becoming dominant, wilful and stubborn. The mental activity provided by training will help keep them occupied and out of trouble. Some Gordons can be aggressive toward other dogs, but it"s not a common trait in the breed, and they should never be vicious. Toward strangers Gordons can be aloof, preferring the attention of their own people. They"ll tolerate attention from strangers but don"t actively seek it. To avoid any aggression or fear regarding strangers, it"s important to socialize your Gordon Setter — expose him to a variety of people, sights, sounds, and situations — in puppyhood. A properly socialized Gordon is alert and fearless, an excellent watchdog. The Gordon Setter is a loving companion and steady protector of the children in his life. Gordons are generally patient with children and tolerate much of their teasing and treatment, although of course they shouldn"t have to. It"s always important to supervise interactions between children and dogs. Known for their vocal skills, Gordons can be verbal in conveying their likes, dislikes, and other feelings. When they"re provided with the attention and exercise they crave, they"re loving, protective, and intensely devoted to their families.
Adult Gordon Setters require one to two hours of daily exercise. This can be a game of fetch in a field or backyard, a run, or a couple of long walks. Gordon Setters do well with children and may be protective of the children in their family. In general, they make wonderful, caring companions for children and their whole family. It is important to remember that dogs and small children should never be left unsupervised, regardless of breed. Being an intelligent, hardworking breed, the Gordon Setter can become destructive if his needs for exercise and mental stimulation are not met. Boredom and extra energy are not a great mix to have, and the best way to avoid any destructiveness is through proper exercise and training. Gordon Setters are not backyard dogs. They are much happier when they are with their families and should not live away from them. They enjoy personal attention and family activities. Gordon Setters are generally rambunctious when they are young but usually become gentle and calm as they get older. Strong temperaments are well known in the breed and many owners have the feeling that they are "owned" and not owner. Gordons are independent and determined, qualities that can translate to stubbornness to some. Gordon Setters make excellent watchdogs and are wary of strangers. They may seem aloof to some but are loving toward their own family. Barking is not uncommon in the breed, and Gordons will bark to express their likes, dislikes, and other emotions, including whether they think you should have taken them with you when you left. Gordon Setters can suffer from separation anxiety and may become destructive when they do. Gordon Setters shed, and their coat requires more than minimal grooming. If you do not have the time needed to properly groom them, this may not be the breed for you. Although many Gordon Setters get along well with other animals, some may be aggressive toward other dogs. Socialization is important for all dogs and should be started as possible. Gordon Setters are not recommended for apartment living. Although they are generally quiet indoors, they need a large fenced yard to exercise in. They love to run so a fenced yard is a must. Although Gordon Setters are known for their stubbornness, they can be sensitive and easily cowed with abuse and neglect. Never treat your dog harshly but instead give him firm, fair, consistent training without the use of anger or physical force. If Gordon Setters aren"t trained they may become destructive, wilful, and dominant. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Black and tan setting dogs were known in Scotland as early as 1620, but it was their presence in the kennels of the fourth Duke of Gordon 200 years later that brought them to prominence. The Castle Gordon Setters had first-class hunting skills and were beautiful as well. It was written of them: "They are not fast dogs, but they have good staying powers and can keep on steadily from morning until night. Their noses are first class and they seldom make a false point. When they stand, you may be sure there are birds." The early Gordons also came in black and white, tricolor, and red, but the Duke was said to favor the dogs with black and tan coloring, and that"s what has prevailed over the years. When the Duke died in 1827, his heir, the Duke of Richmond, carried on his kennels. Between 1859 and 1874, England"s Kennel Club listed 126 Black and Tan setters in its studbook. In June of 1859, at the first official dog show, a Black and Tan Setter by the name of Dandie, took first prize for setters, who could trace his pedigree back to the kennels of the Duke of Gordon. The breed officially took the name Gordon Setter in 1924. The first Gordon Setters imported into the United States came from the kennel at Gordon Castle. The dogs, Rake and Rachel, were purchased by Daniel Webster and George Blunt in 1842. They were the foundation of the breed in the United States. The American Kennel Club recognized the Gordon Setter in 1892, and the Gordon Setter Club of America, Inc., was formed in 1924. The club is still in existence today and boasts a membership of more than 1,000. Today the Gordon Setter ranks 88th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The Gordon Setter male stands 24 to 27 inches and weighs 55 to 80 pounds; females are 23 to 26 inches and 45 to 70 pounds.
The loyal Gordon Setter is intensely devoted to his family but wary of strangers, characteristics that make him an excellent watchdog. He"s mannerly and eager to please, but like any dog he"ll take advantage of lax leadership and can become dominant, wilfull, and stubborn if not provided with firm, fair, consistent training. A Gordon Setter expert once wrote of the breed that if he acts sorry for a misdeed, he"s probably more sorry that he got caught than that he misbehaved. In the field or in any competitive situation, he"s alert, fearless, intelligent, and capable. He"s a personal hunting dog, in the sense that he works nearby rather than ranging far afield. Gordons aren"t fast, but they have a lot of stamina. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Gordon Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Gordon Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. It"s not unusual for a Gordon puppy to go through a fear period sometime between 6 and 9 months of age. Without coddling him, maintain a calm demeanor so you can reassure him that whatever situation has spooked him is normal and nothing to be afraid of.
Gordons are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Gordons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a Gordon. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Gastric Dilatation Volvulus (Bloat): Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
Gordon Setters need daily strenuous exercise, so they"re good companions for joggers or runners. A good game of fetch in the backyard or a long walk will also contribute to their physical well being. Puppies are rambunctious and full of the devil. Let them play all they want in the backyard, but limit forced exercise such as road running or obedience jumps to avoid placing unnecessary strain on the still developing bones and joints. Avoid these types of workouts until the dog is 2 years old and introduce them gradually. Gordon Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force. Housetraining is fairly easy with most Gordon Setters, although there are exceptions to every rule. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. Crate training not only aids in housetraining, it also keeps the puppy from chewing (a common habit of Gordon puppies) and provides a safe and quiet place for the dog to rest. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Gordon puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he"s 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it"s important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break. The silver lining to the Gordon"s wild puppyhood is his quiet and sedate adulthood. He loves competition, however, and can excel in many dog sports. The Gordon can be a busy breed, but once you understand his drive and meet his needs, he can be a wonderful companion who"s just as happy to lie beside you as he is hiking or hunting beside you.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Gordon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Gordon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Gordon Setter"s attractive coat is soft and shiny, ranging from straight to slightly wavy. He has long hair on the ears, chest, belly, the back of the legs, and the tail. The tail is short, with feathering that grows in a triangular shape, becoming uniformly shorter toward the end of the tail. He wears a classic black and tan coat, with the tan markings being a rich chestnut or mahogany on the sides and bottom of the muzzle, over the eyes, on the throat, two large spots on the chest, on the inside of the hind legs (although not so much that the black is eliminated), on the forelegs, and around the vent (the anal opening). The black and tan colors are clearly defined, never mixed together. A Gordon may have a white spot on the chest, the smaller the better. Brush and comb your Gordon two or three times weekly to prevent mats and tangles. Trim the hair on the bottom of his feet and between the toes to prevent it from picking up debris in the summer and forming ice balls in winter. Brushing will go a long way toward keep your Gordon"s coat clean and shiny, but you can bathe him every one or two weeks if you want without drying out the coat. Just be sure to use a shampoo and conditioner formulated for dogs and rinse thoroughly. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Gordon"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Gordon may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Gordon"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Gordon enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Gordon to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Gordons are fond of and protective toward children. They"ll put up with a lot, and when they"ve had enough teasing or roughhousing, they"ll walk away. They may be a bit much for toddlers, though, being large enough to accidentally knock them down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Gordons get along with other dogs and cats if they"re raised with them, but they might not be so friendly toward strange dogs.

The Great Dane was originally bred to hunt wild boar, but he probably wouldn"t be very good at it today. The ferociousness necessary to track down such a large, wily animal was eventually bred out of the Great Dane. He"s now a gentle soul who generally gets along well with other dogs, animals, and humans. However, his size and his power bark will scare the wits out of a burglar. Anyone who owns one of these dogs eventually understands that while you may be used to his awesome size, others usually need a little time to get there. The Great Dane was developed from Mastiff-type dogs, but he"s more refined than other descendents of this ancient breed. A Great Dane is sleek and elegant. He has an athletic, muscular body. His massive head — and massive is the right word — is long and narrow. He"s got a long, graceful neck. His ears can be cropped or left natural. (Cropped ears are common in the U.S., but in other countries, ear-cropping is banned.) His size can present problems. Eyeballing a dog who weighs what you do makes some folks nervous. His tail can knock over a lot of things, particularly in a small space. And given the opportunity, he"s an impressive counter surfer. Luckily, he isn"t rambunctious or highly energetic. Size notwithstanding, a Great Dane is a sweet, affectionate companion. He loves to play and is gentle with children. He has a peaceful disposition, although he hasn"t lost any of the courageousness that helped him hunt wild boar. Although he isn"t particularly vocal (despite his killer power bark), he wouldn"t hesitate to defend his family. Even given his inherent gentleness, it"s advisable to teach him good manners and attend obedience training classes when he"s young. His sheer size alone could make him impossible to control when he"s an adult, and — as with any dog — you never know when he might see something he just has to chase. He"s eager to please and highly people-oriented, demanding a great deal of attention from those around him. He tends to nudge people with that big old head of his when he wants to be petted. Sometimes you"ll meet one with lapdog tendencies who see no reason not to hop onto the sofa and drape themselves on you. Surprisingly, the Great Dane typically doesn"t eat as much food as you"d think. And while he needs daily exercise, he doesn"t need a huge yard to play in (although he certainly would enjoy one). Because of his beauty and gentle nature, more and more people are discovering the Great Dane. He currently ranks as the 24th most popular dog breed, according to registrations with the American Kennel Club. Just be aware that because of his size, he"s got a relatively short life span of around eight years old. That means he takes up a huge space in your heart for a short amount of time.
The Great Dane is sweet, eager to please, people-oriented, easy to housetrain, and he responds well to training using positive reinforcement. Like many giant dogs, Great Danes are short-lived. Great Danes require a lot of space. Even though they make great housedogs, they need a lot of room just to move around. There"s little that they can"t reach (kitchen counters and dinner tables are no problem), and their tails can easily sweep your coffee table clean. Everything costs more when you have a big dog — collars, veterinary care, heartworm preventive, food. In addition, you"ll need both a crate and a vehicle that are large enough to hold your Great Dane without crumpling him into a pretzel. And let"s face it, you"ll scoop up a lot of poop. It takes a while for the bones and joints of large dogs such as Great Danes to stop growing and become stable. Don"t allow your Great Dane puppy to jump, and don"t take him jogging until he"s at least 18 months old; this will reduce stress on the growing bones and joints. The Dane"s special giant-breed dietary requirements have to be followed, or else orthopedic issues can develop. Great Danes aren"t particularly suited to apartments or small houses, simply because they"re so big. They"re not jumpers, fortunately, so a six-foot fence will contain them. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Drawings of dogs who look like Great Danes have been found on Egyptian artifacts dating back to 3000 B.C. and in Babylonian temples that were built around 2000 B.C. There"s evidence that similar dogs originated in Tibet, with written reports of such dogs appearing in Chinese literature in 1121 B.C. The breed is thought to have been taken into various parts of the world by the Assyrians, who traded their dogs to the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks and Romans then bred these dogs with other breeds. Ancestors of the English Mastiff were probably involved in the breed development, and some folks believe that the Irish Wolfhound or Irish Greyhound also may have played a role. Great Danes originally were called Boar Hounds, because boars were what they were bred to hunt. Their ears were cropped to prevent boar tusks from tearing them. In the 16th century, the name of the breed was changed to "English Dogges." Late in the 1600s, however, many German nobles began keeping the largest and most handsome of their dogs in their homes, calling them Kammerhunde (Chamber Dogs). These dogs were pampered and wore gilded collars lined with velvet. Talk about a sweet life. The name Great Dane arose in the 1700s, when a French naturalist traveled to Denmark and saw a version of the Boar Hound who was slimmer and more like a Greyhound in appearance. He called this dog Grand Danois, which eventually became Great Danish Dog, with the more massive examples of the breed called Danish Mastiffs. The name stuck, even though Denmark did not develop the breed. Most breed historians give credit to German breeders for refining the breed to be the well-balanced, elegant dog we love today. In 1880, breeders and judges held a meeting in Berlin and agreed that since the dogs they were breeding were distinctly different from the English Mastiff, they would give it its own name — Deutsche Dogge (German Dog). They founded the Deutscher Doggen-Klub of Germany, and many other European countries took up the name as well. The Italians and English-speaking countries didn"t accept this name, however. (Even today, the Italians call the breed Alano, meaning Mastiff; and in English-speaking countries, of course, they"re called Great Danes.) Throughout the late 1800s, wealthy German breeders continued to refine the breed. They turned their attention to the dog"s temperament, because Great Danes had aggressive, ferocious temperaments due to the fact that they were originally bred to hunt wild boar, a particularly ferocious beast. These breeders tried to produce more gentle animals, and — luckily for us today — they succeeded. We don"t know when the first Great Danes were brought to the U.S., or even where they came from, but the Great Dane Club of America was formed in 1889. It was the fourth breed club allowed to join the American Kennel Club.
Male Great Danes are 30 to 34 inches tall and weigh 120 to 200 pounds. Females are 28 to 32 inches tall and weigh 100 to 130 pounds.
A well-bred Dane is one of the best-natured dogs around. He"s a gentle, sweet, affectionate pet who loves to play and is relaxed with children. He has a great desire to please, which makes him easy to train. The Great Dane wants to be where the family is. He likes people a lot, including strangers and children, and will welcome visitors happily, unless he thinks you need defending. Then he can be fiercely protective. Some Danes wish they were (or truly believe they are) lapdogs, and they"ll keep trying to get there even if you and your lap mysteriously keep moving. Good-natured as they are, Great Danes definitely need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Dane puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Great Danes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Danes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. Development Issues: Growing problems can develop in puppies and young adults. These are sometimes associated with an improper diet — often a diet too high in protein, calcium, or supplements. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Great Danes. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Bone Cancer: Sometimes known as osteosarcoma, this is the most common bone tumor found in dogs. It"s usually seen in middle-aged or elderly dogs, but larger breeds such as the Great Dane tend to develop tumors at younger ages. Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign is lameness, but the dog will need X-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs. Heart Disease: Heart diseases affect Great Danes; varieties include dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve defects, tricuspid valve dysplasia, subaortic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent right aortic arch. Prognosis and treatment vary depending on the specific disorder and the dog"s age and general health. Surgery: Surgical issues are a bit different for Great Danes than for smaller dogs. For any needed surgery, find a surgeon who is experienced with giant-breed dogs. Ask for a presurgical blood test and ask them to include a clotting profile (this is not part of typical presurgical blood work). In Great Danes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Despite his giant size, a Great Dane is mellow enough to be a good housedog, though he"s not well suited to a tiny apartment because he"ll knock into everything. He can get cold in the winter, so he shouldn"t be left outside in colder climates — but then no dog should. In fact, he would enjoy having a sweater or fleece coat to keep him toasty warm when you go for a walk in a winter climate. He"s relatively quiet indoors, but he needs a long walk at least once a day, or a large yard to play in. An adult Great Dane needs 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, depending on his age and activity level. Puppies and adolescents need about 90 minutes of exercise a day. If you plan on keeping him in a yard occasionally, he"ll need a six-foot fence, though he"s not a jumper. If you"re a gardening fan understand that he really enjoys destroying the landscaping (just a little safety tip in hopes of preventing human heart attacks). While you may want a running partner, wait to take your Great Dane jogging until he"s at least 18 months old. Before then his bones are still growing, and they"re just not up to the task. In fact, he may not be ready to go jogging until he"s two. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Great Dane doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate (a really big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Dane accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Dane in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Great Danes are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Diet is important for a rapidly growing giant-breed puppy like a Great Dane, more so than for most breeds. A Great Dane puppy should never eat regular puppy food because it"s too rich for him; he needs the puppy food designed for large breeds. It"s best not to supplement with anything, especially not with calcium. Assuming a high-quality food, the amount to give your Great Dane varies greatly with age and gender. However, generalized daily amounts are: Three to six months: females, 3 to 6 cups; males, 4 to 8 cups Eight months to one year: females, 5 to 8 cups; males, 6 to 10 cups Adolescents: females, 8 cups; males, 9 to 15 cups Adults: females, 6 to 8 cups; males 8 to 10 cups Until the age of four to five months, a Great Dane puppy should have three meals per day. After that, give him two meals per day for life. He should never have only one meal per day. For more on feeding your Great Dane, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The six usual colors of Great Danes" smooth, short coats are: Fawn (a golden color with a black mask) Brindle (fawn and black intermixed all over the body in a tiger-stripe pattern) Blue (steel blue, which is really a sort of gray) Black Harlequin (white with irregular black patches over the entire body) Mantle (black and white with a solid black blanket over the body) He sheds a lot, but his coat is easy to keep in top condition with regular brushing. Use a firm bristle brush and shampoo as needed. Regular brushing keeps your Great Dane"s coat healthy and clean, and cuts down on the number of baths he needs. As you might imagine, bathing a Great Dane is a daunting task, particularly if he"s not looking forward to it. Hard to imagine him hiding under the kitchen table while trying to escape a bath, but it happens. Brush your Dane"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin getting your Dane used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Great Dane loves children and is gentle with them, especially when raised with them from puppyhood. Keep in mind he doesn"t have any idea how big he is compared to a small child, and so can accidentally knock them over quite easily. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child not to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. Generally speaking, a Great Dane will get along with other pets in the household, but occasionally some can be aggressive with livestock, or they just may not care for the other pets. It"s an individual taste: some won"t tolerate another animal in the house, while others will snooze with the cats and other dogs.
Great Danes are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Danes in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a great Dane rescue.

The Great Pyrenees was originally developed to guard flocks alongside shepherds. These days he usually works with people, often in therapy and rescue work. This is a dog who loves the sport of carting. The Great Pyrenees is an intelligent dog who is used to working on his own and figuring things out for himself. This can be a wonderful trait, but having a mind of his own can also create some training challenges. And you have to train this dog. If not, he will become completely uncontrollable — and at his full size of up to 160 pounds, you don"t want that. Since training takes lots of consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement, the Great Pyrenees is not suitable for an owner who"s reluctant to put in the necessary team. He"s worth the work, though. Calm inside the house, he somehow manages not to get underfoot, and has an amazing ability to determine friend from foe. A Pyr is courageous and devoted to his family, protecting those he loves with his life if needed. Many folks feel safer with a Great Pyrenees in their home, but it"s worth reemphasizing that he"s a dog who requires lots of socialization, starting as early as possible. If he doesn"t receive it, he can become aggressive or fearful, and he may not allow nonfamily members into your yard without (or even with) your permission. That may sound kind of cool until you stop receiving mail and your friends refuse to come over. When brought up right, he"s a social guy, and he likes to be active and to play with other dogs of any breed. He loves children, and it"s best to give him as much exposure to them as you can. Once he"s trained, you can take him to nursing homes as his size is perfect for those confined to wheelchairs. He loves going for rides in the car, but make sure the air-conditioner is on high. He"s a big fan of cool weather. Everyone who lives with a Pyr should have a set of ear plugs. He barks a lot, because that"s his job. He"ll vocalize — loudly — to ward off pesky intruders, and he"s got a broad definition of intruders. He will bark even more at night because of his extraordinary senses of sight and sound, which enable him to detect coyotes, deer, wolves, raccoons, bear, and possum (all of which must be protected against). His vocal styling will definitely scare them away and keep the family and property safe. A Pyr"s hearing is so sensitive he can detect intruders even with all the windows closed in the house; the air-conditioner, TV, and dehumidifier running on high; and the iPod playing AC/DC at full blast. He really can hear that well, and he"ll definitely let you know all about what he hears. He"ll let you know his emotions, too. Almost all Pyrs use a paw to let their people know how much they are loved. He"ll paw on your shoulder while you"re driving, on your lap while you"re eating, on your leg when a yummy treat is near (even a not-so-yummy treat). He has double dewclaws — not one dewclaw like most dogs, but two that are near each other. Don"t even think of removing them, because he uses them to climb (part of your protection services). Keep the double dews trimmed, as they can easily get caught on fences and tear easily. He"ll make himself at home on any type of furniture, including couches, beds, and chairs, even if there"s no chance he"ll fit. Never mind that detail; he"ll squeeze himself in one way or the other, even if it seems physically impossible. A Great Pyr will remind you that his comfort should be of the utmost importance to you. Who the heck do you think king-size beds are made for? The Great Pyrenees is a wonderful breed who is affectionate and gentle, hardworking and independent. He can be a devoted family companion or a conscientious career dog. His pride is evident in the regal way he carries himself. Make no mistake — he has a job to do, and he loves to do it.
The Great Pyrenees is okay in apartments because he"s mellow. But homes with large yards are better. If you want a dog you can walk off leash, this may not be the dog for you because of his independent thinking and wandering tendencies. Expect some shedding on a constant basis and at least one major shedding period per year. On the up side, the Great Pyr only requires about 30 minutes of brushing a week. A Pyr can be difficult to train because of his ability to think on his own. He"s not a good match for new or timid dog owners, because he needs consistency and a strong owner who will socialize him and train with positive reinforcement. He"s a wonderful watchdog for the family, but he needs socialization to keep from becoming shy or aggressive to both dogs and people. He thrives with his family and should live inside the house. He can become bored and destructive when separated from his family or left to live out in the backyard. A Great Pyrenees is generally loving and gentle with younger creatures, so he"s a wonderful dog for families with children. He"s a hard-core barker and is not recommended for homes where his barking can disturb others. Great Pyrenees do best in cooler climates, but don"t clip his hair during hot weather. His coat insulates him and keeps him cool, so when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun. He needs exercise, but not as much as you"d think — 20 to 30 minutes a day is fine. He has a double dewclaw that should not be removed but should be kept trimmed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The sheep-guarding Great Pyrenees originated in the Pyrenees Mountains, which form a natural border between France and Spain. He"s known by different names: Great Pyrenees in the United States and Canada, the Pyrenean Mountain Dog in the United Kingdom and most of Europe. His ancestry is believed to date back ten to eleven thousand years to dogs who originated in Asia Minor. His ancestors are thought to have come to the Pyrenees Mountains sometime around 3000 B.C. There the breed was developed to create a dog who would aid shepherds. At first, the Great Pyrenees was considered to be a dog owned by peasants. But in 1675, the Dauphin in the court of King Louis XIV declared that the Great Pyrenees was the Royal Dog of France. This prompted the French nobility to acquire Great Pyrenees and use them to guard estates. The first Great Pyrenees to be imported to North America went to Newfoundland, Canada. There the breed is attributed with creating the Landseer Newfoundlands, after crossbreedings between the Great Pyrenees and the Newfoundland. Throughout the 1800s, the breed gained popularity throughout England, Europe, and the United States. He was introduced into the St. Bernard"s breeding program in Switzerland in an effort to reestablish the numbers of dogs at the famous hospice where the St. Bernard originated. In the Pyr"s homeland, however, the breed began to deteriorate due to unscrupulous breeding practices. The two World Wars took a toll on all dog breeding; luckily several Great Pyrenees were imported to the United States before the European continent was effectively closed due to World War II. After the war, breeders began efforts to restore the breed to its former glory, and today the Great Pyrenees is a much-loved and admired dog.
The Great Pyrenees is a giant dog (both in size and heart). The average height is between 27 to 32 inches for a male and 25 to 29 inches for a female. On average, Great Pyrenees should be between 100 to 160 pounds for a male and 85 to 115 pounds for a female.
A calm, gentle, docile demeanor is the norm for a Great Pyr. Shyness, aggressiveness, and nervousness are not acceptable whatsoever, but do your part by providing tons of socialization when he"s a puppy. With training, he"s well mannered. He is gentle and can be somewhat serious. Courageous and devoted to his people, he"s the best friend anyone could ask for; he"s also a warm blanket and a comforting soul in the night. He loves being a therapy dog. He is intelligent, used to working on his own and figuring out things by himself, which means he"s an independent thinker and can be stubborn. He manages to be a good guard dog while also being friendly, calm, and gentle. Like every dog, the Great Pyr needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Pyr puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Not all Great Pyrs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Bone Care: Large-breed bones require special consideration. Treat your Great Pyr like an antique until he"s about 18 months old. His bones grow so fast that he can have growing pains, which is uncomfortable. He doesn"t fill out until he"s three or four years old. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs but can occur in large dogs as well. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Addison"s Disease: This is a serious disease also known as hypoadrenocorticism. It"s caused when the adrenal gland does not produce enough adrenal hormones, which affects the salt and potassium levels in the body. Early signs of Addison"s disease include lethargy, vomiting, and poor appetite. A severe sign can be heart arrhythmia. Treatment consists of fludrocortisone acetate or corticosteroids, and salting food. Aggressive treatments include intravenous medication. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Entropion: Entropion, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Great Pyr has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically. Anesthesia Sensitivity: This can affect dogs with a low metabolism, like the Great Pyrenees. Remind your vet of that sensitivity prior to surgery. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Great Pyrs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
A good fence around your yard is absolutely necessary, and it should be at least four feet but preferably five or six feet high. This dog is used to roaming the Pyrenees Mountains while protecting his flocks, and he needs territory. If you don"t have a fence to corral him, he"ll keep running to grasp territory. He"s a Houdini Hound who can scale fences. And if snow drifts to the height of the fence, he"ll walk right over it, so get out that shovel and move the piles away if you don"t want him visiting the neighbors during a snowstorm. (They could be surprised — it"s a bit difficult to see him approaching in the snow.) There"s a reason the Pyr rescue groups won"t adopt a Pyr to anyone without a fence, or who thinks they can just yard-train him; it"s simply not going to happen. He must have training from the time he"s a small pup, but despite his size he needs gentle, positive reinforcement. He is scarily intuitive, has impeccable manners, and a memory like an elephant: he will never, ever forget anything, which is why you always need to use a kind, gentle approach in training. Negative training makes a Pyr shy, timid, and fearful, which is problematic in any dog, much less a dog of this size. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Pyr doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate (a big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Pyr accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Pyr in a crate all day long, however. He shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Great Pyrenees are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Great Pyrenees need roughly 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day to keep him in his best condition. That"s not a lot for a dog this size. He adores cool or cold weather and loves to go for long hikes as long as it"s not hot (or even warm). He"s a big, hardy dog who can carry backpacks and gear, but don"t let him do that in the summer because he needs to be kept cool. The Great Pyrenees is an intelligent breed and can become bored a bit too easily. Provide proper stimulation with toys to prevent any destructive behavior. He enjoys being with his family and can cause household ruin if left alone for long periods. Training a Great Pyrenees can be difficult, but it can also be easy if you start early and maintain kindness and consistency. Originally bred for guarding livestock, the Pyr is used to working and thinking on his own. This trait is still strong, whether he comes from a line of pet dogs or working dogs. He needs you to establish the rules as soon as he comes into your home. If you don"t want a 100-pound dog on your couch, then the cute 20-pound fluff ball shouldn"t be allowed on the couch either. Patience is the key to training him, but remember that even after basic training you"ll never have a dog who can roam off-lead, since he will wander regardless of your cries and commands. Socialization is a must for a Great Pyr. He is bred to guard, and if he"s not properly socialized he can become aggressive or fearful. Expose your puppy to a variety of situations, including puppy classes, after he"s been properly vaccinated. Also keep him in the house with you"re the family. A dog who is left tied up outside will become aggressive, even to his owners. Leash training is also important, especially considering that your Great Pyrenees will eventually use up to 160 pounds of weight to pull you where he wants to go. Don"t let him off-leash as he will, without a doubt, roam. Leash-training will start in puppy kindergarten, and the techniques you learn there should be practiced regularly. After your Great Pyrenees has reached a level of training that you"re happy with, you can take him to many different kinds of training events and competitions, especially those that are done on-leash.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Great Pyrenees in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Great Pyr, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Great Pyrenees are considered to be average to heavy shedders, depending on the climate they live in, so expect to have white hairs on your clothes, furniture, car, and toothbrush. Despite the shedding, he"s fairly easy to groom and only requires about 30 minutes of work per week. If his silk-like hair gets dirty, it dries quickly and combs right out. Granted, he leaves white, silky dust bunnies on your floor, but if you collect it and put it outside, birds will use it for their nests — it"s a good insulator for their newborn babies. The Great Pyrenees has a double coat, the top coat and the undercoat. The top coat is long and thick and should be coarse in texture. It may be straight or slightly wavy, but it shouldn"t be curly. There should be a mane or ruff around the neck, more pronounced in males; and feathering on the back of the legs, forming a pantaloon on the back thighs. The tail should have a plume and the face and ears should have short, fine hair. The undercoat should be dense and woolly. He is white or white with markings that can be badger, tan, gray, or reddish-brown in color. The markings can appear on the head, as a mask, on the ears, on the tail, and (occasionally) on the body — but markings should never cover more than one-third of the body. The undercoat can be either shaded or white. Don"t clip the Pyr"s hair during hot weather. The coat keeps him cool, and when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun. Other than brushing, the Great Pyrenees coat requires very little care. Generally the eyebrows, whiskers, ears, hocks, feet, and forelegs are trimmed, although that"s usually for dogs showing in conformation. Baths can be infrequent (once every couple of months) since his coat tends to shed dirt. When you do bathe your Great Pyrenees, use a high-quality dog shampoo to avoid stripping oils from the dog"s coat and skin. Check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Pyr may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Pyr"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails regularly if he doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your arms from getting scratched when your Great Pyrenees enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Pyr to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Pyr loves children and is absolutely devoted to them. He"ll protect them with his life, and he is in fact tender toward everything that is small and weak. Young children can"t manage such a large dog on a leash, however, so he should be walked by an adult or an older child. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Great Pyr generally does well with other animals in the house, especially if he"s been raised with them from puppyhood. A well-socialized Pyr tends to get along with other dogs.

The handsome, alert, and powerful Greater Swiss Mountain Dog — or Swissy, as his fans call him — is relatively unknown outside of a group of dedicated enthusiasts. But if you own one of these large, striking dogs, be prepared to turn plenty of heads. Owners of the breed are often asked, "What kind of dog is that?" Topping out at well over 100 pounds, the Swissy"s size, paired with his deep, loud bark make him a good watchdog. But he"s a gentle fellow at heart, devoted to his family and loving with kids. Although he needs room to stretch his legs — this isn"t an apartment dog — he needs only a moderate amount of exercise. Originally bred to herd cattle, pull carts, and serve as a watchdog, the modern Swissy likes to have jobs to do. He excels in obedience, agility, and conformation competitions, and does well in drafting, weight pulling, herding, pack hiking, and versatility. The Swissy has also served as a therapy dog and search and rescue dog. Since he"s so large when fully grown, it"s important to start early with obedience training and socialization — teaching the dog to be friendly with other dogs and people. And be prepared for a long puppyhood: the Swissy is slow to mature, both physically and mentally, and can stay puppyish until he"s three years old. While the Swissy isn"t the right breed for everyone, those who are willing to love, train, and care for this large dog will enjoy wonderful companionship.
Due to his large size, the Swissy is not suited for apartment or condo living. A home with a fenced yard is ideal. The Swissy was bred to work and likes to have a job to do. Obedience training can give him the mental stimulation he needs, and is essential for handling a dog of this size. Although he"s generally good with kids, the Swissy is a large dog who can accidentally knock over a small child. The Swissy is prone to overheating. Keep him inside in air conditioning or in front of fans when the weather"s hot, and wait until it cools off to exercise him. Some Swiss Mountain Dogs will chase small animals. To keep the neighbor"s cat safe — as well as your dog — make sure the yard is securely fenced, and keep him on leash when you"re out and about. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is considered one of Switzerland"s oldest dog breeds. There are several theories as to the Swissy"s origins. The most popular is that he"s descended from large, Mastiff-like dogs that were brought to the Alps by invading Roman Legions. The Swissy"s ancestors served as herding, guard, and draft dogs. At one time the Swissy is thought to have been one of the most popular breeds in Switzerland. By the 1900s however, their numbers dwindled, probably because their traditional jobs on Swiss farms were taken over by other dog breeds or machines. In 1908, a canine researcher named Albert Heim spotted two dogs at a Swiss Kennel Club jubilee, listed as "short-haired Bernese Mountain Dogs." Heim recognized the dogs as being large members of the Sennenhund type, a family of four breeds that includes the Swissy. Heim lobbied to get the dogs recognized as a separate breed and, in 1909, the Swiss Kennel Club listed the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund) in the Swiss Stud Book. Since then, the breed"s popularity has grown slowly, but steadily. In 1968 the first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were brought to the U.S., and soon after, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America formed. The Swissy was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995, as a member of the Working Group.
Males stand 25.5 to 28.5 inches tall and weigh 105 to 140 pounds. Females stand 23.5 to 27 inches tall and weigh 85 to 110 pounds.
The Swissy"s personality is gentle, alert, and fun loving. These aren"t easygoing, pushover dogs, however; they"re confident canines with their own ideas, and they can be stubborn at times. Because of their bold personality, Swissy dogs do best with owners who can be kind, yet confident, leaders. This breed is alert and observant, always on the lookout for something amiss. That, plus his loud bark to alert you when he spies something out of the ordinary, makes him a good watchdog, though he"s typically not aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Swissy needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Swissy puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Swissy dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Swissy dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Swissy dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as the Swissy. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Splenic Torsion: This condition occurs when the spleen rotates, causing it to expand and become engorged with blood. The symptoms are not always obvious, but can include vomiting, fever, pale gums, and tenderness. Splenic torsion requires immediate veterinarian care and the surgical removal of the spleen is necessary. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Distichiasis: This is a condition in which extra eyelashes (cilia) grow from the glands of the upper or lower eyelid. A hair follicle develops deep within the glands rather than on the skin surface. As the hair grows, it follows the duct of the gland and exits from the gland opening along the smooth surface of the eyelid margin. In many cases, these eyelashes rub on the cornea, causing irritation and tearing, and occasionally corneal abrasions. Entropion: Entropion is an inward rolling of the eyelid. It usually affects the lower eyelid of both eyes, causing irritation and vision loss. It generally occurs before a dog turns a year old; surgery to correct the problem is usually held off until the dog reaches adulthood. Panosteitis: Commonly called Pano, this condition causes self-limiting lameness. At about five to 12 months of age, the dog may limp on one leg, then another, then it stops. There are usually no long-term effects. Rest and restricted activity may be necessary for a while if the dog"s in pain. Swissy Lick: This mysterious affliction causes the dog to start franticly licking or swallowing anything in sight. The cause is unknown, although it appears to be related to severe gastrointestinal pain. It"s treated with gas and acid-reducing medications. Swissy lick is more common among young dogs, but seniors can get it as well.
The Swissy is not suited to apartment or condo life. Because he"s a large, working dog, he needs room to roam — a home with a large, securely fenced yard is ideal. You won"t need to sign up for a marathon, though; he needs just a moderate amount of exercise. With his Swiss heritage, this breed is a natural fit for cold climates, and he loves to romp in the snow. The flips side is that he"s prone to heatstroke. Don"t let him exercise strenuously when it"s hot; during hot spells, limit your outings to cool early mornings or evenings. During the heat of the day, keep him inside with fans or air conditioning. If he has to be outside, make sure he has shade and, of course, plenty of water. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Swissy puppy. Like many large breeds, the Swissy grows rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. Keep your Swissy pup on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast. Don"t let him run and play on hard surfaces such a pavement, do a lot of jumping, or pull weights until he is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes. Like all dogs, the Swissy needs to be socialized — taught to be friendly to other dogs and people — beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten and obedience classes are a great way to socialize your Swissy and teach him good canine manners. Now, as for housetraining: while every dog is different, Swissy fans say that the breed generally takes to housetraining slowly. The reason isn"t exactly clear. But if you use crates and stick to a good housetraining routine, your Swissy will grasp the general concept of housetraining within a week or two of arriving at his new home. But don"t count on him to be completely reliable in the house until many months later.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Large-breed puppies such as the Swissy need slow, sustained growth to help prevent orthopedic problems, such as hip dysplasia. Raise them on a diet designed for large-breed dogs or food for adult dogs. Whatever diet you choose shouldn"t overemphasize protein, fat, and calorie levels: 22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat is recommended. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Swissy in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Swissy, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Swissy has a dense outer coat, about one to two inches in length, and a thick undercoat. The breed sheds minimally most of the time, with the exception of twice-yearly "blow-outs," when the undercoat comes out. The color is distinct, with a black outer coat and rust and white markings on the face and body. Grooming a Swissy isn"t terribly complicated — the short coat is easy to care for and the breed is naturally clean. Brushing once or twice a week, plus a bath as needed (usually every month or so) with a mild dog shampoo is enough to keep the Swissy looking sharp. Brush your Swissy"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Swissy to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Swissy enjoys the attention and company of youngsters if he"s given plenty of exposure to them beginning in puppyhood, and the kids are taught to treat the dog with care and respect. However, young children should never be left unsupervised with any dog. Even if the Swissy means well, this is a large, strong dog, and a Swissy can easily knock over a small child by accident. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The good-natured Swissy generally enjoys the company of other dogs and loves to play rough and rambunctious. This is especially true if he has been properly socialized with other dogs at an early age. As in any breed, dogs of the same sex who haven"t been spayed or neutered may not tolerate each another. Swissy dogs vary in their prey drive: some will chase squirrels, cats, and other small animals, and some won"t. As with any dog, you"ll have a better shot at peace among the family pets if you expose your Swissy to other animals beginning at an early age, and are careful about the introductions.
The Swissy is often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Swissy dogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Swissy rescue.

Whether or not you"ve seen one in the flesh, you know what a Greyhound looks like. The iconic hound with the aerodynamic build epitomizes speed with his narrow head, long legs, and muscular rear end. We"ve all seen images of this sprinter, if only through seeing it plastered on the side of a bus, but many of us don"t truly know the breed. One of the most ancient of breeds, Greyhounds probably originated in Egypt and have been prized throughout history. Historic figures who were captivated by this breed include Cleopatra, Queen Elizabeth I of England, and General Custer, who raced his dogs the day before he set off on his fateful trip to Little Big Horn. The patronage of the two queens led to Greyhound racing being dubbed the "Sport of Queens." Aside from its royal fans, there"s a lot to love about the breed. The Greyhound combines a stately appearance with a friendly attitude toward people and other dogs. Loyal and affectionate with his family, he"s not aggressive toward strangers, although he will let you know — through a bark or a subtle pricking of his small, folded ears — that someone"s approaching your home. Greyhounds have a reputation for high energy levels, but in reality their favorite pastime is sleeping. Designed as sprinters, not distance runners, they"ll be satisfied with a daily walk, although active people find they make good jogging or running partners. In fact, Greyhounds do fine in apartments or homes with small yards--although they need a solid fence to keep them from chasing animals they might see as prey, such as squirrels, rabbits, or trespassing cats. Regardless of their strong prey drive, there"s no doubt that this is a wonderful breed that deserves many belly rubs. Whether you bought your Greyhound from a show breeder or adopted him from the racetrack, you"ll find yourself regarding this breed with the same respect that others have given it throughout its long and glorious history.
Although a Greyhound puppy is an adorable addition to your family, many sweet adult Greyhounds are available for adoption after their racing days are over. Every year, many "retired" racing Greyhounds are abandoned, euthanized, or sold to laboratories, but they can adapt wonderfully to home life and give you many years of companionship. Before you put your name on a waiting list for a Greyhound puppy, check out the world of Greyhound rescue. Because of their thin coats, Greyhounds can get the shivers. If you live in a cold climate, buy a warm coat for your dog to wear in snow or rain. A Greyhound should never be allowed to run off leash except in a securely fenced area. Greyhounds have a strong prey drive and will take off after a rabbit or squirrel before you even see it. When Greyhounds aren"t socialized — exposed to many different people, places, and situations — they can become timid and have problems adapting to changes in schedule or environment. Take the time to socialize your dog or puppy. Greyhounds are generally a loving breed and affectionate to their people. Usually this friendliness extends to strangers, but they can be aloof with some or all strangers. Although many believe that this breed is made to run and has the destructive energy to go with it, that couldn"t be further from the truth. Greyhounds are generally docile and quiet, and they"re world-class nappers. They do well in apartments and homes with small yards because of their low indoor energy. Muzzling Greyhounds, especially retired racing Greyhounds, is a common practice. Greyhounds will nip at other dogs and can hurt smaller dogs and animals if their prey drive takes over. Many rescues recommend muzzling adopted Greyhounds, at least until they get settled into their new homes and you have a better idea of their temperament. Greyhounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog, and they require minimal grooming. The lack of a heavy coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears, and nicks. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Greyhound is an ancient breed that originated in the Middle East and North Africa and has won the admiration of many different cultures. Greyhounds have been mentioned by Greeks, depicted in art by Egyptians, praised by a Roman poet, and are the only breed of dog mentioned in the Bible. Greyhounds found their way into Europe during the Dark Ages. They were so respected for their hunting prowess that the laws of the time protected royal game reserves by forbidding anyone living within 10 miles of the king"s forests from owning a Greyhound. The Greyhound"s popularity continued to grow in England, thanks to the popularity of coursing (the sport of chasing prey) and racing. Spanish explorers and British colonists brought them to the Americas where they thrived as well, coursing jackrabbits and coyotes on the wide-open plains. The Greyhound was one of the first breeds to appear in American dog shows, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The first official coursing race took place in 1886, and the National Coursing Association in the United States was founded in 1906. Greyhound racing took off and is popular today in many states, although it"s a controversial sport because so many dogs are abandoned, euthenized, or sold to laboratories if they don"t do well at the track.
The Greyhound is a sleek, athletic dog. There are two types, which vary somewhat in size: Racing Greyhounds are usually 25 to 29 inches tall, and show Greyhounds are slightly larger, at 26 to 30 inches in height. In both types, males typically weigh 65 to 85 pounds, females 50 to 65 pounds, with racing dogs tending toward the lower end of the scale.
Greyhounds generally have a wonderful temperament, being friendly and non-aggressive, although some can be aloof toward strangers. Give them a treat, though, and they"re likely to become a friend for life. They"re intelligent and independent, even catlike in many ways. They do have a sensitive side and are quick to react to tensions in the home. They can become shy or timid with mistreatment, even if it"s unintentional. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Greyhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Greyhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Greyhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Greyhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Greyhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Greyhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs. A normal dose for any other dog of his size can kill a Greyhound, probably because of the breed"s low percentage of body fat. Choose a veterinarian who"s aware of this sensitivity and knows how to dose your Greyhound. If you can"t find a vet who"s knowledgeable about sighthounds, be sure to alert any vet who treats your dog to this sensitivity. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism involves low levels of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily thyroid medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog that"s getting daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated promptly. Usually the twist must be repaired surgically.
Greyhounds are fairly low energy dogs, but they still need and enjoy a daily walk. If they aren"t exercised regularly, they can become bored, which may lead to destructive behavior. Greyhound have an inborn drive to chase prey, and owners need a solid fence to keep their dogs from taking off after small animals. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended with this breed, as their desire to chase is far stronger than any fear of a temporary shock. Greyhounds should also be kept on leash during walks. That strong prey drive will have them ignoring commands if something interesting catches their eye. And with their speed, they can easily outdistance a distraught owner and become lost. Greyhounds can become overweight, which is bad for their health. It"s common for a retired racing Greyhound to gain roughly 5 pounds after retirement, but he shouldn"t be allowed to gain any more than that. Because he"s tall, provide him with raised feeding dishes to make dining more comfortable. Training your Greyhound, whether adopted as an adult or bought as a puppy, should begin as soon as he"s home. Greyhounds can have a stubborn streak and often approach training with a "what do I get out of it?" mentality. They"re independent and need a confident, consistent owner. However, they also have a sensitive side, which makes harsh training the worst fit for the breed. They do better with patience, consistency, and training methods that use rewards rather than punishment — they like food rewards best. Greyhounds sometimes have difficulty with the sit command as it"s not a natural position for them, and you will often see them sort of balancing on their tail. Greyhounds need to be exposed to many different people, places, and situations — a process that trainers call socialization — to prevent them from becoming timid or fearful. Many obedience schools offer socialization classes, which are also a wonderful start to obedience basics. Other ways to socialize your Greyhound include visits to dog-friendly public places and stores, walks in the neighborhood, and inviting people to your home. Introduce new social situations gradually. Greyhounds are generally easy to housetrain. Retired racing greyhounds are especially amenable to crate training and will do well as long as you keep them on a regular potty schedule.
Recommended daily amount: Males, 2.5 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; females, 1.5 to 3 cups. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Greyhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Greyhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Greyhounds have a short, smooth coat that"s easy to care for. Despite their name, they can be any color, including fawn, black, red, blue, gray, or white. They can also be various shades of brindle, a striped pattern that gives them the look of having just streaked across the African savanna, or white with at least one other color, known as particolor. Despite their short coat, Greyhounds shed. Brush them daily to keep shedding at a manageable level. Your Greyhound will love being massaged with a rubber curry brush, also known as a hound mitt. Use a dry dog shampoo when you bathe him to keep his coat clean and smelling great. Keep ears clean and free of debris with a moist cotton ball. Never insert anything into the ear canal; just clean around the outer ear. This breed"s teeth need the most dedicated care. Greyhounds tend to have poor dental health, so regular brushing is a must if you want them to have sweet breath and no ugly tartar buildup. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Greyhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Greyhounds can be patient with children and have been known to step delicately around toddlers, but they do best in homes with older children who know how to act around dogs. They"re more likely to walk away from a teasing child than to snap at him. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Although Greyhounds do very well with other dogs, they can view smaller dogs, cats, or other small pets as prey, especially if the animals run from them. Some have a much lower prey drive than others, but it"s always best to supervise your Greyhound around smaller animals. Instinct can overcome training, and Greyhounds have been known to injure or even kill smaller pets. And even if they"re best friends with your indoor cat, they may view outdoor cats that come onto their property as fair game.
Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Greyhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Greyhound rescue.

Harriers sometimes are described as "Beagles on steroids." These lively, active scent hounds were originally bred to hunt hares and foxes in large packs, but they also are wonderful family companions. Don"t expect to find one in your neighborhood, however. They are one of the rarest breeds registered with the American Kennel Club. In 1994, for example, there were only four Harrier litters born in the entire United States (resulting in only 31 puppies). Built to work, Harriers have lots of bone and substance for their size. Their muzzles are long with a well-developed nose and open nostrils. Their eyes are dark, alert, and intelligent. Speed is not as important as stamina for these dogs. Hares and foxes have been known to drop from exhaustion after being pursued by a relentless pack of Harriers. Harriers have long, dropped ears, and their feet have thick pads that enable them to run for hours through rough terrain. They have broad chests to provide lots of room for their hearts and lungs. Their tails are set high and carried upright (not curled over their backs), making it easier for hunters to see them from a distance or in thick brush. Harriers have a playful, outgoing personality. They are not quite as outgoing as the Beagle, but they definitely love to be around people and other animals. They generally are sweet-tempered and tolerant of children. You should watch them, however, around pets that aren"t dogs. Because they are pack dogs, they generally get along well with other dogs, but may see cats, hamsters, and other non-canine pets as prey. They like to live in a pack, whether the pack is made up of other dogs or people. You should always keep in mind that your Harrier is an active dog who likes to explore and track. Some like to bay (a loud, prolonged bark). You should have a well-secured fence your dog can"t jump over or crawl under, and when you take your Harrier to unsecured areas, such as a park, be sure to keep him on leash. Otherwise, he may take off, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit. Also, remember that Harriers were bred to have a lot of energy and stamina, as well as to think for themselves. They are independent and tireless hunters. These traits, while good for hunting, may present difficulties in training. You"ll need to provide them with enough exercise to keep them from becoming bored and destructive. These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn"t mean getting into mischief! Because they are independent thinkers who can sometimes be stubborn, you should strongly consider obedience training for your Harrier. Because these dogs have great stamina and are energetic without being hyperactive, they do well in performance sports such as agility and rally. They also make great jogging, bicycling, and hiking companions. Although they are relatively inactive in the house, they are not recommended for apartment dwellers unless you are willing to provide them with a great deal of outside exercise every day. Harriers make good watchdogs because they will alert you to any strange noises or visitors to your home. However, don"t expect them to be guard dogs. They are so friendly that they often greet strangers as though they were old friends. Although they are sweet, even-tempered dogs, Harriers are not recommended for first-time dog owners because of their training and exercise needs.
Some Harriers can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. Harriers tend to be vocal and some love to howl. Some Harriers like to dig and have been known to dig under fences to escape and chase after something. Harriers are hunting dogs and will take any opportunity to pursue game or follow a scent. A secure fence is a necessity if you have a Harrier. Underground electronic fences are not effective with Harriers because they have a high pain threshold and the brief shock they get from crossing the invisible line does not deter them from chasing or investigating things beyond its boundaries. Harriers are high-energy dogs and have a great deal of stamina. They are perfect for active families or athletic people who like to jog or bicycle with their dogs alongside (on leash so they don"t take off on a chase), but they may become obese or destructive if living in a more sedentary home. If not properly trained and socialized, your Harrier may see cats and other small furry animals as prey and act accordingly. Harriers are good watchdogs who will bark if they feel that someone or something is threatening their territory, but they are not good guard dogs. After raising the alarm, they are likely to greet strangers as long-lost friends. Harriers can stay outdoors if given adequate shelter from the heat and cold, but being pack animals, they are at their best when they are around other dogs or their family. The Harrier"s long ears prevent adequate air circulation to their ears and they may be prone to ear infections. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
There are several conflicting stories about how the Harrier breed came to be. The word Harrier was Norman French and meant hound or dog. With that connection, the best guess may be that the earliest Harrier-type dogs descended from a cross of Bloodhounds, Talbot hounds, and perhaps even Basset Hounds, all of which had their origins in what are now France and Belgium. In England, where the Harrier breed was developed, a pack of Harrier-type dogs was established as early as 1260 — more than 800 years ago! The Penistone pack, established by Sir Elias Midhope, existed for at least 500 years, well into the 18th century. Originally, these packs were used to hunt hare with the hunters following on foot, so at that time, they were a much slower and more methodical type of hound than today"s Harriers. When foxhunting became fashionable with the hunters on horses, Harriers were adapted to have more speed. The Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed in England in March 1891. At that time, Harriers were much more popular than Beagles. The 1891-1900 volumes of the AMHB"s Stud Book list 107 registered packs of Harriers. Admission into the Stud Book in those days was based on the records of the pack owner or by committee. It appears that many of the foundation Harriers were in fact small Foxhounds. Additionally the names of some of these foundation Harriers appear in the pedigrees of top-winning Beagles. From this, it"s surmised that the name "Harrier" was used to describe the type of hunting and size of the hound rather than its pedigree. Interestingly, although Harriers are recognized by the American Kennel Club, the Canadian Kennel Club, and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (the world canine club), as well as others, England"s Kennel Club hasn"t recognized the Harrier breed since 1971. The last time Harriers were shown at a Kennel Club show or entered in their Stud Book was in 1915. The reason for this could be that in England, Harriers are only owned by hunting organizations and are registered with the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles. They usually are registered with the AMHB only if they are a member of a pack and have been used for at least one hunting season. There are reports of Harriers being imported to the U.S. as early as the 1700s. Several packs of Harriers were established and some were recognized by the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America. At least two American packs were listed in the AMHB in England. Although they are great family companions, Harriers have never been a popular breed. From 1884 to 1994, only 949 Harriers have been registered with the American Kennel Club. Although they"ve always ranked at or near the bottom of the list in popularity, 182 Harriers have become AKC Champions of Record, which is a very high percentage of champions to dogs registered. Despite their lack of popularity, they have been a part of the American Kennel Club since its beginnings, being the 13th breed recognized by the AKC, and the 4th Hound breed recognized. Two Harriers from Baltimore, Maryland, were entered at the first Westminster Kennel Club Show in 1877. Four Harriers from New York were entered in the second Westminster show. Registrations of Harriers were few and far between in the early 1900s. In 1936, a dog named Monarch became the first Harrier Champion of Record and also the first Harrier to win Best in Show. Monarch was owned by the Monmouth County Hunt, and bred from dogs imported from England. There were several Harrier packs in the US through the early years of the 20th Century. George S. Patton, who was at the time a Colonel, was Master of the Cobbler Harriers from 1936 to 1938. From 1940 to 1958, no Harriers were registered with the AKC, although some were registered with the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America. As in England, most Harriers in the U.S. have historically belonged to hunting packs and aren"t registered with the AKC. A few Harriers started being shown in AKC shows in the early 1960s. In 1965, Breezewood Chop Chop became the second AKC Champion after a gap of 30 years. In 1969, a Harrier named Naabeehos Harvey won Best in Show at Superstition KC, and earned 5 points towards his championship. In 1970, Lady Elizabeth of Byron Mewes and Johnson"s Pretty Boy Floyd were presented Best in Show honors. In 1978, Brentcliffe Jill won her first Best in Show and went on to become the all-time top-winning Harrier with 17 Best in Shows and 52 Hound Group wins. While most Harriers in the U.S. are family companions, some are also used to hunt rabbit and game that is too fast for most Beagles.
Harriers are medium-size dogs. They stand between 19 and 21 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
As a typical pack hound — a dog that"s used to working as part of a group — the gentle Harrier is outgoing and friendly, never aggressive toward other dogs. He"s also a typical hound in that he"s an independent thinker and can be stubborn. It"s important to train him using methods that will persuade him that being obedient is his idea. Positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior — is the way to go with this breed. He"s a good watchdog and will alert you to strange sounds or the approach of people. If you"re not home, he"ll watch the burglar come in and cart off your silver. Like every dog, Harriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Harrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Harriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Harriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Harriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Harriers have a lot of energy and stamina. They are great companions if they get enough exercise, but if not, they may become destructive. Harriers are not recommended for apartment dwellers. They do best in homes that have large yards or acreage for them to run. Yards need fences that your Harrier can"t dig under or jump over. Harriers can live outside with proper shelter from the heat and cold, but prefer to be indoors, close to their family, whom they consider their pack. Harriers bay — a prolonged bark — when they"re bored or lonely, so it"s not a good idea to leave them alone in the backyard for hours at a time, especially if you have neighbors nearby. These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn"t mean getting into mischief! Give your adult Harrier a long walk with lots of time for sniffing or take him jogging every day. Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Harrier pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies can eat as much as 4 cups a day, divided into three meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. More important than the amount of food your Harrier gets is his overall condition. He should look muscular, not fat. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye exam and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. He should have a visible waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can"t feel the last two ribs, he needs less food and more exercise. If you can see his ribs, feed more. For more on feeding your Harrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Harriers have short, thick, shiny coats, and very soft ears. They can come in a wide variety of colors, but the most common colors seen in the U.S. are tri-colors (black, tan and white), and red and white. They resemble an English Foxhound, only smaller. The Harrier coat is easy to groom. Give him a weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush or hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand. Harriers shed a moderate amount, but regular brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. Check his long ears for foreign objects such as foxtails or burrs, especially if he"s been running out in the fields. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, it"s a good idea to clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Harrier may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Harrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Harrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Harrier accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Harrier is described as being excellent with children. As with all breeds, that comes with some qualifications. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Being pack dogs, Harriers enjoy the company of other dogs, whether or not they"re Harriers. They may view smaller animals, including cats, as prey, however. If they weren"t brought up with them from puppyhood, closely supervise their interactions with cats and other pets.

The Havanese shines his affectionate personality on everyone, including strangers, children, other dogs, and even cats. But his family will get the lion"s share of his love; given the choice, he"ll stick like glue to his owner"s side. The potential downside to all this devotion is that, when left alone, the Havanese can become anxious. This is definitely a housedog, and a Havanese who"s left in the backyard — or anywhere away from his family — is not a happy dog. His Velcro personality isn"t so surprising, considering he was bred to keep the wealthy families of his native island of Cuba company. Since then, however, the Havanese has proven that he"s good for much more than warming laps. Havanese dogs are quite trainable, and they"ve worked as therapy and assistance dogs, sniffed out mold and termites, and shown off their clownish antics as performing dogs. They"ve also got a surprising amount of energy for their size, and for the family looking to compete, the Havanese will happily tackle such sports as agility, freestyle, obedience, and flyball. As with many small dogs, it"s common for adoring owners to overindulge their Havanese. They"ll probably regret it — bad habits, such as eating only people food, can form very quickly. This breed is a sharp con artist, and you may find that your Havanese is training you, rather than the other way around. In spite of his quirks, or maybe even because of them, the Havanese is a wonderful and versatile pet.
The Havanese is a companion dog that thrives on being with his family. He can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone, and does best when someone is home during the day to keep him company. Although they generally outgrow this, it"s quite common for Havanese puppies (among other breeds) to eat their own stools. Scoop your puppy"s poop right away so he can"t indulge in this icky habit. The long, silky coat of the Havanese is beautiful, but requires regular brushing and care. Many owners prefer to clip it short, but if you want to show your dog, you"ll have to let it grow long and invest a good amount of time in grooming, or money in paying a groomer. Another reason to keep it long: If you live in a warm climate, the long coat helps keep your dog cool. The Havanese does well in all types of housing, from apartments to homes with large yards. But he"ll probably bark when he sees someone passing by the house or when he hears a strange noise. The good news is that he doesn"t bark just for the sake of hearing his own voice. The Havanese loves to watch the world from up high, and will find his way onto the backs of sofas and tables to watch the day pass by. Paper is a favorite toy for the Havanese, and this clever little breed will go out of his way to find it, even sniffing through the jackets of your guests. Toilet paper, which can give him hours of shredding pleasure, is a special treat. Toss him a roll, and your house will soon look like it"s been hit by Halloween pranksters. The Havanese needs as much exercise as a larger dog. A long walk or an active game each day should do it. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
After Columbus claimed Cuba for Spain in 1492, Spanish settlers began arriving on the island. With them came their small companion dogs — the ancestors of what"s now the Bichon family of dogs. These dogs interbred and — isolated from other dogs by island life, and later, by trade restrictions imposed on Cuba by Spain — they began to develop into the Havanese we know today. Their signature coat was thick and silky, which helped insulate the dog from the tropical sun (the coat is like raw silk floss, profuse, but extremely light and soft, and insulates against the tropical rays in much the same way that yards of silk sari protect the women of India). By the early 1800s, Havanese were gracing the laps of many aristocratic families in Cuba. European travelers who became enamored with the breed brought dogs back to England, Spain, and France. The breed became trendy in Europe in the mid-1800s, and Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens were among his well-known fans at the time. Like most breed trends, this one petered out. At one point the Havanese became almost extinct, even in his native Cuba. A few Cuban families still bred and kept the dogs, however, and with the Cuban Revolution in 1959, 11 Havanese were brought to the U.S. in the arms of their owners. These canine refugees are the ancestors of most of the Havanese outside of Cuba today. The renaissance of the breed began in the 1970s,when an American couple who bred dogs found a few descendents of the 11 dogs who were brought from Cuba. Charmed by their intelligence and affectionate nature, they began tracking down other Havanese and working to reestablish the breed. Because most Havanese outside of Cuba today can trace their ancestry to just 11 dogs, breeders are working to widen the gene pools of the American-bred Havanese. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1995.
Males and females stand 8 1/2 to 11 1/2 inches tall, and weigh 7 to 13 pounds.
The Havanese is a gentle and affectionate breed that thrives on human companionship. Your Havanese will often follow you from room to room throughout the day, and he can get very anxious when left alone. He"s intelligent as well, and will enjoy making you laugh with goofy antics, or simply sitting on your lap watching the world go by. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Havanese needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Havanese puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Havanese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Havanese will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Havanese, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds of dogs. Although it"s a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can show up in a puppy born to parents free of the disease. Treatments include medication, weight loss if the dog is overweight, nutritional supplements, and sometimes surgery. Elbow Dysplasia: Elbow dysplasia is similar to hip dysplasia; it"s a degenerative disease that affects the elbow joint. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, causing the joint to be malformed and weakened. The disease varies in severity; some dogs only develop a little stiffness, others become lame. The treatment is surgery, weight management, and medication. Chondrodysplasia: This is a genetic disorder that"s commonly mislabeled as "dwarfism." Affected dogs have abnormally short limbs for the breed. This can range in severity from nearly normal to crippling. In less severe cases, dogs can live full and healthy lives, but any dog with this disorder should not be bred. Legg-Perthes Disease: Legg-perthes causes a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone, until the bone eventually dies off, collapses, and becomes deformed. The result is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It"s unclear what causes legg-perthes, but it may be inherited or injury related. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Dogs generally do well after the surgery, and many suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes. Cataracts: A cataract is opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes vision loss. The affected eye has a cloudy appearance. It is an inherited disease and usually occurs with old age, but can occur at any age. Cataracts are treated by surgical removal. Deafness: Deafness provides many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but deafness usually cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many products on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you both. Patellar Luxation: Also known as a "trick knee," patellar luxation is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patellia, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness or an abnormal gait. Treatment for patellar luxation is usually surgery. Portosystemic Shunt: A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal blood flow where the blood from the digestive tract bypasses the liver and continues to the systemic venous circulation. When this occurs, toxins that are normally removed by the liver are circulated through the body leading to other diseases, such as hepatic encephalopath. Portosystemic shunts usually occur in conjunction with another disease and symptoms include poor balance, loss of appetite, lethargy, blindness, depression, weakness, seizures, disorientation, and coma. A change in diet and surgery can help treat the problem. Heart Murmur: A disturbance in the blood flow is the cause of heart murmurs. There are five grades of heart murmurs; they are graded on how audible the murmur is. Heart murmurs are an indicator of disease; treatment is necessary, which can include medication, special diet, and exercise restrictions. Mitral Valve Insufficiency: Mitral valve insufficiency is more commonly seen in older dogs when the mitral valve, which is found between the left atrium and ventricle, begins to fail. When this happens, the mitral valve fails to prevent the flow of blood into the left atrium. This can cause heart failure. Symptoms include hypertension, fluid in the lungs, and a decrease in strength of the heart muscle. Treatment includes medication, change of diet, and exercise restrictions.
Although the Havanese is a small breed, he has a fair amount of energy to burn. A lengthy walk or an active game of fetch each day will keep him happy. The Havanese does well in a variety of homes, from apartments to large homes with yards — as long as he"s an indoor dog. This breed isn"t suited for life in the backyard. He is happiest when he is with his family. Although they"re not overly yappy, they do bark at passersby, so if your home has noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you. His eagerness to please his owners makes the Havanese fairly easy to train in most cases. Basic obedience, beginning with puppy classes, is recommended. Housetraining, however, can be particularly challenging for a Havanese, so you"ll need to be especially patient during this process. You"ll get there, but crate training is a must. Separation anxiety can be a serious concern for the Havanese and his owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don"t leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied. Though he"s small and fuzzy, a Havanese isn"t a toy. Like all breeds, he needs to learn good canine manners. Don"t spoil him with table scraps or by carrying him all the time he"ll get fat or become overly possessive of you.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Havanese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Havanese, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Havanese coat is thick but silky, soft, and light, and it doesn"t shed easily. The coat is long and ranges from straight to curly, although wavy is considered the ideal for the show ring. It comes in white, black, black and tan, sable, gray, and a myriad of other colors and markings. Many owners clip the Havanese coat short to make it easier to care for. But if you show your Havanese — or just want to look like you do — you"ll have to keep it long, and should expect to do a lot of grooming. When kept long, the coat needs daily brushing to prevent mats from forming, and frequent baths to keep it clean. In general, it"s wise to keep the hair above the eyes tied up to prevent irritation — it looks cute, too. Unless you"re highly motivated and skilled, you"re probably better off with a professional groomer. Owners can learn to groom their dogs, but it takes a dedicated person to keep this breed"s coat in good shape. Watery eyes and resulting tearstains are common in the Havanese. Keep in mind that excessive tearing can signal an eye problem and should be checked by a veterinarian. However, most tearstains are not serious, and the cause is simply unknown. You can improve the stained look by keeping the hair around the eyes clean (wipe daily with a damp cloth). There are whitening products on the market made specifically for lightening the stains, which some owners find helpful. Brush your Havanese"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Havanese enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Havanese to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Havanese is an excellent family dog who"s affectionate with everyone, including kids of all ages and other dogs and pets. But because he"s so small, he could easily get hurt by accident, so it"s especially important to teach kids how to treat the dog. You should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Havanese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Havanese in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Havanese rescue.

He comes from the trendy Spanish island of Ibiza, but the elegant Ibizan Hound is a canine classic whose history dates to the time of the pharaohs of Egypt. The beautiful red and white dog has a long, narrow head that resembles that of the Egyptian jackal god Anubis, large, erect ears that can point forward, sideways, or be folded backward, and flesh-colored pigment on the nose and eye rims, all of which combine to give him a unique appearance. More important is the wonderful personality that shines through. The Ibizan Hound, nicknamed Beezer by his fans, is playful and sometimes silly. He"s not a touchy-feely dog, but he enjoys snuggling with members of his family. The Ibizan can be reserved with strangers and protective of his home, but he should never be shy or aggressive. A medium-size sighthound who was developed to hunt rabbits and other small game, he was bred for speed, stamina, and determination. Today, those talents make this athletic dog a match for some of the top coursing breeds, as well as an excellent competitor in agility, thanks to his ability to jump high and far. Ibizan Hounds enjoy their comforts — that sleek, sculpted body needs cushioning, after all — and can become couch potatoes who enjoy spending their days sleeping. Their exercise needs are moderate. They"ll enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute walks or jogs daily. Whenever possible, give them a chance to run full out in a large, safely fenced area. Their ability to jump high from a standstill makes Ibizans notorious as counter surfers. Never trust them alone with food, no matter how out of the way you think it is. Outdoors, protect them with a secure fence that"s at least six feet high. Ibizans cannot be trusted off-leash unless they are in a fenced yard. They have a strong prey drive and will chase anything that moves quickly. For this reason, they"re not suited to families who have pets such as rabbits, although they get along fine with other dogs and can learn to live with cats if they"re raised with them. The Ibizan Hound comes in two coat types, shorthaired and wirehaired, and both are easy to maintain. Regardless of whether you want to compete or simply want a wonderful companion, this could be the breed for you. An Ibizan will walk or run with you, love you, and always make you laugh.
Ibizan Hounds do well in apartments if they are properly exercised. They must be kept on leash whenever they are not in a securely fenced area. Beezers have a strong prey drive and will pursue moving objects heedless of your commands. Ibizan Hounds are excellent jumpers. It takes at least a 6-foot fence to confine them to a yard. Underground electronic fences are not recommended for this breed. Beezers need daily exercise. If their exercise requirements are not met, they can become bored and destructive. Male Ibizan Hounds may develop poor appetites when they are adolescents. Encourage them to eat, but don"t go overboard with food bribes, elaborate meals, or hand feeding; you"ll simply end up with a picky eater. Beezers become cold easily. If you live in a cold or wet climate, purchase a coat for your dog. Ibizan Hounds are excellent with children, but all dogs should be supervised when they are with young children. These dogs are generally quiet indoors and can become couch potatoes but they need a daily walk or run. Ibizan Hounds are expert counter surfers so don"t leave food out, even if you think it"s out of your dog"s reach. Ibizan Hounds are generally not aggressive but they do have a high prey drive and are not best suited for homes with small animals. They can learn to get along with cats if they"re raised with them, but outdoor cats and other animals are fair game. Ibizan Hounds are a rare breed. Expect to spend time on a waiting list if you"re interested in one of these dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
When King Tut"s tomb was opened in 1922, one of the treasures found inside it was a life-size statue of the jackal god Anubis, the Watchdog of the Dead, and the resemblance to the modern Ibizan Hound was striking. The carving and other artifacts from the time of the pharaohs suggest that dogs like the Ibizan Hound have existed for 5,000 years, making them one of the most ancient types of dogs. Turns out that supposition probably isn"t correct, though. Genetic research has shown that the modern-day Ibizan, as well as his cousin, the Pharaoh Hound, are recent reconstructions of an older type and don"t actually have a lineage that stretches back thousands of years. The age of the Ibizan aside, how did this type of dog end up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, from which he takes his name? The Phoenicians, the most adventurous and well-traveled traders of the time, may have taken him there in the 8th or 9th century BCE. On Ibiza, the lithe and speedy hound traversed rough terrain, using his splendid sight and hearing to seek out his prey: rabbits and hares. Ibizans lived a harsh life on their Spanish island, a life that shaped them to hunt with skill, tenacity, and patience. They might have remained there, little known, but for the importation of a pair, Hannibal and Certera, by Colonel and Mrs. Consuelo Seoane to Rhode Island in 1956. They produced the first American litter of eight puppies which, along with several other imports, became the foundation of the breed in the United States. The Ibizan Hound was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1979 and first appeared at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1980. He remains a rare breed today. The Ibizan Hound ranks 138th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
A male Ibizan Hound stands 23.5 to 27.5 inches and weighs 50 pounds; a female is 22.5 to 26 inches and 45 pounds.
The lively Ibizan is attracted by anything that moves and will run after cats, rabbits, or anything else that looks like it might be fun to chase. His large, mobile ears are indicative of his super sense of hearing, which makes him an excellent watchdog. He might not bark an alarm, but if you see those ears twitching, you"ll know something or someone is around. With his family, the Ibizan is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. He may be reserved at first with strangers, but he should never be shy or aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Ibizan Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Ibizan puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Ibizan Hounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Beezers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Beezers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Seizures: Seizures can have a number of causes. They can be hereditary; they can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or they can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Ibizan Hound has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Axonal Dystrophy: Axonal Dystrophy is a rare neurological disorder that is seen occasionally in Ibizan Hounds. It affects young puppies. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Deafness: Deafness can affect one or both ears. Puppies and adults can be tested to verify that their hearing is sound. If your Ibizan has hearing loss, he"ll require special training techniques, as well as extra patience. Aids such as vibrating collars can help. Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Veterinary ophthalmologists can determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Cases can range from mild to severe. Retinal dysplasia shouldn"t affect a dog"s ability to function as a companion, but affected dogs shouldn"t be bred.
With their quiet nature and moderate exercise needs, Ibizans are suited to most living situations, from condos to homes with yards, as long you can provide them with a couple of daily walks or runs. They aren"t trustworthy off leash, however, and should never be allowed to run free except in a safely fenced area. An Ibizan is an excellent jumper and should be confined by a fence that"s at least six feet high. Don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep him in your yard; the desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock. An Ibizan is an excellent walking or jogging companion and will enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute outings daily. He"ll appreciate any opportunity to run free, although he may take advantage of it for only a few minutes. Be careful not to exercise puppies too much until they reach maturity. The general rule is 5 minutes for every month of age; i.e. a 5-month-old puppy should receive no more than 25 minutes of exercise per day. Train your Beezer with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Hounds in general weren"t created to work closely with people, so they need short, fun training sessions that will hold their interest. Ibizan Hounds are intelligent and can learn quickly, but they"ll become bored if training is repetitive. If you train your Ibizan correctly, he"ll be an eager, enthusiastic student, but if your teaching methods are harsh or boring, this sensitive dog will refuse to respond to you. Ibizans aren"t difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, however, as an aid to housetraining and to prevent your Ibizan puppy or adolescent from getting into mischief when you"re not around to supervise. Remember that he has a slender body with little fat for padding and provide a cushion for his crate. Otherwise, your Ibizan may find his quarters uncomfortable.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Ibizan Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Beezer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Ibizan Hound can have a coat that"s shorthaired or wirehaired. The wirehaired coat can be one to three inches long, with the longest hair on the back, the back of the thighs, and the tail. He may sport a moustache on his muzzle. Whether he has a short or wire coat, the Beezer"s hair is hard to the touch. Ibizans can be white, red (ranging from a light yellow-red called lion to a deep red), or red and white. Don"t be taken aback by his pigmentation. His nose and eye rims are supposed to be flesh-colored, not black. It"s easy to groom an Ibizan, no matter which type of coat he has. Brush him weekly to remove loose hair and keep his coat shiny and skin healthy. You can brush him more often if you want to reduce the amount of hair he sheds. Bathe only as needed. Brush your Beezer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Ibizan enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Ibizan to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Because they"re so playful and silly, Ibizans are good with children. They can be gentle but may chase young children who are running around. They"re probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Ibizans enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats, if they"re introduced at an early age. Your housecat will fare best with an Ibizan if he"s the type to stand his ground rather than run. Cats or other animals that wander into their yard are fair game, however.

It"s thought that invading Vikings brought the ancestors of this breed with them to Iceland in the ninth century. Thanks to the isolation of Iceland, today"s Icelandic Sheepdogs — also called the Icelandic Spitz or Icelandic Dog — probably look a lot like their ancestors. For centuries the Icelandic Sheepdog was used to protect flocks, especially lambs, from birds of prey, and to this day he retains the habit of watching the sky and barking at birds. He also barks to alert his family to anything and everything that he sees or hears. He"s too friendly to be much of a guard dog, but you"ll never be surprised by visitors. Affectionate, confident, and playful, the Icelandic Sheepdog gets along well with people and other dogs. Males tend to be more laidback and cuddly than females. Trained with consistency and patience, Icelandics learn quickly and willingly.

Early Irish Setters came in red or red and white, but eventually breeders began to focus only on the red varieties, and the red-and-white setters almost disappeared. They were saved from extinction, however, and now they"re considered a separate breed from their Irish Setter cousins. As gundogs, they take their own sweet time in learning their duties, but eventually become loyal and reliable hunters. They display a strong zest for life and make great friends for kids who are big enough to stand up to their rambunctious play. Give them a home with lots of room to run, and be prepared to train them with patience and consistency.

Who says blondes have more fun? Any self-respecting Irish Setter would dispute that claim. These fun-loving dogs are tremendously likeable, not only for their flame-colored hair, but also for their athleticism, grace, and enthusiasm. When you live with an Irish Setter, you can be assured of having a happy, friendly companion who"s always ready to rock and roll. Originally developed as a bird dog, the Irish Setter retains the drive and energy of his forefathers. There"s nothing he enjoys more than doing new things and going new places, especially if they involve birds. Although he"s not seen as much in the field as some other sporting breeds, his hunting instinct is still strong. Once he"s trained on birds, he never needs a refresher course. While the Irish Setter loves everyone, he"s not suited to every home. He"s brimming with energy and requires a minimum of an hour of exercise daily. A large fenced yard or acreage where he can run is important, as is an active family who will include him in everything they do. He can develop separation anxiety or become destructive if he"s left to his own devices. Irish Setters come in two types: show and field dogs. Irish Setter show dogs are heavier and larger than field dogs, with a heavier, thicker coat. Both types meet the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look and act. Regardless of size and coat, the Irish Setter should maintain his natural ability to be a gundog. Beyond their talents in the field, Irish Setters excel at many other activities, including obedience, rally, tracking, and agility competition. With their wonderful temperaments, they make terrific therapy dogs and can be found visiting hospices, retirement homes, and children"s hospitals, spreading the gift of their warmth, humor, and love. Irish Setters are known for their intelligence, but they"re also mischievous and independent. Training them requires much patience and consistency. This breed is slow to mature, so you"ll have a full-grown dog with puppylike enthusiasm and activity levels for several years. Not surprisingly, they"re great playmates for active older children, but they can be overwhelming for toddlers, who may find themselves bowled over by this rascally redhead. The Irish Setter has been loved by movie stars, presidents, and ordinary people who admire him for his joyful spirit. He"s a wonderful companion who will keep you fit and make you laugh throughout your life.
Irish Setters become very attached to the people in their lives and can suffer from serious separation anxiety. They become very unhappy when they are left alone for more than a few hours and this unhappiness usually results in destructive behavior. Irish Setters do not make good outdoor dogs and need to stay inside, close to their family. The high-energy, athletic Irish Setter needs room to run and the best place for him to do that is in a large, fenced yard. Irish Setters need lots of exercise and should be exercised twice a day for at least half an hour each time. Irish Setters need obedience training to channel their mischievous and sometimes stubborn nature. Irish Setters do very well with other animals and children. It is important, however, to properly socialize your puppy regardless of the breed"s temperament or your living situation. You might not have children or other pets now, but that could change. Lack of socialization can cause many difficulties. Irish Setters need to be groomed daily or every other day to keep their long, silky coats from becoming tangled. They are moderate shedders, so you will have some hair in your house, especially during shedding seasons. Irish Setters do not mature quickly. Some dogs settle down by the age of 2, but others remain puppylike their entire lives. Irish Setters are inquisitive by nature and will get into anything they can find or reach. This trait can also make training more difficult because they generally have a hard time staying focused. If you can keep them interested in training, they learn quickly. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
It"s not surprising that this handsome redhead comes from Ireland, which is famous for fine and beautiful dogs. The Irish Setter appears to have been developed there in the 18th century, probably the result of combining English Setters, spaniels, pointers, and Gordon Setters. Those first Irish Setters were sometimes called red spaniels — a clue to their heritage, perhaps — or modder rhu, Gaelic for "red dog." Often, they were white and red instead of the solid dark red we see today. Some, described as "shower of hail" dogs, had red coats sprinkled with small white spots. The Irish Earl of Enniskillen may have started the fad for solid red dogs. By 1812, he would have no other kind in his kennels. Other Irish breeders of the time who preferred the red dogs were Jason Hazzard of Timaskea in County Fermanagh and Sir St. George Gore. A dog named Elcho was the first Irish Setter imported to the United States. He arrived in 1875 and became a star not only in the show ring but also in the field. The first Irish Setter registered by the American Kennel Club was Admiral, in 1878. They quickly became one of the most popular breeds in America and a favorite in the show ring. Between 1874 and 1948, 760 Irish Setters became conformation champions, while only five became field champions. This sparked alarm for some fanciers of the original breed, and in 1940 the magazine Field and Stream called for a resurrection of the breed as a working dog. Today, it"s not unusual to see two types: the larger, heavier show dog, and the lighter, sleeker field dog. The Irish Setter"s popularity soared in the 1960s and 1970s, thanks to the books and movie featuring an Irish Setter named Big Red, as well as the presence of Irish Setter King Timahoe at the White House during the Nixon administration. Today, the Irish Setter ranks 68th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
The typical male Irish Setter stands 27 inches at the shoulder and weighs 70 pounds; females are 25 inches and weigh 60 pounds.
The Irish Setter is fun-loving, playful, and affectionate, always ready for a rollicking good time. He can be mischievous and isn"t above raiding your underwear drawer and prancing into the living room bearing a leopard-print thong in his teeth — while guests are there, natch. Irish Setters are outgoing and love people. They aren"t really guard dogs, although they"ve been known to step in and protect their people as needed. They are, however, excellent watchdogs and will bark to let you know of visitors or intruders. Irish Setters are slow to mature and will retain their puppy enthusiasm for several years and often throughout their life. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Irish Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Canine Leukocyte (CAD): Canine Leukocyte is an inherited abnormality that affects the white blood cells ability to fight infection. This disease impairs the immune system and is found in Irish Setters. Dogs who have this disease will suffer from immunological complications and reoccurring infections. Breeders are currently trying to remove Canine Leukocyte from their breeding lines and there is a DNA test that can be done to show that a dog is free of the gene. It is important to ask your potential breeder if their dogs have been screened for CLAD. Epilepsy: The Irish Setter can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Irish Setter has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. A new DNA test for PRA will help to reduce the incidence of this disease in the breed. Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD): Hypertrophic osteodystrophy, which causes lameness and is linked to excessive levels of protein and calcium in the diet, may affect puppies between 4 and 8 months of age. Besides lameness, signs include fever, appetite loss, swollen joints, lethargy, and reluctance to walk. It can occasionally be fatal. HOD can be difficult to diagnose, so make sure your veterinarian is aware that the condition can affect Irish Setters. It"s treated with a course of steroids, antibiotics, and pain relievers. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Panosteitis: Panosteitis is a disease that affects the bones, especially the limb bones, of primarily young large breed dogs. A lameness in one or more leg is the result of inflammation in the bone. The disease usually lasts from 1 to 6 months and the dog will go through periods of pain and periods of good health. There is no treatment but it is managed with anti-inflammatories and pain relievers.
The best home for an Irish Setter is one with a large fenced yard or acreage. This breed needs room to run. He is a hunting dog, so he must be contained by a fence or restrained by a leash to prevent him from wandering off. He should live indoors with his family, never alone in a kennel or backyard. Irish Setters need at least an hour of exercise daily. This can be done in a variety of different ways, but one of the best ways is to allow the Irish Setter to run. He"s a great jogging companion and will also enjoy running alongside a bicycle. Long walks, playing fetch, swimming, and of course hunting are other excellent ways to exercise your Irish Setter. Irish Setter puppies have different exercise needs. From 8 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Irish Setter pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile, run on soft surfaces such as grass or dirt, and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Irish Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force. Training an Irish Setter is primarily a matter of preventing boredom on his part. He tends to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Help him focus by keeping him entertained. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and avoid repetitive exercises. Switch rewards and activities frequently to retain his interest. He accepts fair corrections good-naturedly. Crate training is a must for your Irish Setter puppy. This breed is curious and will examine anything and everything with his mouth. A crate will help keep your puppy and your belongings safe when you aren"t around to supervise. Most Irish Setters are easy to housetrain. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Irish Setter puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he"s 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it"s important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Irish Setter in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Setter, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
His beautiful coat is one of the characteristics that give the Irish Setter his reputation as one of the most beautiful breeds in the dog world. Short and fine on the head and forelegs, the burnished mahogany or rich chestnut red coat is moderately long and straight on the rest of the body, with long, silky feathering on the ears, the backs of the forelegs and thighs, and the tail, and a fringe of hair on the belly and chest. In the show ring, Irish Setters are trimmed to emphasize the lean head and clean neck and to show the natural outline of the foot. Brush your Irish Setter at least every other day to keep his coat shiny and tangle-free. Check for burrs and other debris any time he"s been out in the field or on a hike. Unless he rolls in something stinky, he shouldn"t need a bath more than a couple of times a year, as long as you keep him well brushed. You can bathe him more frequently if you want, however, and you"ll need to if you plan to show him. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his coat and skin. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Irish Setter"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Irish Setter may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Irish Setter"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Irish Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Irish Setter to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Setters are good friends for active older children, but they can be too rambunctious for toddlers. It"s all too easy for an Irish Setter to accidentally knock a child down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Setters are also good with other dogs in the household, as well as cats, especially if they"re raised with them, but they might see pet birds as prey since those are what they are bred to hunt.

The Irish Terrier"s motto is "No fear." Nicknamed "Daredevil," this medium-size, agile dog has a tight, wiry red coat and a snootful of courage. He"s animated and loyal, always on guard, and willing to take on anything that comes his way and threatens his people and home. With that tough terrier attitude, however, comes a need for training and socialization from an early age. Irish Terriers are extremely intelligent and learn easily, but any training must work around their independent, willful spirit. If you can make the dog think that training is his idea, you"ll get a happy worker who meets or exceeds any goals you may have set for him. That"s balanced by a reckless spirit that can be blind to consequences, so it can be necessary to protect him from his sometimes intemperate desire to guard his loved ones. Irish Terriers are wonderful watchdogs, barking to warn their owners of anything new. Some dogs will become excessive barkers if their behavior isn"t controlled from the start. Thanking the dog for the alert and then distracting him with another command or game is a good way to make sure your dog learns to control his barking. Irish Terriers are excellent people dogs when they receive early socialization, and this helps make them wonderful family companions. They"re best suited to families where someone is home during the day. They aren"t overly active indoors and are happy to relax with their people, but they need exercise in the form of walks and occasional romps in a securely fenced area. The Irish Terrier has excellent hunting skills and a strong desire to seek out and destroy vermin, so a fenced yard and leashed walks are necessary for his safety. He"ll chase rapidly moving objects without paying attention to where the chase is leading him. Irish Terriers adore children and are great playmates, especially when raised with them. Make sure very young children are supervised at all times to prevent injury to both the dog and the child. Irish Terriers can learn to get along with cats if they"re raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not be trustworthy around smaller pets, especially pets from the rodent family such as mice, rats, hamsters, and gerbils. Their terrier instinct to hunt this type of animal may be too strong to overcome. This breed does not do well with other dogs. Irish Terriers can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex, and they don"t back down from a challenge. They will fight to the point of serious injury to themselves or the other dog. Being fearless, they"ll take on dogs much larger than themselves without thought for the consequences. Make sure your dog is on leash and you have control when around other dogs at any time. With his speed, endurance, and grace the Irish Terrier is an excellent competitor who loves the challenge of the agility ring. He can do well in the sports of obedience and rally, and his soft mouth and love of water make him a capable hunting dog who can retrieve game birds on land or from water. Irish Terriers are also excellent show dogs. If you"re looking for a versatile, active, spunky dog who will watch over your family for many years, the Irish Terrier could be the breed for you. He"s not one of the more well-known breeds, so finding a breeder with puppies can be difficult. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list and to pay a higher price than you might for a more popular breed. The expense is well worth it, though, admirers say. If you find the right dog, the Irish Terrier can be the most wonderful companion your family will ever have.
Irish Terriers will not necessarily get along with any other dog. They will fight if challenged by another dog and will not back down. Irish Terriers can be stubborn. They are terriers and will dig if your yard has moles or other rodents. Irish Terries can be barkers. Irish Terriers must have regular opportunities to burn off their energy. Irish Terriers need mental challenges such as training and play to thrive. Obedience training is highly recommended. The "come" command can be difficult to teach. They can be dominant and attempt to take over the household. You must be consistent and teach them that you are in charge at all times. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Irish Terrier is probably one of the oldest Terrier breeds and may have as one of its ancestors the now-extinct black and tan Terrier and a larger wheaten-colored terrier. He emerged as a recognized breed in 1875 or thereabouts, at a dog show in Glasgow, Scotland, of all places. By 1879, two Irish Terriers, Ch. Erin and Killney Boy, were producing many champions and are considered the foundation of the breed. The 1880s were a banner decade for the Irish Terrier. During that time, they were the fourth most popular breed in Britain. They were also the source of a controversy that led to a major change in the appearance of British dogs. It had been common practice to crop the ears of terriers and some other breeds, but in 1889 the Irish Terrier Club required that all dogs born after a certain date that year have uncropped ears if they were to be shown under Kennel Club rules. This led to a great outcry but eventually resulted in the banning of ear cropping for any breed in Great Britain. The breed rapidly spread to the United States. The first Irish Terrier was shown at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1881, and the first Irish Terrier registered with the American Kennel Club was Aileen in 1885. The Irish Terrier Club of America was founded in 1896. In World War I, Irish Terriers distinguished themselves as messenger dogs and sentinels, receiving many accolades for bravery and loyalty. The commandant of the British War Dog School, Lt. Col. E. H. Richardson, wrote of them: "Many a soldier is alive today through the effort of one of these Terriers.... They are extraordinarily intelligent, faithful, and honest, and a man who has one of them as a companion will never lack a true friend." Given his fine qualities, it"s surprising that the Irish Terrier has slowly faded from popularity. He"s rarely seen in the show ring with the exception of specialty shows, which are well attended, but his popularity may receive a boost from the 2007 movie Firehouse Dog. Irish Terriers rank 123rd among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The ideal weight for males is 27 pounds, for females 25 pounds. The height at the shoulder is 18 to 20 inches.
The Irish Terrier was created to be a companion, guard dog, and hunter. As such, he"s good-tempered, spirited, alert, and adaptable. He"s also plucky, reckless, curious, and devoted. Those things all sound wonderful, and they are, but those characteristics aren"t always easy to live with. This is an independent, smart, strong-willed dog who"s scrappy with other dogs. He needs mental challenges in the form of training and play, physical exercise, and loving but firm discipline. On the plus side, Irish Terriers love people and are often friendly toward strangers. They"re not a one-person dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, an Irish Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
The Irish Terrier is a healthy breed and doesn"t have any common health problems. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Some Irish Terriers are inveterate escape artists, so fence height should be higher than one might think is needed for a dog this size. A good height is five to six feet. Like all terriers, ITs are diggers, so the bottom of your fence should be escape-proof as well. You may need to set it in concrete or line the bottom of it with chicken wire. An underground electronic fence will not keep an Irish Terrier confined. More important, it won"t prevent other dogs from coming onto your property and getting into a fight with your IT. The energetic Irish Terrier needs moderate exercise. Give him two or three walks on leash of 20 to 30 minutes each day. A chance to romp in a safely fenced area is also welcome. He"s not a true running breed, but he"s a good companion for joggers who go at an easy to moderate pace. He"s not a distance runner or a fast-paced dog. Condition him gradually, and wait until he"s fully grown before you start jogging with him. If you can control his tendency to bark, an Irish Terrier will do as well in an apartment as in a house. He should live indoors with his people, and given sufficient exercise, he"s a quiet, polite housemate. If you leave him alone in the backyard with no companionship or occupation, he"s likely to relandscape it with a number of holes. Puppy or adult, the Irish Terrier is playful, but his idea of play and yours may vary. He"ll enjoy shredding magazines or other papers, overturning the garbage or the laundry basket, surfing the kitchen counter or dining room table for something to eat (he"ll find a way up there) and, of course, barking at every passing car, dog, bicyclist — you get the idea. Dogproof your home, teach him what"s acceptable behavior and what"s not, and crate him when you can"t be there to supervise, especially during his curious puppyhood. A crate protects him from getting into trouble for being destructive, and it protects your belongings from destruction. When it comes to training, the Irish Terrier has a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. You"ve got to give him an incentive to do what you want, and if you don"t keep training fun and interesting, he"ll just ignore you. Training an Irish Terrier requires creativity, firmness, and positive reinforcement in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. He"s sensitive and won"t respond well to harsh treatment. Keep training sessions short, change them around a lot, and always end them when he"s done something well and you can praise him for it.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your adult Irish Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Irish Terrier is jacketed with dense, wiry hair. The hairs grow so closely together that even if you part them with your fingers, it"s hard to see the skin. It"s short enough that you can still see the outline of the body. At the base of the stiff outer coat is some finer and softer hair, lighter in color, which is the undercoat. The double coat protects the Irish Terrier from rough underbrush and cold or wet weather when he"s working or playing outdoors. His coat is bright red, golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). He may have a small patch of white on the chest. Puppies sometimes have black hair at birth, which should disappear before they are grown. Brush the coat weekly with a natural bristle brush to keep it clean and healthy. You must strip it by hand a couple of times a year if you want to keep the hard texture and bright color, a must if you plan to show your Irish Terrier. For companion dogs, it"s often easier to clip the coat, but be aware that it will become softer to the touch and lighter in color. You may or may not care about that. If you plan to strip it, ask the breeder to show you how. It"s the kind of thing you can do while you and your IT are watching a 30-minute television show. If you don"t mind the scruffy look, you can just leave the coat as is, with no stripping or clipping. Irish Terriers shed little and are sometimes referred to as nonallergenic or hypoallergenic. There is no truly nonallergenic breed. Every dog produces some allergens through skin dander (not hair), saliva, and urine. That said, some people with allergies do find that they can tolerate this breed. Individual dogs, even within the same breed, vary in the amount of allergens they produce, so the best thing you can do is to meet as many Irish Terriers as possible and see how you react around them. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Irish Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don"t get caught in the carpet and tear, and don"t scratch your legs when your Irish Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. It"s not exactly a grooming issue, but your Irish Terrier puppy"s ears may need to be "trained" to achieve those perfectly folded V-shaped ears that contribute to the Irish Terrier"s roguish demeanor. This involves gluing and taping the ears to the head until they fall right, usually at 4 to 8 months of age. If it"s necessary, your dog"s breeder can show you how.
It"s said that the little people (leprechauns) gave Irish Terriers to children to be their playmates. Their size and energy level make them great companions for active kids, but as always, they should both be supervised, especially if children are very young. Teach your puppy not to be rough or mouthy, and teach your child not to pull the dog"s tail or ears or hit him. Children should never approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Terriers don"t like strange dogs, and they can be aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Early socialization with lots of other dogs, strong leadership on your part, and neutering can go a long way toward reducing an Irish Terrier"s dog aggression, but they"re not a guarantee that you"ll turn him into a dog who"s buddy-buddy with other canines. If you have one Irish Terrier, he can probably learn to get along with one or more cats. Early socialization is key. More than one Irish Terrier may gang up on a cat or cats. Always supervise their interactions and, if necessary, separate them when you"re gone.

The Irish Water Spaniel is often mistaken for a large brown poodle because of his distinctive top knot and the curly hair that covers his body. While back in the deeps of time a Poodle ancestor may be lurking in his family tree, the Irish Water Spaniel is most definitely not a Poodle. Rather, he might be described as what the standard Poodle once was: a versatile hunting, pointing, and retrieving dog. Not surprisingly, given his name, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for his strong swimming skills and excels at retrieving waterfowl as well as upland game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. Not content with his striking looks and hunting talents, he"s an entertainer as well. The IWS is known for his clownish behavior. He often makes a game out of a simple task and always seems to be having a wonderful time. Irish Water Spaniels are highly intelligent, active, willing and energetic. The centuries of breeding that have contributed to their retrieving skills have also instilled in them a desire to please. This makes an Irish Water Spaniel relatively easy to train. That said, he has a mischievous streak that can cause him to be a challenge at times to deal with. The breed can do well in obedience work, but that mischievous, fun-loving personality may surface unexpectedly during competition and wreak havoc with your goals for that day. The Irish Water Spaniel is a relatively quiet dog for the most part. He seems to reserve his barking for times when it"s necessary to warn his family. His alert and inquisitive temperament makes him an excellent watchdog. While he"s usually devoted to the entire family, he may choose a particular person as his favorite. The Irish Water Spaniel"s dense coat does require some commitment to grooming on a regular basis. It must be brushed two to three times a week to prevent mats from forming. The natural oils in his water-repellent coat attract dirt and debris and hold it in the coat. Brushing helps to distribute the oil through the coat and removes any debris. An interesting characteristic is their webbed feet, which come in handy when they"re swimming. Irish Water Spaniels love to swim and will plunge into any nearby body of water if given half a chance. And they may not be ready to leave the water when you"re ready for them to. If you can provide this breed with opportunities to swim, do so! It"s great exercise for this high-energy dog. The Irish Water Spaniel can be the perfect companion for an active family with the time to socialize, train, and exercise him. He"ll be a devoted, loving member of the family and will entertain all with his clownish and mischievous attitude toward life. Your Irish Water Spaniel can be a hunting companion, conformation, obedience, agility, or rally competitor or just a friend and loving companion for everyone in the family.
Can have life-threatening reaction to sulfa drugs, Ivermectin and vaccines especially the leptospirosis component. This is a breed that is probably not suitable for the first time dog owner because he can be headstrong, and an independent thinker. Irish Water Spaniels have lots of energy and need daily exercise. Not every Irish Water Spaniel can be trusted to get along with smaller pets. Socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences — at an early age is needed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The exact origin of this breed as many others is debated among fanciers and shrouded in the mists of Ireland. The Irish Water Spaniel appeared in Ireland in the 1830s, mainly from the kennel of Justin McCarthy. His dog "Boatswain," whelped in 1834, is credited with being the sire of the modern breed. Mr. McCarthy would never reveal the sources of his breeding and took the secret with him when he died. Speculation focuses on the early Barbet or Poodle-type dogs from France that could have come to Ireland and possibly Portuguese Water Dogs that arrived on Portuguese fishing boats. There were also two types of water spaniels in Ireland at the time, one of which sported a curly coat and could have contributed to the breed"s makeup. The first show classes for the breed were at a show in Birmingham in 1862, and in 1899 the first Irish Water Spaniel ran in a field trial. There were four Irish Water Spaniels entered in the first Westminster Kennel Club show in 1877. The Irish Water Spaniel remains an active, popular working and show dog in his native country. The breed came to the United States in the 1870s but has never had the popularity that he enjoys in Ireland. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel ranks 139th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club, a well-kept secret indeed.
The IWS is the tallest member of the spaniel family. Males are 22 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 65 pounds; females are 21 to 23 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
True to his spaniel nature, the IWS is alert and inquisitive. Unlike many spaniels, however, he may be reserved toward strangers, although he should never be shy or aggressive. Irish Water Spaniels are highly trainable, but they"re independent thinkers and will do their best to get their own way whenever possible. This is especially true with young males testing their status. For this reason, they are probably not the best choice for a first-time dog owner who may not understand how to provide the guidance and sensible discipline this dog needs. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Irish Water Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your IWS puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Water Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Water Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Water Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Follicular Dysplasia: A group of syndromes that have hair loss and changes in coat quality in common. Hair loss in Irish Water Spaniels may first be noticed at 2 to 4 years of age over the back, and spreads slowly to most of the trunk. The coat change is progressive and permanent but has little effect on the dog"s health. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland, which is found in the neck. The mild symptoms of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs of this disease are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy and irregular heat cycles. The fur on the dog becomes course and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires a lifetime treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your IWS has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if necessary when the dog reaches maturity. Paronychia: This condition is not well understood. It occurs in the dog"s toenails, and you will often see dogs with it chewing on their feet. The problem can occur in dogs who have had their nails trimmed regularly. The toenail"s inner core becomes mushy and may become infected with bacteria and fungus, causing a foul odor. Even without an infection present the disease will progress. The outer shell of the nail eventually falls off, exposing the quick. One or more toes may be affected. Treatment is necessary to avoid suffering. Some owners eliminate allergens in the diet and reported satisfactory results; other owners had the toes amputated. Distichiasis: This minor condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your dog squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Megaesophagus: Megaesophagus is believed to be both a congenital disease and adult-onset disease in which the esophagus loses tone and dilates. This hinders the ability of the esophagus to transport food and can prevent breathing during swallowing. Dogs with megaesophagus often regurgitate food that has not reached the stomach. This is not a powerful active vomiting but more of a passive regurgitation where the food falls out of the dog"s mouth. It"s caused by nerve damage to the esophagus and in the case of young puppies the damage may improve as the dog grows. In adults, megaesophagus is usually preceded by another disease that causes nerve damage. The disease can be treated with medication and diet, but it"s difficult to manage and doesn"t always have good results. Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your IWS has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Irish Water Spaniels suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, signs include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your IWS carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual. Drug Sensitivity: Some breeds, including Irish Water Spaniels, show sensitivity to certain medications, including some antiparasitic and antibiotic drugs. Signs of this sensitivity range from tremors, depression, seizures, incoordination, hypersalivation, coma, and even death. Ask your veterinarian to become familiar with the drugs that can negatively affect the Irish Water Spaniel.
A hunting breed with a great deal of energy and stamina, the Irish Water Spaniel needs a yard to romp in and isn"t suited to apartment life. Give him at least an hour a day of running, long walks or hikes, or vigorous play such as retrieving a ball in the yard. If you have a pool or access to a lake, swimming is a great way for him to get exercise. Keep an eye on him just as you would a child, and be sure he knows how to get out of the pool safely. You can break up his activity into two or three 20- or 30-minute sessions throughout the day. As with any dog, don"t run him ragged in the heat of the day. Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your IWS pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Irish Water Spaniels work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kind but firm consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The IWS who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. An Irish Water Spaniel will make his own entertainment if you don"t.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. If you"re unsure whether your Irish Water Spaniel is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Irish Water Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Irish Water Spaniel has a double coat — a top coat and an under coat — with tight, crisp ringlets that cover the back, back, sides, and rear. Beneath the ribs the hair is longer, and curls and waves of hair cover the legs. Hair on the throat is short and smooth, forming a v-shaped patch. The curly body forms a sharp contrast with the smooth coat on the face, throat, toes, and tail. Speaking of the tail, it"s a striking characteristic of the breed. Wide at the root, where the tail meets the body, it tapers to a fine point. It"s covered with short, smooth hair and is known as a rat tail. The Irish Water Spaniel is always a solid liver color, described as deep reddish brown. You won"t see any white markings on him except for those due to graying from age. Irish Water Spaniels shed little to no hair, but they must be brushed two or three times a week to keep the coat from tangling or matting, as well as to keep it clean and healthy. The oil in the coat attracts debris and dirt. Regular brushing not only distributes the oil throughout the coat to keep the skin healthy but also removes the dirt and debris. The breed can be prone to ear infections due to the pendant earflap. In other words, those floppy ears hold in moisture, and the wet, warm environment is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and dry the ears every time your IWS goes swimming. To do this, gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your IWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Irish Water Spaniel"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your IWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your IWS to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Water Spaniels do best with children if they are raised with them. Early socialization — exposure to a variety of peoples, places, sights, sounds, and situations — also helps. Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Water Spaniels can get along well with other pets in the family if introduced to them at a young age. Otherwise, supervise them carefully. They are hunting dogs and may view smaller animals, especially birds, as prey. Protect pet birds even if you"re sure your IWS understands they"re off limits. Some spaniels can learn that, if they"re taught from puppyhood, but don"t assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your IWS doesn"t pull your parakeet"s tail or your parrot won"t take a bite out of your Irish Water Spaniel"s sensitive nose.

When Irish eyes are smiling, you can be sure they belong to an Irish Wolfhound. He has a noble and commanding appearance, but beneath his shaggy eyebrows twinkle eyes with a sweet, gentle expression. This ancient breed originated in Ireland, where he served as both a war dog and hunting dog. He came close to extinction in the 19th century after the great prey animals — wolves, deer, and wild boars — had largely disappeared in Ireland, but the breed was revived and today is a wonderful companion who draws the admiration of many. The Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all dog breeds and the largest of the sighthounds — dogs that chase moving prey. Despite his distant past as a ferocious war dog, he"s a gentle giant who gets along with everyone, including children, other dogs, and sometimes even cats. He loves long walks, which are important in maintaining his huge body, but otherwise he"s satisfied to be a couch potato. While they"re quiet indoors, Irish Wolfhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Consider whether you"d be able to get one up and down the stairs if he were injured or sick. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can have room to run. The Irish Wolfhound is not the ideal watchdog. He doesn"t bark an alarm, and although he has the size to deter many would-be intruders he doesn"t have the nature of a guard dog. He"s brave but not aggressive. Like any dog, the Irish Wolfhound isn"t the breed for everyone. His gigantic size alone is a consideration. He has several health issues that potential owners must be aware of. And he"s a short-lived breed who has only a 6- to 8-year life span. If you"re looking for a breed that lives many years and is easy to care for, then he"s not the breed for you. But if you"re looking for a companion who will fill your life with love, admiration, and sloppy kisses, then look no further.
Irish Wolfhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels inside, they need room to stretch out and aren"t built for negotiating stairs. Irish Wolfhounds require at least 40 minutes of daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard. Irish Wolfhounds need a fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey away from their yards. They should not be kept in a yard with underground electronic fencing. The desire to chase is too strong to be overcome by the threat of a momentary shock. The Irish Wolfhound is a gentle dog who usually gets along well with everyone. With early socialization and training, he"ll be gracious toward other dogs and forbearing of indoor cats. He"ll view outdoor cats and other animals as fair game. If you are looking for a long-lived breed, the Irish Wolfhound is not for you. He lives roughly 6 to 8 years and his giant size predisposes him to many health problems. Irish Wolfhounds do not make good guard dogs although their size can be a deterrent to a would-be intruder. The Irish Wolfhound is an average shedder and only needs to be brushed on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. You"ll need to strip the longer portions of his coat if you want to keep him looking like the Irish Wolfhounds that compete in the conformation ring. Irish Wolfhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing animals or other moving objects, such as radio-controlled cars. The Irish Wolfhound is not a pony and should not be ridden by children, no matter how small. His joints aren"t built for the strain. Nor is he built for pulling a cart or other vehicle. Irish Wolfhounds thrive when they are with their owners. They are not outdoor dogs, although they enjoy playing outside. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Throughout history, the Great Hound of Ireland has been a marvel wherever he went. Roman consul Aurelius wrote in 391 AD that "all Rome viewed with wonder" the seven Irish Wolfhounds that had been sent to him as a gift. And no wonder! The dog"s great size made him fearsome in battle and capable of pursuing the Irish elk, which stood six feet at the shoulder — double the Wolfhound"s height — as well as the wolf, the predator from which the Wolfhound eventually took his name. Before that, he was known simply as Cu, a Gaelic word that probably meant hound, wolf dog, or war dog. There are many mentions of the great dog in Irish literature over the centuries. He was used as a war dog, his job being to pull men down from horses or chariots. They were also used for hunting elk, boar, and wolves as well as guarding homes and livestock. The Irish Wolfhound was prized for his ferocity and bravery in battle. Irish law permitted only kings and nobles to own the Irish Wolfhound, and the number of dogs owned was related to the prestige of the title held. For example, members of the lesser nobility were limited to two Wolfhounds. Irish legends say that folk hero Finn MacCumhaill had 500 Irish Wolfhounds, with his two favorites being Bran and Sceolan, who were of magic birth. The Irish Wolfhound was a popular gift between rulers and other important people. Often they arrived wearing chains and collars made with silver and gold. A favorite tale is that of the Irish Wolfhound sent to the Prince of Wales, Llewellyn, by England"s King John in 1210. The hound was named Gelert, and Llewellyn loved him more than life itself. One day, Llewellyn went hunting and charged Gelert with guarding his baby son while he was gone. When he returned, he found the baby"s crib overturned and Gelert covered in blood. Mad with grief, he slew Gelert, but as the faithful dog lay dying, Llewellyn heard the cry of his son. He searched further and found the child, alive, next to the body of a wolf that Gelert had killed. Llewellyn mourned his dog forever after and erected a tomb in Gelert"s honor, which can still be seen in Caernarvon, Wales. Despite his fame, the Irish Wolfhound"s numbers declined over the years, especially after the elk and the wolf in Ireland were hunted to extinction. Irish Wolfhounds were kept by only a few families as ornamental dogs and rarely saw use in the field. The breed might have disappeared had it not caught the interest of Major H. D. Richardson. In the mid-1800s, Richardson wrote a book suggesting that the Irish Wolfhound and the Highland Deerhound were the same breed. He began breeding Irish Wolfhounds, basing his breeding program on the Glengarry Deerhounds. Another advocate of the Irish Wolfhound was a Captain George Augustus Graham, who used Glengarry Deerhounds, Borzoi, and a Tibetan Mastiff to revitalize the Irish Wolfhound breed. He also used Irish Wolfhounds that were crossed with Great Danes, including a Harlequin Great Dane. Graham founded the Irish Wolfhound Club in 1885 and England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1925. The first Irish Wolfhound registered with the American Kennel Club was Ailbe in 1897, and the Irish Wolfhound Club of America was founded in 1927. Today, the Irish Wolfhound ranks 77th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
A male Irish Wolfhound stands at least 32 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs at least 120 pounds. The Irish Wolfhound female is at least 30 inches tall and 105 pounds. Many are larger. Males usually average 34 to 35 inches and 140 to 180 pounds; females 32 to 34 inches and 115 to 140 pounds.
Intelligent and gentle, the Irish Wolfhound has a strong desire for human companionship. With his family, he"s calm, dignified, and responsive. He"s sensitive and must be trained using positive reinforcement such as praise and food rewards. Harsh words or physical punishment will cause him to shut down. When it comes to watchdog duties, he"s alert but not suspicious. There"s not an aggressive bone in his body, so he"s a poor choice as a guard dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Irish Wolfhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Wolfhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Wolfhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Wolfhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Wolfhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Irish Wolfhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is probably related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of the Irish Wolfhound is generally too much for the low-body-fat Irish Wolfhound. Choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or weight management or anti-inflammatory medication to control the pain. Liver Shunt: A liver shunt is an abnormal blood flow between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet. Heart Disease: Irish Wolfhounds can be prone to heart disease, primarily heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Fibrocartilaginous Embolic Myelopathy: This condition occurs when pieces of cartilaginous material obstruct blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, causing partial or complete paralysis of the hind legs. The condition usually affects dogs between the ages of 3 and 6 years and may occur suddenly during any activity. There is no treatment, but some dogs improve with time. The severity of the loss of use must be determined before a course of action can be decided. Some dogs can live out their lives with only minimal assistance, but others are fully paralyzed. If physical rehabilitation doesn"t help, euthanasia is the kindest option. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
Despite his great size, the Irish Wolfhound is a housedog. He loves being with people and is calm indoors. He"s best suited to a home without stairs; going down them can damage his joints. Give him access to a securely fenced yard where he can run, and he"ll be happy. A fence is necessary to prevent this breed from chasing other animals. An underground electronic fence won"t do the job; the instinct to chase is much stronger than the fear of a momentary shock. Irish Wolfhound adults need a couple of 20-minute play times where they can run freely every day. They"ll enjoy a walk as well. Avoid any exercise an hour before meals and two hours after meals to decrease the risk of gastric torsion, or bloat. Puppies need free play in a securely fenced yard, but limit running to only a few minutes a day. They shouldn"t be taken on walks until they"re at least six months old. Start with short walks of no more than five minutes, and build up to walks of a mile over a three-month period. They shouldn"t reach a distance of two miles until they"re a year old. Continue this gradual and gentle exercise program until the Irish Wolfhound reaches maturity at 18 to 24 months of age. Giant breeds are prone to joint problems, and excessive exercise during their growth and development phase can damage their joints. Walks on leash are a must with this breed. They are sighthounds and will chase running animals when they see them, heedless of your calls to come. A sighthound on the chase will focus on his prey, not traffic, and can easily become injured or killed. He can also injure or kill the animal he"s pursuing, which won"t do much for your relationship with your neighbors if their Toy Poodle or Siamese cat is his victim. Irish Wolfhounds are intelligent and trainable if you"re consistent and use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise. They"re generally easy to housetrain, and a crate can help, although it shouldn"t be overused. Crate training is a great aid to housetraining, and it will also keep your belongings safe from your puppy and your puppy safe from your wrath because he chewed up your favorite shoes. The Irish Wolfhound should not be crated for long periods, however. Long hours in a crate can damage his joints.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Irish Wolfhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Wolfhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Wolfhound coat is rough and hard. The hair on the eyes and under the jaw is wiry and long. A pet-quality Irish Wolfhound may have a softer or longer coat, but that doesn"t affect his ability to be a companion. Coat colors are gray, brindle, red, black, white, or fawn. Irish Wolfhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush your dog weekly to keep the coat healthy. He shouldn"t need a bath more than once or twice a year unless he gets into something stinky. To give the coat a neat look for the show ring or simply because you prefer it, gently pluck excess hair from the ears with your thumb and forefinger and use thinning scissors or a stripping knife to neaten the hair on the feet and tidy the hair on the side of the neck. Don"t remove too much; the Irish Wolfhound should have something of a mane. To finish, strip out long hair under the belly and at the base of the tail. You want your Irish Wolfhound to have a smooth, clean look that shows off his graceful lines. Brush your dog"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Irish Wolfhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Wolfhounds are gentle with children, but simply because of their large size they can accidentally knock toddlers down and scare or injure them. They"re best suited to homes with older children. Irish Wolfhounds are not ponies, and children cannot ride them. Your Wolfhound can be injured if children try to ride him. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. With early socialization and training, your Irish Wolfhound should get along well with other dogs. He may chase small animals such as cats unless brought up with them and taught not to. It"s vital to properly introduce him to other animals in the household and supervise their interactions. He"ll consider outdoor cats and other small animals fair game.
Irish Wolfhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Irish Wolfhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Irish Wolfhound rescue.

If you"re an art lover, you may have seen the Italian Greyhound in centuries-old portraits, immortalized with their noble owners by famous artists. This slender, elegant dog is the smallest of the sighthounds — the group of dogs bred to hunt by sight and give chase — and closely resembles his much larger Greyhound cousin. Agile and athletic, he has a small, muscular body and an elegant high-stepping gait. The IG, as he"s often called, retains his instinct for hunting small game and will chase anything that moves. He can reach top speeds of 25 miles per hour, so if he gets loose he won"t be easy to catch. Although he"s small, he has lots of energy and appreciates plenty of opportunities to exercise. A fit IG can even make a good jogging partner. The Italian Greyhound has a gentle personality, loving and affectionate with family members, but often reserved or shy with strangers. Despite his mild nature, he has a surprisingly deep, big-dog bark, making him a good watchdog — although he"s too small to back up his barks and provide any actual protection. This is an intelligent breed who can be easy to train, but you"ll need to make it fun for him to overcome his "what"s in it for me?" attitude. When well trained, he can shine in dog sports such as obedience training, agility, and rally. The athletic, graceful IG seems built for agility, and many love the sport and do it well. What they don"t do well is housetraining. Like many small breeds, the IG can be difficult to housetrain, and some dogs are never completely trustworthy in the house. Aside from the occasional cleanup, life with an IG is both restful and zestful. He loves snuggling with his people for a while, then flying around the house and jumping on furniture and tabletops. IGs are catlike in their love of high places, and you"ll often find them perched on the backs of chairs, on windowsills, or any other high spot they can reach. Older IGs are more sedate and will cuddle with you on your recliner and just enjoy the day. On sunny days, expect to find your IG sunbathing in the yard, one of his favorite pastimes. He loves warmth and is fussy about getting cold or wet. It"s not unusual for IG owners to have a sheltered area in the yard so their dogs can go potty on rainy days without getting their feet wet. At night, he"ll burrow beneath the covers on your bed. Your IG will demand attention if he feels he"s being ignored. Privacy becomes a distant memory once you own an Italian Greyhound, because he"ll follow you everywhere at all times. He"s also curious and will investigate anything that catches his interest. The Italian Greyhound is one of those small dogs with a big personality. He"s affectionate, possessive, and loving, charming his way into your life. If you can give him the attention, exercise, and training he needs — not to mention tons of love — then the Italian Greyhound can make an elegant and loveable addition to your household.
Italian Greyhounds were bred to hunt and still have the hunting instinct. They"ll chase anything that moves, including cars, so when you"re outside keep them on leash or in a fenced area. This breed is sensitive to drugs such as anesthetics of the barbiturate class and organophosphate insecticides. Make sure your veterinarian is aware of these sensitivities, and avoid using organophosphate products to treat your home and yard for fleas. Italian Greyhound puppies are fearless and believe they can fly. Broken bones are common in pups between four and 12 months old, particularly the radius and ulna (the bones in the front legs). Although they"re clever, Italian Greyhounds have a short attention span and a "what"s in it for me?" attitude toward training. Keep training sessions short and positive, using play, treats, and praise to motivate your Italian Greyhound to learn. This breed can be extremely difficult to housetrain. Even if you follow a housetraining program religiously, your Italian Greyhound may never be totally trustworthy in the house. It helps to have a dog door, so your dog can come and go as he wishes. And if your dog gives you the signs that he needs to go outside, take him out that instant — they"re not good at holding it. Italian Greyhounds need lots of love and attention, and if they don"t get it, they"ll become shy or hyper. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Italian Greyhound is an old breed, and dogs like it may have been around for more than two millennia. Miniature greyhounds are seen in 2,000-year-old artifacts from what"s now modern-day Turkey and Greece, and archaeological digs have turned up small Greyhound skeletons. Although the breed"s original purpose has been lost to history, the Italian Greyhound may have served as a hunter of small game in addition to his duties as a companion. By the Middle Ages, the breed had made its way to southern Europe and was very popular among the aristocracy, especially in Italy — hence its name. Many Italian Greyhounds were immortalized, along with their owners, in portraits by famous artists such as Pisanello and Giotto di Bondone. In the 1600s the Italian Greyhound arrived in England, where, as in Italy, it found many fans among the nobility. Royal owners throughout the centuries include Mary, Queen of Scots, Princess Anne of Denmark, Charles I, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Queen Victoria, during whose reign the breed"s popularity peaked. The American Kennel Club registered its first Italian Greyhound in 1886, and American breeders began to establish the breed in the United States. Although the American population of Italian Greyhounds was small, they may have helped save the breed from extinction. During World Wars I and II, when dog breeding became an unaffordable luxury for most people, the numbers of Italian Greyhounds in England dwindled dangerously low. Each time the wars ended, British breeders used those American-bred Italian Greyhounds to restore the breed in Europe. Today the Italian Greyhound is enjoying a second renaissance, as modern dog owners rediscover the elegant little hound who"s delighted his human companions for at least 2,000 years.
Italian Greyhounds stand 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 6 to 10 pounds, with some as large as 14 or 15 pounds.
The Italian Greyhound is sensitive, alert, smart, and playful. He"s affectionate with his family, and loves to snuggle with you and stick close to your side all day. Strangers may see a more shy, reserved side of his personality. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the IG needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your IG puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. When treated harshly, the Italian Greyhound can become fearful or snappy. Like other hounds, he can have a "what"s in it for me?" attitude toward training, so you"ll do best with motivational methods that use play, treats, and praise to encourage the dog to get it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong.
IGs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all IGs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In IGs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Vitreous Degeneration: The vitreous is a clear jelly that is the single largest structure of the eye. A healthy vitreous is essential for normal vision. If the vitreous becomes cloudy, liquefies, or moves from its position, vision may become impaired or lost. The condition is believed to be inherited, but the exact method of inheritance is unknown. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, this condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Epilepsy: The Italian Greyhound can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with proper management of this hereditary disorder. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner. Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.
Italian Greyhounds (also known as IGs) have short coats and get the shivers easily, so they"re not an outdoor breed. They need to be inside the house with their family, especially in bad weather. To keep your IG comfortable on chilly outdoor walks, give him a sweater or jacket. During warm weather, protect his thin skin with sunscreen made for dogs. Many Italian Greyhounds develop skin cancer, possibly because they love lying in the sun, so don"t let your dog bake for hours. These little dogs have lots of energy, especially as puppies and young adults, but in their golden years they"ll often adapt to the activity level of their owners. A daily walk will help your Italian Greyhound get his ya-yas out, but make sure to keep him on a leash. Even though he"s small, he has the same instinct to chase as a larger sighthound and will take off after a squirrel, rabbit, or anything else that runs by. A leash is your only hope of hanging onto him. His hunting drive also means you"ll need a secure fence in your yard. Italian Greyhounds are fabulous jumpers, so don"t assume that a little four-foot wall is enough to keep him in. And don"t use an underground electronic fence; the momentary shock won"t deter your Italian Greyhound if he sees something he wants to chase. IGs are intelligent and easy to train if you have the right attitude. Like other hounds they usually approach training with a "What"s in it for me?" philosophy. Motivational training methods — those that use food, praise, and play to reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong — is the best way to persuade them that they want to do what you ask. And since they have the short attention spans common to sighthounds, it"s best to keep training sessions short and sweet. Like many small dogs, there"s one aspect of training they don"t pick up as easily: housetraining. Even with patience and consistency, you may never be completely successful. The number one reason people give up their Italian Greyhound to rescue groups or animal shelters is because they couldn"t housetrain them. Harsh punishment will backfire, often making the dog fearful or even snappy. Your best bet is to get a dog door, so he can go in and out at will. Italian Greyhounds can also learn to use a litter box, although this doesn"t always work well if you have more than one IG as you might end up cleaning it quite often. Prevent accidents by taking your IG outside the moment he gives you any signs that he needs to go — no waiting "just a minute." You can teach an Italian Greyhound that outdoors is the place to go potty, but if means going out in rain or snow, or if he doesn"t have immediate access to the yard, he"d just as soon go indoors.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality, high-calorie dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your IG in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your IG, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
An Italian Greyhound"s short coat looks glossy like satin and feels soft to the touch. You"ll find it in all shades of fawn, cream, red, blue, or black, either solid or with white markings. One of the benefits of living with an Italian Greyhound is that his coat doesn"t shed much and is easy to care for. All you really need to do is brush it when it gets dusty, and bathe the dog when he"s rolled in anything smelly — a favorite activity. Brush your IG"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your IG to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Italian Greyhounds can do well with children, but because they"re small and delicate, it"s especially important to teach kids that the dog is living animal, not a toy, who must be treated with love and respect. Many breeders will not sell a puppy to a household with children younger than ten years old. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Italian Greyhounds usually get along well with other pets, although you may need to keep an eye on them when they"re cavorting about with bigger dogs, who could accidentally hurt them while playing.
Italian Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many IGs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an IG rescue.

Once upon a time, hunting was a favorite pastime among men of property, including men of the church. We can thank one of those hard-hunting English parsons for the Jack Russell Terrier, developed to hunt fox in the south of England some 200 years ago. Parson John Russell, "Jack" to his friends, wanted an efficient hunting dog and decided to design exactly the dog he had in mind. The result was a bold, athletic dog who won hearts with his quickness, intelligence, determination, and intense desire to hunt. The Jack Russell Terrier, also called the Parson Russell Terrier, is a favorite among horse owners, dog sports enthusiasts, animal trainers for film and television, and people who simply appreciate his fearless personality, boundless energy, entertaining antics, and portable size. But beware! The trained Jack Russell that you see on TV or in movies doesn"t come that way. Teaching a Jack Russell to become a civilized companion is no easy task. It requires lots of time and patience as well as a strong sense of humor. The JRT is highly trainable, but he has a mind of his own and won"t stand for boredom. If you don"t keep him entertained, he"ll find his own amusements, and you probably won"t be happy with the results. If you want a dog who can learn tricks, run an agility or flyball course in seconds flat, play fetch until you drop, and who will make a charming companion when he"s not getting into mischief, the Jack Russell may be the dog for you. If you can"t deal with a dog who will chew, dig, and bark, rocket through the house multiple times daily, chase cats and other small animals with glee and murderous intent, and will always find the loophole in any command you give, he"s definitely not the dog for you, no matter how cute and small he is. If you have the time and patience to devote to him, the Jack Russell has many qualities that make him an ideal family dog. He"s devoted to his people and loves being with them. His heritage as a hunting dog makes him an excellent jogging companion once he"s full grown. Active older children will find him to be a happy and affectionate playmate, but his rambunctious nature can overwhelm younger kids. On the downside, his fearless nature frequently puts him in harm"s way. He has tons of energy and won"t be satisfied by a sedate walk around the block. This is a dog who loves to run and jump and fetch. Plan on giving him 30 to 45 minutes daily of vigorous exercise. He"s an escape artist who"s best suited to a home with a yard and a secure fence that can"t be climbed, dug under, or jumped over. An underground electronic fence won"t contain a JRT. The Jack"s strong prey drive makes him entirely untrustworthy off leash, so you"ll need snap on the leash when you"re outside of fenced areas. And his instinct to "go to ground" — to dig for prey — means your garden isn"t safe from excavation. A Jack Russell can fill your days with laughter and love, but only if you can provide him with the attention, training, supervision, and structure he needs. First-time or timid dog owners would do well to start with a less challenging pooch. Do yourself and the dog a favor by considering carefully whether this is the right breed for you. If it is, you"re in for a wild but wonderful ride.
The Jack Russell Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging and can make quite a large hole in a short time. It" easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area than it is to break him of a digging habit. Jack Russell Terriers must have a securely fenced yard to give them room to play and burn off their abundant energy. Underground electronic fencing won"t hold them. Jacks have been known to climb trees and even chain link fencing to escape their yards, so it"s best if their time outdoors is supervised. First-time or timid dog owners would do well to choose another kind of dog. The Jack can be a challenge even for an experienced dog owner. He"s strong willed and requires firm and consistent training. Jacks can be recreational barkers, so they"re not suited to apartment life. Aggression toward other dogs can be a serious problem with the Jack Russell Terrier if he"s not taught to get along with other canines from an early age. The Jack Russell thrives when he"s with his family and should not live outdoors or in a kennel. When you leave the house, try turning on a radio to help prevent separation anxiety. Jacks are bouncy and will jump up on people and things. They"re capable of jumping higher than 5 feet. Jack Russells have a strong prey drive and will take off after smaller animals. They should never be trusted off leash unless they"re in a fenced area. Jack Russell Terriers have a high energy level and are active indoors and out. They need several walks per day, or several good games in the yard. They make excellent jogging companions. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and breeds for sound temperaments.
The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in southern England during the mid-1800s by Parson John Russell, from whom the breed took its name. Russell aimed to create a working terrier who would hunt with hounds, bolting foxes from their dens so the hounds could chase them. The Jack Russell became a favorite of many sportsmen, especially those who hunted on horseback. The breed was known in the U.S. by the 1930s, and several breed clubs sprang up with different opinions concerning the Jack"s appearance, working ability, and whether he should compete in conformation shows or remain a working dog. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America maintains an independent registry and considers the Jack purely a hunting dog, but the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America (JRTCA) sought recognition by the American Kennel Club, which was granted in 2000. To differentiate it from the dogs registered by the JRTCA, the American Kennel Club renamed the breed, calling it the Parson Russell Terrier.
Jack Russells vary widely in size, because different types were used for different purposes and terrain. They range in height from 10 to 15 inches at the shoulder and weigh 13 to 17 pounds. Jack Russells who stand 10 to 12 inches and are longer than they are tall are known as Shorty Jacks. Shorty Jacks resemble Corgis or Dachshunds more than the taller, more balanced American Kennel Club-registered Parson Russell Terriers or the dogs registered by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America or the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America.
The energetic and spirited Jack packs a lot of personality into his small body. Loving, devoted, and endlessly amusing, he enjoys life and all it has to offer. Given half a chance, he"ll pursue his delights over fences and through the streets. He"s incredibly intelligent, but his wilful nature can make him difficult to train. Friendly toward people, he can be aggressive toward other dogs and any animal that resembles prey, including cats. His fearless nature puts him at risk when he decides to take on a bigger dog. He thrives on structure and routine, but training sessions should be short and sweet to hold his interest. Repetition bores him. A proper Jack is friendly and affectionate, never shy. Like every dog, Jack Russells need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Jack Russell puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Jack Russell Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Jacks will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Jack Russells, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America doesn"t register any dogs with hereditary defects; dogs must pass a specific veterinary exam before being registered. The following conditions may affect Jack Russell Terriers: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is generally a disease of small breeds. This condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Deafness is associated with white coat color and is sometimes seen in this breed. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Glaucoma is a painful disease in which pressure is abnormally high in the eye. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor. If the fluid doesn"t drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases. That high pressure causes damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, occurs when there is a problem in the area of the eye where fluid goes out. Secondary glaucoma is a result of some other problem in the eye, such as inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally only affects one eye first. Affected eyes will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won"t react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment. Treatment can be surgery or it can be treated with medicine, depending on the case. Lens Luxation causes the lens of the eye to become displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It"s sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.
The Jack Russell is a people lover who should live indoors with the family. It"s best if he has access to a fenced yard where he can burn off some of his abundant energy. The fence should be impossible for him to climb, dig under, or jump — think Fort Knox. And don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Jack in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey. Always walk your Jack on leash to prevent him from chasing other animals, challenging bigger dogs, or running in front of cars. Give him 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble. Faint heart never trained feisty Jack Russell. People who live with Jack Russells must be firm and consistent in what they expect. Jacks are strong-willed dogs, and although they respond to positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards, they"ll become stubborn in the face of harsh corrections. Provide your Jack Russell with rules and routines and apply the right amount of patience and motivation, however, and you"ll be well rewarded. There are no limits to what a Jack Russell can learn when he"s paired with the right person. Give your Jack plenty of positive interactions with other dogs beginning in puppyhood — early socialization is important to prevent aggression toward other dogs.  
Recommended daily amount: 1.25 to 1.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Jack Russell in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Jack Russell Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Parson Russell Terrier comes in two coat types: smooth and broken. Both types have a double coat with a coarse texture. The broken coat is slightly longer with just a hint of eyebrows and a beard. Some Jacks have what"s called a rough coat, which is longer than a broken coat. Whatever its type, the coat is never curly or wavy. Jacks can be white, white with black or tan markings, or tricolor (white, black, and tan). The white on the body helps the hunter see the dog in the field. Both coat types need only weekly brushing to remove dead and loose hair. If you brush your Jack faithfully, he should rarely need a bath. Broken or rough coats must be stripped once or twice a year. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Jack enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. The only other grooming care he needs is dental hygiene. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease, daily for best results. Start brushing and examining your Jack when he"s a puppy, to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Jack Russell Terriers are loving and affectionate dogs who can do well in homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. They"re not suitable for homes with young children. Besides being rambunctious, they can snap when roughly handled. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. Some Jacks are aggressive toward other dogs, especially dogs of the same sex. They have a strong prey drive and will chase (and kill, if given the chance) cats and other small animals.

Jumpin" jiminy! Is that a Japanese Chin on your fireplace mantel? It is! People who live with the Chin often marvel at the breed"s ability to leap tall furniture in a single bound. The toy-size Japanese Chin has a catlike nature that includes the desire to be in high places, the ability to climb, and the tendency to wash himself. He has also been seen batting at objects much like a cat would. Feline traits notwithstanding, the Japanese Chin has all of the qualities one looks for in a companion dog. He thrives when he"s with his people, and he loves everyone. Japanese Chin do well in apartments and will adapt to any living situation, but their tiny size and love of human companionship mean they"re not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel. Japanese Chin have the classic look of an Oriental breed with a large, broad head; large, wide-set eyes; and a flattish face. Small, V-shaped ears hang down, set just below the top of the head. They carry their plumed tail jauntily over their back. They have an abundant coat, but looks are deceiving. The Chin is a wash-and-go breed and needs little more than a weekly brushing to maintain his elegant appearance. With the occasional exception of the ear fringes, the coat rarely mats, and it doesn"t require any trimming. Intelligent and well mannered, the Japanese Chin learns quickly, but he has a mind of his own. If training becomes repetitive, he will choose to do something more entertaining. He can be difficult to housetrain, but if you"re persistent and consistent he"ll get the message. In general, the Japanese Chin is a happy dog who gets along with everyone. He"s friendly toward other dogs and cats and is a playful companion for older children. Because of his small size, however, he"s not suited to homes with young children, who might accidentally injure him. Chin are loving and devoted to their family, but they have a natural shyness around new people and new situations. It"s not unusual for them to be slightly aloof with strangers until they get to know them. The Japanese Chin requires little in the way of exercise and is a great companion to people who can"t get around easily. He enjoys a daily walk or play session but won"t become destructive if you just lie around eating bonbons and playing with him. Chin enjoy playing, and they move with such grace and agility that they rarely disturb anything when they race through a home. These are sensitive dogs. They pick up on the emotions of the home and their owners and will shape their personality to match. If he lives in a home that is quiet and somber, the Japanese Chin will become quiet and reserved, yet still possess all the wonderful traits of a companion dog. If he lives in an active home, he will generally be lively and outgoing. Fun-loving and charming, the Chin can be addictive. People who love him can"t imagine life without him, and many can"t imagine life without two or three.
The Japanese Chin is catlike in many ways. The breed is commonly seen grooming itself by licking its paws and wiping its head. Also, they enjoy being up high and will perch on the back of couches and on tables. Considered to be an average shedder, the Japanese Chin requires a few minutes of brushing each day to remove loose hair and to keep the coat from tangling. Japanese Chin do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overexert themselves. Due to the breed"s flat face, Japanese Chin will often snort, sniffle, or reverse sneeze. Generally, a Japanese Chin is still able to breathe through this, but if the attack becomes severe, you can try gently stroke his neck. Japanese Chin do well in apartments. Although Japanese Chin are intelligent and eager to please, they require interesting, fun-filled training sessions. Otherwise, they get bored and will turn their attention to something more entertaining. Japanese Chin do very well with older children but are not recommended for homes with smaller children due to their small size. They can be seriously injured with minimal force. Japanese Chin are companion dogs who thrive when they are with the people they love. They should not live outside or in a kennel away from their family. Japanese Chin require a lower amount of exercise compared to other breeds but they do enjoy a daily walk or play in the yard. Japanese Chin don"t like being parted from their people, and separation anxiety is a common problem in the breed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Japanese Chin is an ancient breed that probably originated in the Chinese imperial court. Highly prized, he was often given as a gift to emissaries from other lands, and it was probably as a gift to the emperor of Japan that he made his way to that island nation which gave him his name. In Japan, the Chin was regarded not as a dog (inu) but as a separate being (chin). There, he was probably crossed with small spaniel-type dogs and eventually achieved the look he has today. The Japanese Chin remained unknown to the outside world until 1853 when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Uraga Harbor near Edo — now modern-day Tokyo — and introduced Japan to international trade. The Japanese Chin became a popular commodity and many were imported into Britain and the United States. Among the first American owners of the breed were President Franklin Pierce, then-Secretary-of-War Jefferson Davis, and Perry"s daughter, Caroline Perry Belmont. They became popular with people of wealth and nobility. In the United States, the Japanese Chin was known as the Japanese Spaniel and he kept that name until 1977.
The Japanese Chin is sturdily built but with a refined appearance. He stands 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder and weighs between 4 and 9 pounds.
The personality of the Japanese Chin is a true indicator of the depth that these dogs possess. In general, he"s a happy and charming dog who is affectionate and intelligent. He"s talkative, but not barky. Chin people say their dogs like to "sing" and will chatter to announce the arrival of guests or strangers. Chin are so sensitive to their environments and the emotions of their people that they have been known to shape their personality around them. If he lives in a home that is quiet and somber, the Japanese Chin will become reserved. If he lives in an active home, he will do his part to keep the action lively. The Japanese Chin is always devoted to his people and may suffer from separation anxiety. He is a pleasant dog who shows love and affection to everyone in his life, but he can be shy when exposed to new people or situations.
Chin are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Chin will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chin, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Atrioventricular Endocardiosis: This degenerative disease affects the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart. It occurs when polysaccharide deposits distort the shape of the valves and cause them to leak. This can lead to heart failure. A change in diet and exercise may be necessary. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They"re an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and five being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Japanese Chin has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.
Japanese Chin require very little exercise. They are happy with a daily walk or a nice play session but they tend to require little else. Training can be slightly difficult since they have a mind of their own and become bored with repetitious training. When they like you, however, they"ll work hard to please you. When they do wrong, a firm tone of voice is all you need to set them straight. Stronger corrections will only backfire and cause your Chin to stubbornly stand his ground. They can be difficult to housetrain but with patience and consistency, you can generally expect them to be housetrained by 4 months of age. Japanese Chin are companion dogs and should not live outdoors or in kennels. They become very attached to their people, and many suffer from separation anxiety. With their low exercise needs, Japanese Chin make wonderful apartment residents. The neck of the Japanese Chin is very delicate and it is strongly suggested that you use a harness instead of a collar when walking him.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. It is important when you are feeding your Japanese Chin that use choose a food that is high in fiber. Japanese Chin can suffer from impacted anal glands when their diet lacks good dietary fiber. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Chin, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Japanese Chin has an abundant coat that"s silky to the touch. It"s moderately long with a thick mane, feathered ears, a plumed tail, feathering on the back of the front legs, and light feathering that resembles culottes on the rear legs. The head, face, and forelegs are covered with short hair. Japanese Chin can have coats that are black and white, red and white, or black and white with tan points. Japanese Chin are a very clean breed and do not require regular baths. Once a month is plenty. Dry shampoos will generally keep them looking and smelling great. You can also use a mild shampoo, towel them until they"re almost dry, brush the coat upward and outward with a pin brush, and voila! They"re good to go. Chin do shed, but weekly brushing will help keep the hair from flying around your house. A quick daily brushing with a pin brush will help keep hair from tangling. Brush your Japanese Chin"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Japanese Chin to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Although the Japanese Chin is a gentle dog, he is not recommended for homes where there are young children. He can be easily hurt by an overexuberant child. The breed does well with older children who understand how to properly handle a dog. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Japanese Chin get along well with other dogs and cats, but they must be protected from larger dogs who could accidentally injure them in play. A cat"s claws can injure their large eyes, so it"s important to make sure everyone plays nicely together.

The official history of the Jindo is up for debate since there is no written account. However, most experts agree that this breed has been in the Jindo province for many centuries. There is no proof of how the dog originated on the island of Jindo, though the most popular theory states that they may be descended from Mongolian dogs brought to Korea during the 1270 A.D. Mongol invasion. Despite the many theories, there is evidence that Jindos have existed in Korea for at least 1,500 years. In 1962, they were designated as the 53rd National Treasure. This status makes it difficult to export a purebred outside of South Korea, though the first of this breed appeared in the United States in the 1980s. Despite their rarity in the States, they became recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1998. The Jindo Dogs Guild of Korea is responsible for monitoring the entire Jindo population. Beginning in 2008, this organizations issues certificated to purebreds. The breed has been long known in Korea for its hunting abilities. A pack of well-trained Jindos is an invaluable resource to a hunter, who serves as the pack leaders. Jindos will prey on medium to large prey, sometimes independent of their owners. They also serve as great guard dogs, protecting their owners in case of attack. Due to these traits, the Jindo was appropriated by militaries, police departments, and even search and rescue teams. It was believed that their ferocity and high trainability would make them a reliable fit for search and rescue positions. Unfortunately, the opposite proved to be true. In 2009, Bak Nam-sun spoke in an interview on the unfit nature of Jindos for search and rescue teams. It turns out that the dogs’ loyalty to one single owner was too strong for the multiple handlers of search and rescue teams. Their hunting instincts also often interfered with the search missions. Similarly, Son Min Suk stated in 2010 that German Shepherds were better military dogs. Again, the Jindo’s loyalty to their first trainer or their original home proved to be too strong to be effective in a military setting. Later that year, the Los Angeles Police Department discovered the same issues after adopting four Jindos from South Korea; the dogs were too eager to please their first trainers and were easily distracted because of it. Nowadays, the Jindo is still highly respected and popular throughout Korea. Despite being unfit for military and police positions, these dogs still make loyal and intelligent pets to individuals and families alike.
The Jindo is notorious for being both loyal and intelligent. Their pack mentality lends itself to easy training and an eagerness to please. However, their intelligence leads them to demand respect before giving their unwavering loyalty to their owners. They can be stubborn in the early stages of training and require patience. Once respect has been earned, there are few breeds that surpass the loyalty of the Jindo. They are quick to train and can learn even the most complicated tricks and agility sequences with ease. One of the more challenging aspect of the Jindo is their need for socialization. Jindos are overall a gentle and loving breed, but they are wary of strangers. Their loyalty disposes them to be furiously protective which can present itself as aggression in poorly socialized dogs. Early socialization with other animals, children, and strangers will quickly ease this concern.

Jindos should be allowed indoors, close to their owners. They do not do well if relegated alone outside for long periods of time. They are loyal and intelligent and form deep bonds with humans based on mutual trust and respect. When left alone, they can get bored and lonely and may become destructive, especially at young ages. Due to their high intelligence, Jindos need patience during early training stages. They are quick to train once their stubbornness has been surpassed. Especially important to training is the need for early socialization. Jindos can show signs of aggression and suspicion towards strangers if not properly socialized at an early age.
Jindos have digestive tracks optimized for a carnivorous diet. As such, standard or cheap commercial dog food may not be the best choice for this breed. Foods high in corn are particularly bad for Jindos. A healthy and accessible option for Jindos include home-cooked meals with natural ingredients and special supplements. A good second choice is all-natural, high-quality, commercially produced foods. For more detailed information, or if you are unsure on what to buy, always check with your vet. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference, the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.
The Jindo is recognized by the UKC in six different colors: white, fawn, red, brindle, grey, black, and black and tan. The Jindo are naturally incredibly clean dogs. They have self-cleaning coats and do not need to be bathed frequently. They even groom themselves like cats. The downside of this is that they also shed profusely, especially in hot weather with their double coat.  These dogs have no special grooming needs, making them fairly low maintenance in this department.
Jindos need to be socialized early if they will be exposed to children and other pets. While the Jindo are not known for being aggressive, they have been called an especially suspicious breed. They are fiercely protective of their owners, frequently to whatever ends they feel necessary. Coupled with a prey instinct, careful and patient training is a must for the social Jindo. At the same time, a properly socialized Jindo becomes very confident, gentle, and tolerant. While they are still independent and do not appreciate being challenged, with proper training they will not respond with aggression or violence. If you are unsure of how to properly train your Jindo, or want a helping hand, consider professional obedience training around six months of age.

The Keeshond (pronounced KAYZ-hawnd) is a medium-sized dog with an impressive gray, black, and cream coat and a massive, plumed tail. He was known for years as the "Dutch Barge Dog" because of his role as companion and guardian on barges and small boats on Holland"s many canals and rivers. While the Keeshond will issue a stern bark when someone approaches his property, he"s such a love that he"ll readily accept anyone his owner brings into the household. In truth, he isn"t a very effective guard dog. The Keeshond is a fan of cool weather. He likes spending time outside when the weather is crisp. However, he isn"t a backyard dog; he"s too people-oriented for that. He needs to live inside with his family and participate in all their activities. The Keeshond loves children and plays nicely with them (although, of course, adults should always supervise interactions between kids and any dog). The Keeshond also gets along well other dogs and pets if he is introduced to them at a young age. Besides being an excellent family pet, today"s Keeshond can strut his stuff in the conformation ring, obedience ring, and rally competition. He"s also sure-footed, which makes him a great agility competitor.
The Keeshond is never reluctant to issue a warning bark to alert his family to strangers. His propensity to bark can be a problem if he"s left alone too much and becomes bored. The best way to make a Keeshond miserable is to keep him separated from his family. He was bred to be a companion, and he needs to be part of family life. If you don"t want a dog joining in family barbeques, card games, or movie time, consider a more independent breed. Keeping the Keeshond coat in good condition isn"t terribly difficult, but the breed does shed like crazy once or twice or year. Luckily, frequent bathing isn"t usually needed — the Keeshond scores low on doggie odor. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Keeshond is a close cousin to the Samoyed, Chow, Norwegian Elkhound, Finnish Spitz, and Pomeranian. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Keeshond was a companion and watchdog on small vessels called rijnaken on the Rhine River. The Keeshond became the best-loved dog of Holland during a time of political unrest. Holland was divided into two factions: the prinsgezinden, or followers of the Prince of Orange, and the patriotten, or patriots. The patriots were led by one Cornelius de Gyselaer, who had a spitz-type dog named Kees as his constant companion. De Gyselaer"s followers were derisively referred to as Keezen by the opposing Orange party. The Keeshond became a symbol of the rebel party, and the breed became popular among ordinary people. In time, the followers of the Prince of Orange overthrew the rebel party and the Keeshond fell into disfavor as the representative of a lost cause; many dogs were destroyed. Some survived on Dutch farms and on barges around Amsterdam. The breed was rediscovered in 1905 by a Miss Hamilton-Fletcher (later to become Mrs. Wingfield-Digby). She convinced her parents to take home two puppies. These dogs were taken to England and became the foundation stock for the breed"s introduction outside of Holland. Mrs. Wingfield-Digby and Mrs. Alice Gatacre aroused interest in the breed in England and, in 1926, the English breed club was formed. The decline of the Keeshond in Holland continued until 1920, when Baroness van Hardenbroek became interested in the breed. The Baroness found that the dogs were still kept by riverboat captains, farmers, and working people. She began breeding Keeshonds and spread their story throughout Europe. Within 10 years, the Dutch Keeshond Club was formed. The first American litter of Keeshonds was bred in 1929 by Carl Hinderer. The first Keeshond was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1930 in the Non-Sporting Group, and the Keeshond Club of America was formed in 1935.
Males stand 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 45 pounds. Females stand 17 inches tall and weigh approximately 35 pounds.
The Keeshond was bred more to be a companion than a watchdog. He"s not a hunter, nor does he have an innate desire for any special job. He is, first and foremost, a devoted friend. He"s also intelligent and highly trainable. He"s so smart, in fact, that he can be a little mischievous. Expect the unexpected with these fellows. Despite this, the breed easily learns proper canine manners and can do well in the obedience ring. A Keeshond is a lively, alert dog, full of personality. When he"s excited or happy, he likes to share his joy with everyone, often spinning in circles. His outgoing personality, as well as his love of adults and children alike, endears him to all. As with every dog, the Keeshond needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Keeshond puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Keeshonds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Keeshonds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this is an extremely serious condition caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones. Most affected dogs have a poor appetite, vomit, and are lethargic. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are "hungry" even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try and compensate, but he"ll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Keeshond is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Keeshonds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Having been bred first for life on a barge and later as a companion dog, the Keeshond has learned how to be happy in a relatively small space. He can live cheerfully in an apartment, a home with a large yard, or on a boat. More important than space is the Keeshond"s need to live in the house with his family. Because he"s a companion breed, it"s essential that he be allowed to share as many aspects of his owners" lives as possible. If left unattended in the yard for hours on end, with little or no contact with his family, he"ll become bored and his natural propensity to bark will intensify. He can become a nuisance barker if allowed. If you don"t plan on spending quality family time with your Keeshond in the house on a daily basis, you should consider a different breed. While every dog benefits from exercise, the Keeshond does not require a great deal of it. He isn"t generally considered to be the breed of choice for long-distance runners, for example. For your own health as well his, though, plan on at least one vigorous daily walk. The Keeshond is not fond of hot climates; he"s happiest and most comfortable in cool weather. On hot days, keep him inside in an air-conditioned house or near fans. Some Keeshonds will also enjoy lounging in a small children"s wading pool filled with cool water.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Keeshond in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Keeshond, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Keeshond look is fabulous, with his thick, double top coat, woolly undercoat, and a longer outer (or guard) coat. His mane is more profuse in males than in females. His hindquarters have "trousers," longer hair down to the hocks. His tail is like a plume set on a lady"s hat. The Keeshond color is a combination of cream, black, and gray. He has unique facial markings that seem to form spectacles, with a delicate, dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the ear. Surprisingly, the Keeshond"s full coat is relatively easy to maintain. Matting isn"t a severe problem, as long as you brush him at least twice a week. He does shed profusely twice a year, when he "blows" or sheds his entire undercoat all at once. This shedding period can be intense and can last for three weeks. Keeshonds are relatively clean dogs; their doggie odor is minimal. Bathing is necessary about every three months or so (more often, of course, if he rolls in something smelly or plays in mud). Given the breed"s heavy coat and intolerance to heat, you might think it"s wise to shave down the coat in the summer. Not so — the coat actually insulates, keeping the Keeshond cool and protecting him from sunburn. Brush, don"t shave. Trim his nails once a month, and his ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Keeshond"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Keeshond to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Keeshond is a great pet for families with children. He"s a playful, good-natured companion for kids of all ages. And as long as he is well socialized and well trained, the Keeshond gets along well with other dogs and pets. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Consider adopting a Keeshond from a rescue group before going to a breeder. The Keeshond Club of America

This working-class dog is definitely all terrier: alert, resourceful, muscular, and always ready for action. His defining characteristic, however, is his coat: blue, with a gray tint (though it doesn"t start out that way). Puppies are often born black, transitioning through dark blue, brown, gray, and combinations of these colors until they reach a mature blue-gray color at about 18 months of age. His V-shaped ears, black nose, and the mop of hair that falls over his eyes further distinguish his look. The Kerry Blue Terrier is typically good-natured with people of all ages, including children. He is an excellent family dog who enjoys participating in all family activities and he is happiest when he is with those he loves. He makes a good watchdog too, ready to warn his family of intruders or anything out of the ordinary. The Kerry Blue is not especially vocal, but when he barks, he sounds intimidating. The Kerry Blue is not especially good-natured with other dogs. In fact, he is prone to dog aggression (fighting with other dogs), especially if he"s intact. Early Kerry Blue Terriers were even more aggressive than those found today. Conscientious breeders have worked hard to retain the liveliness of the breed while toning down their natural inclination to aggression. Good breeding, combined with proper socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people) and training, helps prevent dog aggression, but watch out. This is not a dog to back down from a fight. The Kerry Blue is loyal and affectionate toward his family, but he is strong willed. He needs an equally strong-willed owner, one who can kindly and consistently show leadership. The Kerry Blue will walk all over a wishy-washy human, which is why he is not always recommended for first-time dog owners. Not surprisingly, the working Kerry Blue is an active dog who needs a great deal of exercise every day. (If he is trained and socialized not to fight with other dogs, he makes an excellent jogging, hiking, and bicycling companion.) Grooming is another daily activity. Although the Kerry Blue doesn"t shed and is relatively odor-free, he must be brushed every day to prevent matting and to keep his coat neat and clean. It"s not difficult to be captivated by this proud dog from Ireland with the blue-gray coat. However, in considering a Kerry Blue, it"s important to realize he has many traits similar to all terriers: the love of digging, a bit of an attitude, and a high prey drive. These traits must be taken in account when considering adding him to the family.
The Kerry Blue Terry is a quick study, though he can be strong willed at times. You"ll need a lot of patience and firmness, plus a good sense of humor, when training this breed. The Kerry Blue is friendly to people, but his distaste for other dogs is well known. He can be aggressive and quarrelsome. Owners must be vigilant when taking the Kerry Blue in public. If he"s socialized and well trained, he probably won"t pick a fight, but he might try to end it if he"s taunted. Keeping your Kerry Blue groomed is expensive and, if you do it yourself, it"s hard work. Like all terriers, the Kerry Blue can be feisty. He loves to dig, chase, chew, and sometimes bark. This is an active breed. He needs plenty of exercise, every day. A yard to play in is best, combined with daily walks. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Ireland — specifically, the mountainous area of County Kerry — is the birthplace of the Kerry Blue Terrier. He was originally a working terrier, hunting small game and birds, killing rodents, and guarding his homestead. He was used successfully for herding sheep and cattle. Eventually, the breed was shown in conformation and highly favored. English fanciers saw potential, too, and the breed was recognized by the Kennel Club. Aggressiveness was originally was bred into the Kerry Blues intentionally. In early dog shows, the Irish Kennel Club required each to pass a "gameness" test before he could be judged. The tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay. From these tests, the Kerry Blue earned the nickname "Blue Devil." No one really knows who brought the first Kerry Blue to the United States. He was thought to have appeared at the Westminster show in 1922, and the breed was officially recognized by the Amercian Kennel Club in 1924. During the Westminster show of 1926, a group of fanciers met at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City and organized the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America. In the early 1900s, Irish patriot Michael Collins introduced legislation to name the Kerry Blue the National Dog of Ireland. His own Kerry Blue was named Convict 225. Collins was murdered, however, before the legislation could be passed, and after his death, interest in the initiative was lost.
Males stand 18 to 19.5 inches tall. Females stand 17.5 to 19 inches tall. Males and females weigh 33 to 40 pounds.
The Kerry Blue is a hard-working, independent, and athletic dog with plenty of energy and stamina. Like most terriers, he is prone to dig, chase, and bark (occasionally). If you are considering a Kerry Blue, think about whether or not you are willing to live with his propensity toward these behaviors. If so, you will be delighted with the Kerry Blue"s fun-loving, even silly, attitude. The Kerry Blue is an active breed, and he needs plenty of exercise — mental and physical. Don"t leave him alone for long periods of time, or he is likely to become bored, which leads to the destructive behaviors mentioned above. Training is essential to teach him proper canine manners. And as delightful as he is, the Kerry Blue does not get along well with others. He tends to fight with other dogs and chase small animals he perceives as prey. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Kerry Blue needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Kerry Blue puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Kerry Blue are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kerry Blue will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Kerry Blue, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Skin Cysts: It"s not unusual for the Kerry Blue to develop lumps and bumps, usually epidermal cysts or sebaceous gland cysts that don"t cause a problem. If a cyst ruptures, however, it can become infected. Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Keratoses: Keratoses (of the nose and foot) is the development of corns, warts, and calluses on the feet or nose. Often painful, corns can be inherited and are associated with thin pads or flat feet. Keratoses can be removed surgically or treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Kerry Blues and can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care. Chronic Otitis Externa: This is a chronic infection of the outer ear canal, often caused by excessive hair in the ear that fosters bacterial and fungal growth. The Kerry Blue can be prone to infection. Treatment includes cleaning the ears and plucking the hair growing inside the canal. Progressive Neuronal Abiotrophy (PNA): This is a rare, inherited nerve disorder. Symptoms usually appear when the dog is between 2 and 6 months of age. By the time the dog is a year old, he can"t stand up. There is no treatment, nor are there any tests that determine if breeding dogs are carriers of the condition. Research is underway to create testing for breeding stock. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Factor Xl Deficiency (Plasma Thromboplastin Antecedent Deficiency): This is a rare inherited blood clotting abnormality that is characterized by severe bleeding after surgery or trauma. As the name implies, it"s caused by a deficiency of the factor XI in the blood-clotting mechanism.
The Kerry Blue Terrier is a powerful, agile, and athletic dog who requires regular exercise. While some Kerry Blues will exercise themselves in a securely fenced back yard, others do not. Not only will a daily walk maintain muscle tone and keep a Kerry fit and trim, it will provide the necessary stimulation and socialization to keep him mentally alert. The Kerry Blue who lives in an apartment or condo requires at least three daily walks, even if it"s raining or the temperature is below freezing. Training and socialization is essential for the Kerry Blue, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Kerry Blue with you to many different places — the pet supply store, outdoor events, or long walks in busy parks — anywhere there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see. Remember, though, that he has a tendency to quarrel with other dogs. Also: if you don"t have children, but may in the next few years, the Kerry Blue must be socialized early to them. The Kerry has a mind of his own and requires a firm but loving hand to show what is expected from him. He instinctively wants to please, and with positive reinforcement and praise, learns quickly. Harsher techniques aren"t useful with a Kerry, because despite his toughness, he is surprisingly sensitive.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Kerry Blue in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Kerry Blue, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Kerry Blue coat is soft, dense and wavy, and though considered non-shedding, the coat is high maintenance. He needs daily brushing, plus trimming and bathing every four to six weeks. Most owners opt to hire a professional groomer to trim the Kerry Blue, though finding one who knows the correct Kerry trim can be difficult. An uncommon breed, the average groomer doesn"t have much experience with it; you might end up with your Kerry Blue looking like a Schnauzer or a Poodle. Your best option is to choose a groomer who certified with a national certifying agency. While certification is not mandated legally (like kennel licensing), it does show ongoing education. Also, owners can find a state-by-state listing of experienced groomers at The Kerry Blue Foundation website. Brush your Kerry Blue"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Kerry Blue to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Kerry Blue loves kids, and because he is a sturdy dog, he can take a few knocks if the play gets rough. He is good-natured, and isn"t normally grouchy with children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He is grouchy, even aggressive, with other dogs, though with socialization and training — and altering — this tendency can be minimized. Never let your guard down, though, when the Kerry Blue is around other dogs, especially those unfamiliar to him. The Kerry Blue isn"t especially fond of small animals either, given his strong prey drive. His instinct tells him to chase, so keep him leashed in public. The best way to ensure he"ll get along with cats or small mammals in his home is to raise him with them and introduce them properly. Following that, close supervision is advised.

The Komondor may look like a mop on four legs, but beneath all that hair, there"s a big dog with a big personality. Originally bred to guard livestock — a job he still excels at — the Komondor is intelligent, independent, and highly protective. In fact, he enjoys nothing more than watching over his family. This may pose a couple of problems. For one, it can be unnerving to have a dog sit and stare at you as you go about your day. For another, the Komondor"s protective instincts and suspicion of strangers can lead to trouble (and lawsuits) if your dog attacks someone he perceives as a threat. Obviously, this dog comes with responsibilities. You need to be a confident leader to win the respect of your Komondor. The meek, and the inexperienced dog owner, need not apply. You"ll have to socialize your Komondor well — exposing him to lots of different people, situations, and other animals — from an early age so he knows how to behave around them. And you"ll have to take pains to introduce your Komondor to people who are permitted in your home. Once a Komondor accepts the newcomer, he"ll always remember him and treat him as a member of his flock, one more person to watch over. You"ll also need to be careful around other dogs. Komondorok can be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know, and some aren"t capable of sharing a home with another canine, no matter how hard you to try to make everyone get along. However, they may have excellent relations with cats and livestock. Nor is the Komondor"s coat care an easy proposition. Their trademark cords don"t need brushing, but they must be kept free of parasites and dirt. And if it gets damp, the Komondor"s coat can develop an unpleasant mildew odor. True to his working dog heritage, the Komondor is a smart cookie who learns quickly with the right trainer — that is, one who engages his mind and works with his independent nature rather than against it. With repetitive training techniques, he gets bored. The Komondor will ignore commands that seem unnecessary, so pick your battles. The Komondor comes with lots of benefits in addition to the responsibilities. This loyal breed will happily spend his days under or on your feet, serving as companion, friend, and guardian.
Komondor are rare, but unethical backyard breeders and puppy mills do breed them. It"s important to find a good breeder to make sure you don"t get a puppy who will develop health or behavior problems. Although an apartment or condo is not the ideal living space for a Komondor, he can adjust to that lifestyle if he receives daily exercise and is trained not to bark excessively. This strong-willed dog needs a confident owner who can provide leadership the Komondor will respect. This isn"t a good choice for the first-time dog owner. Although Komondor shouldn"t be brushed, their coat needs extensive care to keep its white color and to stay free of dirt, debris, and parasites. If you want your Komondor"s coat to stay clean, he should sleep indoors. Komondor are barkers and suspicious of most things they see or hear. The breed is an excellent watch dog for both home and livestock and was originally developed for this role. Komondor can be aggressive to other dogs. Komondor aren"t high-energy, and are happy just watching and following you around the house. But they still need daily exercise of at least a few walks per day to keep them healthy and at their proper weight. A high fence is required to prevent the Komondor from attempting to expand his territory, a common habit of guard dogs. The Komondor is happiest when he"s working. He"s ideal for guarding livestock, but any job will give him the mental exercise he needs. Although Komondor historically spent their time outside protecting the flock, they do need time inside with their family. Like any dog, a Komondor can become aggressive, fearful, or aloof when deprived of human company.
The earliest written description of the Komondor dates back to the 16th century, but the breed was around long before that, guarding livestock herds in his native Hungary. The Komondor is believed to be descended from the Russian Owtcharka, another breed of sheepdog. Komondor had a special advantage in their job. With their white, corded coats, they closely resembled their flocks — large sheep with white, curly wool — and were able to mingle with them unseen by predators until it was too late. As with many breeds, World War II left the Komondor on the brink of extinction. After the war, fanciers tried to return the breed to its original numbers, but it remained rare and largely unknown. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1937, but there were few Komondor outside Hungary until after 1962. The Komondor ranks 144th in popularity among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club. He still serves as a livestock guardian, but he"s now known as a companion dog as well.
The Komondor male stands 27.5 inches tall and up and weighs 100 or more pounds; a female is 25.5 tall and weighs 80 or more pounds.
Komondor puppies take a long time to reach maturity — generally three years or so — but when they do, they have a calm, devoted personality. They"re intelligent, independent, and fiercely protective, willing to rise to the challenge of defending home and family. Komondor are wary of strangers and can be aggressive to other dogs. These traits, plus their large size, make them a bad match for first-time or timid owners. Komondor need early and extensive socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — starting in early puppyhood. Enrolling your Komondor in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Keep up his socialization by continually exposing him to lots of different people. Invite visitors over regularly and take him along on outings and walks.
Komondor are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Komondor will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Komondor, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or PennHIP clearances for hips. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. Hip Dysplasia: This degenerative disease occurs when the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development and is found in many breeds of dogs. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Komondor has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically when the dog reaches maturity. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated.
When he"s young, this intelligent breed is surprisingly easy to train. That ease is often short lived, however, and turns into frustration when the apt pupil turns into a stubborn student. Komondor are independent as well as smart. The key to training a Komondor is not force or repetition, but making training fun for both owner and dog. The Komondor"s ability to think for himself will lead him to decide that some commands are worth learning, some aren"t worth repeating, and some are okay only once in a while. He becomes bored easily, so make each training session different. Komondor have moderate exercise needs and are satisfied with two or three short walks daily or playtime in the yard. They need a securely fenced yard to help them define their territory and, because they"re so protective, to prevent other people and animals from entering that territory.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Komondor are prone to bloat, a potentially life-threatening condition. To help prevent bloat, feed two or three small meals daily rather than one large meal. To keep a Komondor"s weight at a normal level, feed him at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your Komondor will be just as happy to get a fingernail-sized training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Komondor, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Komondor has a wonderfully unique coat. During puppyhood, he has soft curls that grow heavy as he matures, developing into long, feltlike cords that resemble the strands of a mop. The undercoat is soft and woolly, the topcoat coarse. Puppies have a cream or buff shading to their coats, but this color fades to white as they grow up. The Komondor coat doesn"t need brushing, but it"s definitely not maintenance-free. When the cords begin forming at eight to 12 months of age — a process in which the soft undercoat is trapped by the topcoat — it"s essential to keep the hair clean and dry so it doesn"t get dirty and discolored. The cords may not completely form until the dog is 2 years old. The cords must be separated regularly to prevent matting and to remove debris or dirt. Trimming around the mouth is suggested to avoid staining from food. And bathing and drying a Komondor is an all-day affair. Floor fans are excellent for post-bath drying, and many Komondorok will laze around in front of a fan. The coat can be trimmed short for ease of maintenance, although this takes away from the breed"s distinctive appearance. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Komondor"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Komondor jumps up to greet you. Start getting your Komondor used to being examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Komondor can be good companions to children in their own family, but may have difficulty accepting visiting children. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always supervise Komondor when they"re with children, and never leave them alone with young children. They"re livestock guardians, not babysitters. Even when exposed to them often, Komondor are generally not fond of other dogs. They do best in a single-dog home but can learn to get along with cats. They"re always pleased to have livestock to guard. That is, after all, their purpose in life.
Sometimes Komondorok are acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs may end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Contact rescue organizations for more information about available dogs and adoption requirements. Komondor Club of America Rescue

No, the name doesn"t translate to cookie dog, although he no doubt enjoys them as much as any other breed. Originating in the Netherlands, this cheerful spaniel appears in paintings dating back to the sixteenth century. He served as a hunting dog, luring ducks within range so they can be shot or tagged, much like the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. In fact, the Kooiker is thought to be the ancestor of the Toller. Friendly, good-natured, and alert, the Kooiker is an excellent family companion with watch dog skills as well as athletic ability that makes him a natural at games such as agility and flyball. As a retriever, he also loves playing fetch, especially in the water. His exercise needs are adaptable: A long, slow stroll around the block or a strenuous hike will suit him equally well. Just be sure he"s conditioned first before you start him on any heavy exercise. Introduce the Kooiker to cats or other dogs when he"s young and he"ll get along fine with them. Expect him to be reserved toward strangers but eagerly welcoming of friends and family. The Kooiker is smart and willing to learn, so take advantage of those traits and begin training early.

The Kuvasz (pronounced KOO-vahss; the plural is Kuvaszok, pronounced KOO-vah-sock) is probably the oldest of the three ancient Hungarian breeds. He has a regal bearing and a history (which includes an association with Count Dracula himself) as complex as his personality. His almond-shaped eyes, black nose, and dense white fur make him an eye-catching breed. So does his size. Males can weigh up to 115 pounds or even more. They"re sturdy and well-muscled, very strong with great endurance, yet elegant. Many think the Kuvasz moves like a wolf, with a powerful, graceful stride. When he trots or runs, he seems to glide, with little up-and-down movement of the body. Because his gait is so effortless, he"s capable of trotting for 15 miles or more without tiring. A Kuvasz"s white coat is beautiful to behold, and has at times contributed to the breed"s popularity as a "fashion dog." But they were bred to have white coats for reasons other than beauty: Their color helped shepards distinguish their dogs from wolves. The Kuvasz can be a wonderful, loyal, and patient companion, but he"s not for everyone. Because he was bred to guard, he can be aloof, independent, and suspicious of strangers. Your Kuvasz will be polite to welcomed guests, but no more — regardless of how hard the strangers try to befriend him. His almost fanatical loyalty makes him very protective; he"s always alert for any signs of danger, and when aroused, he can move with surprising speed given his size. Kuvaszok are extremely intelligent, but they aren"t easy to train. Their fierce independence makes them a challenge even for experienced dog owners. Puppies are playful well into adolescence, but older dogs usually are calm and reserved. Excessive barking, however, can be a problem at any age, depending on the individual dog. Because they"re so intelligent, protective, and strong, it"s especially important to socialize and train your Kuvasz starting at a young age. In true working dog spirit, Kuvaszok like to have a job to do, whether it"s watching over livestock or watching over your children. They"re typically gentle with kids and love to play with them. Mature dogs seem to understand their great strength, but Kuvaszok puppies, like children, often don"t know their limits, so you should always supervise the play of puppies and children. Kuvaszok are active dogs who wouldn"t do well in an apartment or house without a yard. If kept in a kennel or, worse, tethered or chained, they can become aggressive. Kuvaszok are determined and have a high tolerance to pain, so an underground electronic fence probably wouldn"t hold them if they really wanted to run free. But you shouldn"t always keep them outdoors. Let them inside so they can be with their family. Everyone will enjoy it.
Kuvaszok require a confident, experienced owner, one who gains their respect and understands their independent nature. Kuvaszok shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Brushing them at least once a week, and preferably every two to three days, is recommended. Like many large dogs, the Kuvasz may develop joint problems if exercised too much while he"s still growing. Don"t push your Kuvasz to over-exercise, jump excessively, or go up and down stairs too often until he"s passed his second birthday. Kuvaszok are suspicious of strangers and can be overly protective. Obedience training is imperative when you own a large guarding dog such as a Kuvasz. Although he"s pretty self-sufficient, a Kuvasz doesn"t like to be kept apart from his family. Like all dogs, he does best spending at least part of his time with you in the house rather than being left alone in the backyard. There really is no such thing as a "good backyard dog." Your Kuvasz can become aggressive and frustrated if kenneled, tethered, or chained. This is a breed that needs to run. He needs a large, fenced yard as well as a long daily walk or run once he"s physically mature. Kuvaszok are intelligent and like many guarding dogs, they think for themselves. Training can be difficult and requires a lot of patience, time, and consistency. Although they"re very gentle with children if they were raised with them, Kuvaszok puppies can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock over a small child. Your Kuvasz may consider any children other than the kids in your family to be threats. Opt to be safe rather than sorry, and when other kids come over to play, watch your Kuvasz carefully or put him in a secure area. Never allow anyone to reprimand your Kuvasz. If he feels that the person who"s reprimanding him isn"t "worthy" to do so, he will resent it.
The Kuvasz is perhaps the oldest of the three ancient dog breeds of Hungary, the other two being the Puli and the Komondor. They may have arrived with the Magyar tribes who invaded Hungary some 1,200 years ago, and one Hungarian dog historian posits that they were there many centuries earlier. The name Kuvasz is said to be a corruption of the Turkish word kawasz, meaning bodyguard. Another theory suggests that it comes from a Sumerian word, ku assa, referring to a dog that guarded and ran alongside horses and horsemen. Whatever their origin, by the 15th century, Kuvaszok were highly prized in Hungary as guard dogs, especially by King Matthias. Matthias was crowned on March 29, 1464 when he was just 15 years old. Despite his youth, Matthias was a shrewd and wise military leader. He built a large army of mercenaries that was able to beat back the Ottomans and expand the holdings of the Kingdom of Hungary. As might be expected in such turbulent times, palace intrigue was rampant. Plots and assassination attempts were commonplace. It was a time when a king couldn"t even trust his own family, but Matthias felt secure so long as his Kuvaszok were close by. It"s said that he took a brace of Kuvaszok with him wherever he went, even to his sleeping chambers. Matthias built huge kennels, housing hundreds of Kuvaszok on his estate at Siebenbuergen. In addition to protecting the king, these dogs were used to guard the estate"s livestock and sometimes to hunt large game, such as bear and wolves. The Kuvaszok were highly prized, and sometimes King Matthias would give a puppy to a visiting noble. Because they were associated with royalty, Kuvaszok became very popular. One noble who received such a gift was Vlad Dracula, the Prince of Wallachia. Vlad (also known as Vlad the Impaler, after his preferred method of torture) was a vassal of King Matthias at different times. At one point, King Matthias imprisoned Vlad in a royal tower for many years. Vlad worked his way back into the good graces of the king, and after his release, reportedly married a member of the royal family — probably a cousin of King Matthias. As a wedding gift, the king reportedly gave Vlad Dracula and his bride two Kuvaszok. After King Matthias died, the breed declined in popularity among royal and noble families, but continued his traditional role of protecting livestock for farmers and horsemen. In the late 1800s, breeders took an interest in standardizing the breed. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Kuvasz became the most fashionable large dog in Hungary and western Europe. During World War II, however, like many breeds, the Kuvasz nearly went extinct. Food shortages took their toll, and many kennels cut back or stopped breeding. When Nazi, then Soviet, soldiers moved through Hungary, brave Kuvaszok were often shot trying to protect their families and livestock. Some officers took Kuvaszok home with them, but even so, the breed was nearly wiped out. By the end of the war, there were fewer than 30 Kuvazok to be found in Hungary. Many Kuvasz fanciers were dead. The Russians who occupied Hungary looked upon dog breeding as a luxury hobby of aristocrats and punished breeders. Despite these hardships, breeders met in secret, selling puppies and dogs for cigarettes and food. But because food was still in short supply, Kuvaszok, like other large breeds with hearty appetites, were not popular. Since the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, conditions have steadily improved in Hungary and the Kuvasz has begun to regain his popularity. Today, there are active Kuvasz breed clubs scattered throughout Europe. It has been a struggle, however, because the near extinction left a very small gene pool from which to rebuild the breed, forcing some breeders to use other dogs, such as Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs. Kuvasz were first shown at a dog show in 1883 when Count d"Esterházy, a strong supporter of the breed, displayed two Kuvaszok in Vienna. In 1884, the first Hungarian standard for the breed was written. In 1931, the first Kuvasz was registered in the U.S. The Kuvasz Club of America (KCA) was established in 1966, and granted status as the official breed club in America by the American Kennel Club in 1993. Today, the breed ranks 134th in popularity among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males are usually 28 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 to 115 pounds. Females are 26 to 28 inches tall and weigh 70 to 90 pounds.
The Kuvasz is a spirited dog of keen intelligence, determination, courage, and curiosity, sensitive to praise and blame. He"s devoted to protecting his family, especially children, and is suspicious of strangers. If a family member appears to be in danger, he acts on his own initiative. Adult Kuvaszok are gentle and patient with children, but puppies can be too rambunctious for young kids. This is a bold and independent dog who needs confident, patient training. This isn"t the breed for a first-time or timid dog owner.
Kuvaszok are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kuvaszok will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Kuvaszok, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip and elbow dysplasia (with a score of fair or better) and hypothyroidism. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than two years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old. The following conditions may affect Kuvaszok: Canine hip dysplasia: This is a condition where the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by using the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn"t be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. There are many new treatments that can help your dog if hip dysplasia is found. Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD): This is a degeneration of bone that lies beneath the cartilage layer of joints. It"s often seen in young, fast-growing dogs of the larger breeds. X-rays often are inconclusive. OCD usually appears during the growth phase of a young dog (six to nine months of age) and can affect the shoulder, ankle, or elbow joint. Because it is painful, the dog limps. Jumping off furniture and being overweight can contribute to the problem. Your vet may recommend complete rest and limited play for several weeks or surgery to remove torn cartilage pieces. von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease lead normal lives. Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Kuvaszok, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, or exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised food dishes and certain types of food might also be factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.
Kuvaszok are active dogs who need a lot of exercise, and they"re not suited to apartments or homes without access to a large, fenced yard. Even with a yard, they need exercise such as long walks or runs once they"re physically mature. When left alone for long stretches, they can become destructive or aggressive. Because of their dense coats, Kuvaszok can stay outdoors in temperate to cold climates so long as they have shelter, water, and food. Like any dog, however, they also need access to the house, so they can be close to their family. Warm weather and high humidity make them uncomfortable.
Recommended daily amount: 2.75 to 3.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Kuvasz in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Kuvasz, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The dense white coat of the Kuvasz can grow to six inches in length. Expect to brush your Kuvasz a couple of times a week to prevent mats from forming, using a grooming rake, slicker brush, or pin brush. If your Kuvasz gets matted, use a large-toothed comb and a conditioning spray, along with your fingers, to gently work the mat loose. Kuvaszok shed heavily in the spring and the fall, and need more frequent brushing during these times. Unless he"s sick or has been rolling in something smelly, the Kuvasz coat is odorless and repels dirt and water, so you won"t need to bathe him often. In fact, bathing him too frequently could strip his coat of its natural protective oils, causing him to get dirty faster. Many Kuvasz owners clean their dogs" coats by sprinkling talcum powder or cornstarch into the coat, and then brushing it out. Trim the fur that grows between his toes, and trim his toenails as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Start getting your Kuvasz used to brushing and handling when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and grooming sessions when he"s an adult.
Kuvaszok are fond of children, and can be gentle and protective with them. If your kids are playing with friends, though, it"s essential to supervise if a Kuvasz is nearby. He may mistake other children"s play for aggression and will move to protect "his" kids. Kuvaszok puppies can be too rambunctious for young children. As with any dog, always teach children how to safely approach and touch your Kuvasz, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or tail-pulling from either party.

Enjoying strong popularity in short order, this "designer" hybrid became well known quickly. Bred to be a hypoallergenic service dog, the Labradoodle went on to prove that she could also be a versatile family and therapy dog as well. A Labradoodle is happiest when she"s with the people she loves, and she"ll shower her family with affection and devotion. With the energy of the Labrador Retriever and the work ethic of both the Lab and the Poodle, she"s a joy. Thanks to the efforts of a handful of people, the Labradoodle may soon end up as one of the most popular breeds around. A Labradoodle approaches life head-on at breakneck speed, and she approaches every new friend with the same enthusiasm. With training, however, you can teach your Labradoodle proper doggy etiquette. A Labradoodle is generally easy to train, since she"s intelligent and eager to please. She usually does well with other dogs and pets in the household, and she is generally good with children--but she can be exuberant and may unintentionally injure a young child through sheer boisterousness. Overall, however, she makes an excellent pet for a first-time dog owner. She can be calm and quiet while curled up on your feet, but she"s also ready to jump up and play a game of fetch with only a moment"s notice. She"s not an ideal guard dog; although she will alert bark, she"s more likely to invite an intruder in for tea on the good china. While most aspects of Labradoodles are wonderful, many of the dogs are nowhere near what the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia intended, nor what the Association would consider using for a guide dog. The biggest problem with Labradoodles at this time is that there isn"t enough consistency in offspring, no matter whether Poodles are bred to Labs or Labradoodles are bred to Labradoodles. Among purebreds, there are certain characteristics that all of the dogs have in common, even accounting for individual personalities. (For example, you know that a Border Collie is going to herd something, anything.) But so far, even with multigenerational Labradoodles, that consistency is lacking. The hybrid"s popularity has unfortunately added to the problem, because it has encouraged some careless or unethical breeding, particularly from irresponsible breeders who are not familiar with sound breeding practices. Some Labradoodles are more like Poodles: smart, reserved, and quiet with a fine, high-maintenance coat that needs to be trimmed regularly. Poodles are excellent watchdogs, and some (but not all) Labradoodles are as well. Other Labradoodles are more like Labs: rowdy, slow to mature, and prone to shed as often as they breathe. The coat is where one of this hybrid"s greatest discrepancies turns up. The Labradoodle was meant to be nonshedding (like the Poodle), but it"s still common to have more than one coat type, as well as variation in puppy sizes, within one litter. Some people with allergies have had to give up their Labradoodles because of the shedding, which is what they were trying to avoid in the first place. Others end up taking care of a finely-textured Poodle coat, though they had bypassed a purebred Poodle to begin with because they didn"t want to have to consistently trim, comb, and take care of that fine coat, with its tendency to mat and tangle. If you"re allergic to dogs, you"ll still most likely be allergic to Labradoodles, or any of the Doodle mixes. Most people who have allergic reactions aren"t allergic to the coat so much as to the dander, the bits of skin that come off the dog with the shed hair. The less shedding, the less dander that you can react to; but it"s really an individual situation, particularly with the Labradoodle, where there"s a variety of coat types. If this is a foremost concern for you, make sure your breeder understands that so she can help pick out the puppy who is least likely to shed. Sadly, the hybrid"s rapid popularity has already caused Labradoodles to show up in puppy mills and among irresponsible breeders. Puppy mills tend to sell sickly puppies with iffy temperaments. Irresponsible breeders hopping on the designer-dog bandwagon usually don"t produce good puppies because they think breeding is just about simply finding two dogs of the same breed, when it"s far more complicated than that. Efforts have begun to curb this disturbing trend; several organizations now offer breeder referrals and are striving to promote multigenerational breeding. Just be aware that if you"re going to pay the high purchase price of a Labradoodle (which is typically more than you"d pay for either a Poodle or a Lab), you want to do some research to get the best-bred dog possible.
The Labradoodle results from Poodle to Labrador Retriever breedings. There has been some increase in multigenerational breeding (Labradoodle to Labradoodle), and also Labradoodle to Poodle or Labradoodle to Labrador Retriever breeding. Although the Labradoodle is not a recognized breed, the International Australian Labradoodle Association, along with the Australian Labradoodle Association and the Australian Labradoodle Association of America, are taking steps to create a breed standard and unite breeders. You can find a responsible Labradoodle breeder, or links to one, by visiting the Australian Labradoodle Association of America website. Labradoodles are playful and very loving with children, but they can be overexuberant and may knock down younger children unintentionally. The Labradoodle has three different coat types; depending on which coat yours has, you can expect her to be a non- to average shedder. Usually the Labradoodle doesn"t shed excessively, but the Hair coat type is the exception to this rule. A Labradoodle needs one or two brushings per week, as well as regular grooming that includes ear cleaning and nail clipping. The Labradoodle can be a high-energy dog. She requires about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day. Labradoodles are intelligent and need to be mentally and physically stimulated. If they aren"t, they can become destructive and hard to handle. Labradoodles do well with other dogs and pets. Apartments are not the ideal setting for this energetic dog. First-time owners do well with the friendly and amenable Labradoodle. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Labradoodle was originally developed in Australia to be a hypoallergenic guide dog. In 1989, Wally Conron, who was in charge of the breeding program for the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia, conducted the first purposeful crossbreeding between a Standard Poodle and Labrador Retriever . This first cross of Conron"s produced a dog called Sultan, who not only had the hypoallergenic coat but also had the aptitude, intelligence, and personality to be an effective guide dog. Sultan went on to work with a woman in Hawaii and was a successful at his work. At that point, other breeders saw the merit of crossing these two breeds. Like the Labrador Retriever parent, the Labradoodle quickly rose in popularity and has become one of the most sought-after "Doodle breeds." These dogs are often produced by crossing a Labrador Retriever with a Poodle, but multigenerational breeding has begun in an attempt to produce a viable and recognizable breed. Both the Australian Labradoodle Association and the International Australian Labradoodle Association are taking steps in this direction (there are no Labradoodle breed clubs in North America), and they hope to move this designer breed into registered breed status in the next few years. These groups have made great efforts to bring breeders together so that they"re working to achieve the same standards through multigenerational breeding.
The Labradoodle comes in three size variations, depending on the size of the Poodle used for the first-generation breeding. The three sizes are Standard, Medium, and Miniature. The Standard Labradoodle should be 22 to 24 inches in height for a male and 21 to 23 inches in height for a female, while both can range in weight from 50 to 65 pounds. The Medium Labradoodle should be 18 to 20 inches high for a male and 17 to 19 inches high for a female, with both weighing from 30 to 45 pounds. The average size for a Miniature Labradoodle is between 14 to 16 inches and 15 to 25 pounds.
The Labradoodle is an intelligent dog who can make the ideal family pet if properly trained. She is friendly and accepts and treats everyone like her best friend. She is devoted to her family and enjoys life as an energetic companion. She can be gentle, but she can also be joyful, showing her happiness through exuberant jumping and playing. She also tends to be easygoing, since the Labradoodle was bred not to be aggressive. As is the case with any breed, some poorly bred ones aren"t all that friendly, but a well-bred Labradoodle with a characteristic temperament is a true joy. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents--usually the mother is the one who"s available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when she grows up. Like every dog, the Labradoodle needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Labradoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling her in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking her to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help her polish his social skills.
Labradoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labradoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Labradoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Ear Infections: These can plague Labradoodles because of their floppy ears. The ears trap moisture and should be regularly checked. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Labradoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate for the fact that glucose (sugar) isn"t getting into her cells to burn for energy, because of improper levels of insulin in her body. But she"ll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.
Labradoodles can adapt to just about any setting, but they"re not recommended for apartments. They require about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day and would do better with a fenced yard in which to expel some energy. Some Labradoodles, especially in the first generation, can require even more exercise. The Labradoodle makes an excellent jogging companion but also needs some time off-leash to burn off steam. In addition, she needs to be intellectually stimulated; she"s smart and energetic, so if she becomes bored, she can become a destruction machine. The Labradoodle is an intelligent and eager-to-please dog. Training should be easy as long as consistency and positive reinforcement are the methods. She can make a good companion for first-time dog owners since she doesn"t need an overly firm hand. Socialize her from puppyhood, since she tends to hurl herself headlong into canine situations without regard to the feelings of other dogs. This can lead to some problems if the unknown dog is aggressive. Despite her activity levels, a Labradoodle can adjust to living in suburban or city environments and can do well in rural settings. Although she is used for various working roles, she"s a companion dog through and through, and she should live inside the house, not out in the yard. She"s happiest living in the comforts of home, sleeping soundly on your feet or in a bed next to yours. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Labradoodle doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things she shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where she can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Labradoodle accept confinement if she ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Labradoodle in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and she shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when she"s sleeping at night. Labradoodles are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Labradoodle in good shape by measuring her food and feeding her twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether she"s overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, she needs less food and more exercise. Dividing your Labradoodle"s food into two or more meals per day instead of a big bowl once a day can also lower her risk of gastric torsion, also known as bloat. The Labrador Retriever can suffer from this condition, and it"s a trait that can be easily passed on to any Labradoodle offspring. For more on feeding your Labradoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Although a Labradoodle can have one of a range of coat types, the desired length is 4 to 6 inches. She has a single coat with hair ranging from straight to loose curls. The curls shouldn"t be tight and the coat shouldn"t be thick or fluffy. There are three types of texture: The Hair coat, which is similar to fur in shedding breeds, is the least popular. Hair coats shed and usually have a normal doggy odor. This coat is seen in first generations, although breeders try to avoid it. The second texture, called a Wool coat, is dense and similar in feel to a lamb"s wool, hence its descriptive name. Wool coats hang in loose curls and aren"t dense. Generally, the Wool coat doesn"t have a "doggy" odor and it"s usually nonshedding. The Fleece coat has a silky texture often described as an Angora goat texture. This coat ranges from straight to wavy. Labradoodles are considered to be non- to low shedders, especially those with a Fleece or Wool coat. Hair coats tend to shed just as they do in other breeds, ranging from very low to average shedding. The Labradoodle comes in a wide variety of colors. These can be gold, apricot, caramel, chalk (a chalky white), black, red, café, cream, silver, chocolate, parchment, and blue. They can also have parti-colored coats, which consist of brindles, phantom, patched, or sable colors. Grooming requirements vary depending on the length and type of coat the dog has. Generally speaking, you can expect to brush a Labradoodle about once or twice per week. Some can be clipped or trimmed every six to eight weeks to keep the coat easy to maintain. A Labradoodle should only be bathed when necessary--which isn"t often, as many of the coats don"t have a noticeable doggy odor. Like Labs, Labradoodles can be prone to ear infections, so take a little extra time caring for their ears. Dry and clean them after a swim, and check them once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Labradoodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding--and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Begin accustoming your Labradoodle to being brushed and examined when she"s a puppy. Handle her paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside her mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Labradoodle does well with children and can be an affectionate and gentle companion for any child. She can also be exuberant and might knock down smaller children, but she will love them with all her heart. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Labradoodles usually get along well with other dogs and pets. Like most dogs, they need training and socialization for optimum success at living with and visiting other animals.

The warm and intelligent Lab is America"s number one breed registered with the American Kennel Club. Even non-dog people can recognize a Lab, and artists and photographers have captured his image countless times — usually as the loyal companion, waiting patiently by his owner"s side.Built for sport, the Lab is muscular and athletic. He has a short, easy-care coat, friendly demeanor, keen intelligence, and plenty of energy. Devotion to this breed runs deep; Labs are loving, people-oriented dogs who live to serve their families, and owners and fans sometimes liken their Labs to angels.The breed originated on the island of Newfoundland, off the northeastern Atlantic coast of Canada. Originally called the St. John"s dog, after the capital city of Newfoundland, he was bred to help the local fishermen — hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish that had escaped the nets — as well as to be a family dog.Today, most Labs skip the hard labor and spend their days being pampered and loved by their people. However, some Labs still serve as indispensable working dogs.The Lab"s sweet nature makes him an excellent therapy dog, visiting homes for the elderly and hospitals, and his intelligence makes him an ideal assistance dog for the handicapped. He also excels as a search and rescue dog or as a retriever for hunters, thanks to his athletic build, strong nose, and courageous nature. And Labs have also become the breed to beat at dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions — especially obedience.There"s one dog job that Labs are hopeless at: watchdog. In fact, owners say their sweet, helpful Lab is likely to greet an intruder and happily show him where the goods are stashed.Labrador Retrievers have proven their usefulness and versatility throughout the breed"s history, easily shifting from fisherman"s companion, to field retriever, to show dog, to modern working dog. One role has remained constant: wonderful companion and friend.
Labrador Retrievers love, love, love to eat, and become obese very quickly if overfed. Limit treats, give your Lab plenty of exercise, and measure out regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. And be warned that the Lab"s large appetite extends to people food and even inedible items. Labradors will forage in garbage, counter surf, and can make a meal out of chewed-up items like children"s toys. Labrador Retrievers were bred for physically demanding jobs, and they have the high energy that goes along with being a working breed. They need at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Without it, they can vent their pent-up energy in destructive ways, such as barking and chewing. Labs have such a good reputation that many people think they don"t need to bother with training. But Labs are large, energetic animals, and like all dogs, they need to be taught good canine manners. Sign up for puppy and obedience classes as soon as you bring your Lab home. Many people think of Labs as a hyperactive breed. Lab puppies are definitely lively, but most will slow down a bit as they grow up. However, they usually remain fairly active throughout their lives. Labrador Retrievers are not known to be escape artists, but with the right motivation — such as a whiff of something yummy — a Lab will take off. Make sure your Lab has current identification tags and a microchip. The Lab is America"s number one dog, which means there are plenty of people breeding Labs who are more interested in filling the demand for Lab puppies than in breeding healthy dogs with good temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments. If you"re looking for a puppy, you"ll find that Labs vary depending on what breeder you choose. Some Labs are bred for competitions testing their skill as working dogs, and others are bred to get as close as possible to the ideal look, movement, and temperament of the breed. You"ll also find breeders who aim for both looks and utility. Labs bred for the show ring tend to be slightly heavier and more solidly built than those intended for canine careers.
Labrador Retrievers hail from the island of Newfoundland, off the northeastern Atlantic coast of Canada. Originally called St. John"s dogs, after the capital city of Newfoundland, Labs served as companions and helpers to the local fishermen beginning in the 1700s.The dogs spent their days working alongside their owners, retrieving fish who had escaped hooks and towing in lines, and then returned home to spend the evening with the fishermen"s family.Although his heritage is unknown, many believe the St. John"s dog was interbred with the Newfoundland Dog and other small local water dogs.Outsiders noticed the dog"s usefulness and good disposition, and English sportsmen imported a few Labs to England to serve as retrievers for hunting. The second Earl of Malmesbury was one of the first, and had St. John"s dogs shipped to England sometime around 1830. The third Earl of Malmesbury was the first person to refer to the dogs as Labradors.Amazingly, Labs — now America"s most popular dog — were almost extinct by the 1880s, and the Malmesbury family and other English fans are credited with saving the breed. In Newfoundland, the breed disappeared because of government restrictions and tax laws. Families were allowed to keep no more than one dog, and owning a female was highly taxed, so girl puppies were culled from litters.In England, however, the breed survived, and the Kennel Club recognized the Labrador Retriever as a distinct breed in 1903. The American Kennel Club followed suit in 1917, and in the "20s and "30s, British Labs were imported to establish the breed in the U.S.The breed"s popularity really began to take off after World War II, and in 1991, the Labrador Retriever became the most popular dog registered with the American Kennel Club — and he"s held that distinction ever since. He also tops the list in Canada and England.Today, Labs work in drug and explosive detection, search and rescue, therapy, assistance to the handicapped, and as retrievers for hunters. They also excel in all forms of dog competitions: show, field, agility, and obedience.
Males stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches, and weigh 65 to 80 pounds. Females stand 21.5 to 23.5 inches, and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.
The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and it"s well deserved. He"s outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals.Aside from a winning personality, he has the intelligence and eagerness to please that make him easy to train. Training is definitely necessary because this breed has a lot of energy and exuberance. The working heritage of the Lab means he is active. This breed needs activity, both physical and mental, to keep him happy. There is some variation in the activity level of Labs: some are rowdy, others are more laid back. All thrive on activity.
Labrador Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision, as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Epilepsy: Labs can suffer from epilepsy, which causes mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Lab has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup.Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia (TVD): TVD is a congenital heart defect that has been increasing in prevalence in the Labrador breed. Puppies are born with TVD, which is a malformation of the tricuspid valve on the right side of the heart. It can be mild or severe; some dogs live with no symptoms, others die. TVD is detected by ultrasound. Research is ongoing to learn how widespread it is in the breed, as well as treatment.Myopathy: Myopathy affects the muscles and nervous system. The first signs are seen early, as young as six weeks and often by seven months of age. A puppy with myopathy is tired, stiff when he walks and trots. He may collapse after exercise. In time, the muscles atrophy and the dog can barely stand or walk. There is no treatment, but rest and keeping the dog warm seems to reduce symptoms. Dogs with myopathy should not be bred because it is considered a heritable disease.Gastric Dilataion-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Labs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Acute Moist Dermatitis: Acute moist dermatitis is a skin condition in which the skin red and inflamed. It is caused by a bacterial infection. The more common name of this health concern is hot spots. Treatment includes clipping the hair, bathing in medicated shampoo, and antibiotics.Cold Tail: Cold tail is a benign, though painful condition common to Labs and other retrievers. Also caused limber tail, it caused the dog"s tail to go limp. The dog may bite at the tail. It isn"t cause for alarm, and usually goes away on its own in a few days. It is thought to be a problem with the muscles between the vertebrae in the tail.Ear Infections: The Lab"s love of water, combined with his drop ear make him prone to ear infections. Weekly checking and cleaning if necessary helps prevent infection.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Labs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The lovable Lab needs to be around his family, and is definitely not a backyard dog. If he"s left alone for too long, he"ll probably tarnish his saintly reputation: A lonely, bored Lab is apt to dig, chew, or find other destructive outlets for his energy.Labs show some variation in their activity levels, but all of them need activity, both physical and mental. Daily 30-minute walks, a romp at the dog park, or a game of fetch, are a few ways to help your Lab burn off energy. However, a puppy should not be taken for too long walks and should play for a few minutes at a time. Labrador Retrievers are considered "workaholics," and will exhaust themselves. It is up to you to end play and training sessions.Labs have such good reputations that some owners think they don"t need training. That"s a big mistake. Without training, a rambunctious Lab puppy will soon grow to be a very large, rowdy dog. Luckily, Labs take to training well — in fact, they often excel in obedience competitions.Start with puppy kindergarten, which not only teaches your pup good canine manners, but helps him learn how to be comfortable around other dogs and people. Look for a class that uses positive training methods that reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong.You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Lab puppy. Don"t let your Lab puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility, with its one-inch jumps.Like all retrievers, the Lab is mouthy, and he"s happiest when he has something, anything, to carry in his mouth. He"s also a chewer, so be sure to keep sturdy toys available all the time — unless you want your couch chewed up. And when you leave the house, it"s wise to keep your Lab in a crate or kennel so he"s can"t get himself into trouble chewing things he shouldn"t.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Lab in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Lab puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Feed your puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.For more on feeding your Lab, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The sleek and easy-care Lab coat has two layers: a short, thick, straight topcoat, and a soft, weather-resistant undercoat. The two-layer coat protects him from the cold and wet, which helps him in his role as a retriever for hunters.The coat comes in three colors: chocolate, black, and yellow. Black was the favorite color among early breeders, but over the years, yellow and chocolate Labs have become popular. Some breeders have recently begun selling "rare" colored Labrador Retrievers, such as polar white or fox red. These shades aren"t really rare — they"re a variation of the yellow Lab.Grooming doesn"t get much easier than with a Lab, but the breed does shed — a lot. Buy a quality vacuum cleaner and brush your dog daily, especially when he"s shedding, to get out the loose hair.Labs need a bath about every two months or so to keep them looking clean and smelling good. Of course, if your Lab rolls in a mud puddle or something foul, which he"s apt to do, it"s fine to bathe him more often.Brush your Lab"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Lab enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Because ear infections are common in Labs, also clean out the ears after bathing, swimming, or any time your dog gets wet. This helps prevent infection.Begin accustoming your Lab to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Labrador Retriever not only loves kids, he enjoys the commotion they bring with them. He"ll happily attend a child"s birthday party, and even willingly wear a party hat. Like all dogs, however, he needs to be trained how to act around kids — and kids need to be taught how to act around the dog.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If a Lab has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals, and has been trained how to interact with them, he"ll be friendly with other pets, too.

Created to be a practical working terrier, the Lakeland hails from England"s beautiful but rugged and mountainous Lake District, where his job was to hunt and kill the foxes that plagued farmers. He"s small, square, and sturdy, with a deep, relatively narrow body that allows him to squeeze into rocky dens after his prey. Lakies, as these lively, feisty little dogs are nicknamed, are affectionate, friendly, and self-confident. They"re characterized by a rectangular head, an intense and sometimes impish expression, v-shaped ears that fold over, and a docked tail carried up. They have a double coat: a thick, hard topcoat to protect them from thorns and a dense undercoat to keep them warm in the hail, sleet, snow, and rain of their home region. Alert and ready to go, Lakies often look as if they"re standing on their tiptoes. The Lakeland is cheerful and energetic, but like any self-respecting terrier, he can be willful and determined. Nonetheless, his people are enchanted by his charm, intelligence, and sense of humor. Lakies have a lot of courage and confidence. They generally get along well with children and other dogs, but are reserved with strangers. Being terriers, they are prone to chasing small animals, so it"s advisable to socialize them with cats and other small animals from an early age. Like many terriers, Lakelands can be difficult to housetrain, and they have their own thoughts about what constitutes proper behavior, which may not be the same as yours. Also, some like to dig, bark quite a lot, and guard their toys and food. Therefore, they need to have firm, patient training from an early age. They are intelligent dogs, so be sure that your training has lots of variety to keep them challenged. Also, you must be fair in your training techniques. All terriers have a sense of fairness and are willing to be corrected when it is merited. But if the correction is harsh or undeserved, they are likely to growl and rebel. Using proper training techniques, you"ll find that your Lakeland is quick to learn. Because he has a great deal of energy, you might want to consider training him for obedience or agility. Lakies are small dogs, so it would seem that they would be good for apartment dwellers. Unfortunately, their propensity for barking might rule that out, unless you put in the time to train them to be quiet. Grooming is moderately time-consuming. They need to be brushed two or three times a week and "stripped" periodically to keep their coats in proper condition. Although they have many fine qualities, Lakelands are uncommon and aren"t readily available. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list, as much as six months to a year, if you want one of these charming terriers.
Never purchase a Lakeland from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents with a nice temperament. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they"re happy with their Lakeland. Doing your homework may save you from a lot of heartbreak later. Lakeland Terriers are excitable dogs and have a lot of energy. They are a highly intelligent breed that can take advantage of an insecure owner and become the "ruler of the house." Be sure that your Lakie knows who is alpha in your household (hopefully, you!). Lakeland Terriers are prone to chasing other animals or anything else that might interest them. Keep them on a leash when you"re in unfenced areas. Speaking of fences, it"s best that you have a fenced yard for your Lakies to play in. Just be sure that the fence is very secure. They can be escape artists! Barking sometimes is a problem with Lakeland Terriers. Lakeland Terriers can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. Lakeland Terriers tend to be possessive about their food and toys. Obedience training is recommended. Their terrier aggression can get out of hand without proper respect for their owners and training.
The Lakeland Terrier was born in the county of Cumberland in England"s beautiful but treacherously rugged Lake District near the Scottish border. The Lake District is known for its beautiful hills and mountains. Beatrix Potter had a farm here, where she, like many of the farmers in this region, raised a rare hardy breed of sheep called Herdwicks. The terrain is harsh and rugged, and sheep farms dotted the scenic countryside. A large, aggressive type of fox called a Westmoreland fox preys on the sheep, especially during the lambing season, which happens to coincide with the time that the foxes are weaning their cubs. The Lakeland"s job was to "go to ground" when the fox ran into its burrow and kill it. Some of the game little terriers also were owned by miners and other workers who used them for sport, such as badger digging, rabbiting, ratting, and fox hunting. Eventually, "meets" were held where people could show off their dogs. The Lakelands first were classified as colored working terriers to differentiate them from white terriers (even though sometimes both were out of the same litter). Lakelands are related to several terrier breeds, including the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Dandie Dinmont and Bedlington Terriers, and the Border Terrier. They are one of the oldest working terrier breeds still in use today. In 1921 the Lakeland Terrier Association was formed in England. They were first exhibited in England under a variety of names, including the Fell and Patterdale Terrier. The American Kennel Club first registered a Lakeland Terrier, Eaton What A Lad Of Howtown, in 1934, by which time it had its current name and was a regular in the show rings both in the U.S. and England. Breeders worked to produce dogs that would have the looks to win in the show ring while retaining the working characteristics that were so prized. They appear to have succeeded in grand style. Lakelands have won most of the major shows and awards that can be found around the world. The first great champion Lakeland Terrier was named Rogerholme Recruit, who won Best in Show at the prestigious 1963 Crufts dog show England. Just three years later, in 1967, another English Lakeland Terrier named Stingray of Derryabahwon Best in Show at the 1967 Crufts and Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in 1968. In the early seventies, Ch Special Edition won dozens of Bests in Show, and another Lakie named Ch Jo-Ni"s Red Baron of Crofton won 73 Bests in Show, with the last being awarded at the 1976 at Westminster"s Centennial dog show. Several other Lakeland Terriers also have proven the appeal of the breed in the show ring by winning multiple Bests in Show, Groups, and other awards. In the early 1990s, an outstanding Lakie named Ch. Revelry"s Awesome Blossom, owned by Jean L. Heath and comedian Bill Cosby, emerged. Her remarkable show record included more than 100 All-Breed Bests-in-Show, making her among the top-winning show dogs of all time.
The compact and athletic Lakeland Terrier is typically 13 1/2 to 14 1/2 inches tall, and weighs 15 to 17 pounds.
The typical Lakeland is bold and friendly. He"s described as having a "cock of the walk" attitude, but he"s neither overly aggressive or argumentative. All terrier, he"s curious about everything, intelligent, and entertaining. He"s usually reserved with strangers but loves his family, especially the kids. With other dogs, he might not start a fight, but he certainly won"t back down from one. Alert and self-confident, he makes an excellent watchdog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Lakelands need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Lakeland puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Lakeland Terriers are a hardy breed and don"t suffer from any known hereditary health problems. To help ensure that you get a healthy Lakeland puppy, choose a breeder who abides by the U. S. Lakeland Terrier Club code of ethics.
The Lakeland should live in the home with his people, not outdoors. Because of his small size, the Lakeland Terrier is good for apartment life so long as you train him not to bark at every noise he hears. He"s active indoors and will do all right without a yard so long as you provide him with one or two daily walks of 20 to 30 minutes. If he has a yard, it should be securely fenced as he"s a capable digger and escape artist. Don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep him confined; the threat of a shock is nothing to a tough terrier who wants to go after something. Ideally, he should be able run and play off leash regularly in a safe area. Keep the Lakie on leash when you walk him. You never know when his terrier instinct to hunt will kick in. With his independent nature, the Lakie can be a challenge to train. Keep your sense of humor at the ready, as well as a large supply of patience. Be firm and consistent, but use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play to get the most out of him. Keep lessons short, sweet, and entertaining, and you"ll find that your Lakeland is quite intelligent and capable of learning whatever you can teach. Housetraining can sometimes be a problem with this breed. Patience and consistency are musts. Take him out to potty first thing in the morning, after every meal, after naps and playtime, and just before bedtime. Reward him every time he potties outdoors. Crate training helps as well. Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Lakeland doesn"t get into things he shouldn"t. Like every dog, Lakies can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Lakeland accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Lakeland in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Lakies are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Lakeland excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Keep this in mind if he"ll be living in an apartment or condo community.
Recommended daily amount: 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your adult Lakeland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Lakeland, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog."
Lakeland Terriers have a thick, hard topcoat and a soft undercoat. When he"s hand stripped to show his outline, he has a neat, workmanlike appearance. In the show ring, the coat on the head, ears, forechest, shoulders, and behind the tail is trimmed short and smooth. The coat on the body is about half an inch to an inch long and can be straight or slightly wavy. The long hair on the legs, known as furnishings, gives the legs a cylindrical appearance. The hair on the face is trimmed but left longer over the eyes to enhance the head"s rectangular appearance. Lakies come in many colors, including blue, black, liver (a deep reddish-brown), red, and wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a tan saddle that covers the back of the neck, back, sides, and up the tail, making them blue and tan, black and tan, or liver and tan. They can also be what"s called red grizzle or grizzle and tan. A red grizzle Lakeland has a saddle that"s a deep, rich red over a tan base. Grizzle is a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs. Puppies often are born dark. Lakelands don"t shed much, especially if their coat is kept stripped. Stripping is a technique that involves plucking the dead hair by hand or removing it with a stripping knife or other stripping tool. Your Lakeland"s breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it (not all do). For easier care, you can clipper the coat, but the texture and color will become softer and lighter. That doesn"t affect the Lakeland"s ability to be a great companion, though. Spend 15 to 30 minutes a week to brush and comb your Lakie. Then give him a rubdown with a towel to remove any dirt and excess body oils. If you do this regularly, you shouldn"t need to bathe him often unless he"s rolled in something stinky. Remove loose hair from inside the ears and trim excess hair between the pads of the feet. Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Lakeland"s nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Lakie to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Lakies love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but certain rules apply to child-dog interactions. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Lakelands can get along well with other pets, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. They shouldn"t be aggressive toward strange dogs, but they won"t back down from them either. They may chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they probably shouldn"t be trusted alone with pocket pets such as hamsters and gerbils.
Lakeland Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption or fostering. Abandoned Terrier Rescue Association United States Lakeland Terrier Club Lakeland Terrier Rescue

In his past, the Lancashire Heeler was used to drive livestock to market. He was short enough to nip at their heels to move them along and agile enough to leap out of the way if they tried to kick. When he wasn"t on the road to the market, he helped out on the farm by catching rats and rabbits. He resembles his cousins the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis but has a black-and-tan coloration that may be a sign of Manchester Terrier heritage. In his homeland of Great Britain, he"s a popular companion, show dog, and agility and obedience competitor. He also competes at herding trials. This is an intelligent dog who learns quickly, but he has a mind of his own and can be stubborn as well as mischievously inventive. Train him with kind but firm consistency and positive reinforcement. With other people he"s generally friendly but he can be sharp toward other dogs. Early socialization with people and other dogs is important. He"s best suited to families with school-age children and enjoys having a yard where he can run. Be sure it"s escapeproof!

Originally from Germany, where he was created through crosses between Newfoundlands, longhaired Saint Bernards, plus some Great Pyrenees, this giant breed requires a commitment to training and a high tolerance for mischief and mess. He looks beautiful in the show ring, but his natural state is more along the lines of damp and muddy than leonine elegance. That, along with long fur and copious shedding, makes this a poor choice for neatniks. Early and extensive socialization and training with plenty of positive reinforcement and consistent expectations will turn him into a family friend like no other, but without them he"s mischievous and destructive. The Leo"s high energy levels and intelligence make him a super competitor in agility and obedience trials, and he"s also found doing therapy visits and water rescue work. Leos like living in a pride of their own kind, but they get along well with other animals, too, including cats and horses. Because of their great size, they should never be left alone with young children. This is a sensitive dog who dislikes family arguments. Keep your disagreements private or he may try to intervene. The Leo loves being with his people and won"t be happy to spend all his time alone in the backyard. Expect to give him about an hour of exercise daily.Take the Leo"s size into consideration before bringing one home; this breed needs a family with a yard and an SUV, not a studio apartment and a Miata. The coat sheds heavily twice a year and moderately the rest of the time. On the plus side, his deep bark and huge size are more than enough to put off any halfway intelligent intruder.

The Lhasa Apso thinks he"s a large dog, a very large dog. Bred for hundreds of years to be a royal watchdog, the modern Lhasa approaches life the way his forebears did: he is a loyal guardian of home and family. The Lhasa"s protective nature can surprise those unfamiliar with him, given his small size and long, flowing coat. He certainly doesn"t appear fierce. But when it comes to protecting his own, the Lhasa is fierce, though never unusually aggressive. He"s naturally suspicious of strangers — an excellent trait for a palace guard — and he takes his job as protector seriously. The lionhearted Lhasa"s devotion also means he enjoys sharing life with his family. He"s intelligent, independent (a watchdog must think on his own), and mischievous. If you are considering a Lhasa — and many find his looks irresistible — you must consider this breed"s protective nature. Early socialization and training are absolutely critical to a Lhasa"s success as a family member, so that he can properly direct his natural tendency toward wariness. The time invested in training him, however, is well worth your effort in terms of the loyalty, joy, and companionship that this long-lived, hardy little dog provides. The Lhasa likes doing his own thing, which means his goal in life is not necessarily to please you. In this he differs from such breeds as the biddable Labrador Retriever. While the Lhasa can be trained successfully, he is not always the most obedient dog in the class. But those who know and love the Lhasa praise his smarts and unique ability to reason. He can even tend toward manipulation, so consistency is key in training the Lhasa pup (just as it is with raising children). If you don"t take charge, your Lhasa will certainly try. Few pups are cuter than the Lhasa puppy, with his sparking eyes and fluffy coat. These little ones are curious and full of energy, and they love to play. The Lhasa matures slowly and remains puppyish until he"s three years old. New owners need to keep this in mind when training Lhasa puppies, or they can become frustrated with the Lhasa"s refusal to take lessons too seriously. Housetraining can be difficult; crate training is recommended. Now, about that Lhasa coat — it"s splendid: long, thick, and beautiful. It"s also a chore to keep in good condition. Daily brushing and combing are necessary to keep it free of tangles. Frequent bathing is necessary, too, to keep the Lhasa smelling sweet. Some owners opt to trim the coat short, or trim the hair around the face. If you are considering a Lhasa, know that you"ll be doing a lot of grooming, or that you"ll be on a first-name basis with a professional groomer. What about children and the Lhasa? Be aware that the breed is known for being impatient with the normal clumsiness associated with children; he"ll nip. He tends to bond with adults more than with youngsters, but this isn"t a hard-and-fast rule. Older children, or young children who are exceptionally gentle with dogs, can live happily with the Lhasa. If you are seeking a 100 percent "kid dog," the Lhasa is probably not a good choice. The average Lhasa lives a long time: 12 to 15 years is not uncommon, and some live 17 to 20 years.
The Lhasa is highly independent; his aim is to please himself, not you. The Lhasa is a leader, and he"ll be your leader if you allow him to. The Lhasa is a naturally protective watchdog. There"s no changing this, though you can teach him good canine manners. Early, positive socialization is essential to help him become a friendly, sociable pet. The Lhasa matures slowly. Don"t expect too much too soon. The beautiful Lhasa coat needs a lot of grooming. Expect to do a lot of work, or to pay a professonial groomer. Dental care is essential. Brush the Lhasa"s teeth regularly, and have your veterinarian check his teeth and gums periodically. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Lhasa comes from Tibet, and he takes his name from the holy city of Lhasa. For thousands of years, the Lhasa was bred exclusively by nobility and monks in monasteries to act an inside guard and protector. He"s known in his homeland as Abso Seng Kye, which translates as "Bark Lion Sentinel Dog." The Lhasa"s thick coat is protective; his native climate is one of intense cold and extreme heat. Recorded history of the breed goes back to 800 B.C. A Lhasa was considered good luck, but it was nearly impossible to buy one: he was a watchdog in temples and monasteries and was therefore considered sacred. It was thought that when an owner died, the human soul entered the body of his Lhasa Apso. Lhasas were not allowed to leave the country except when given as gifts by the Dalai Lama. From the beginning of the Manchu Dynasty in 1583 until as recently as 1908, the Dalai Lama sent Lhasas as sacred gifts to the Emperor of China and members of the Imperial family. The Lhasas were always given in pairs and were thought to bring with them good luck and prosperity. The first Lhasas to enter the United States directly were given as gifts by the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933 to C. Suydam Cutting, a noted world traveler and naturalist. Cutting owned Hamilton Farm in Gladstone, New Jersey, and the two gift dogs became the foundation stock for his kennel. The American Kennel Club accepted the Lhasa Apso as a breed in 1935.
Males stand 10 to 11 inches high and weigh 13 to 15 pounds; females are slightly smaller.
The Lhasa Apso personality is a special and interesting mix. He"s a happy, mischievous, and playful dog; he"s also regal, independent, and fierce. He takes the job of guarding his home and family seriously; he also takes a long time to grow up, and even then he remains somewhat puppyish until old age. The Lhasa may be small, but he isn"t a bit fragile. He"s sturdy and strong, and he"s naturally wary of strangers. He will make friends, but not until he knows that an individual poses no threat. He"s an excellent watchdog. The independent Lhasa likes to be "top dog." Training and socialization, beginning with puppy classes, are essential. They"ll teach him good canine manners and prevent him from thinking he can rule the roost. Lhasa owners must be strong, kind leaders. The Lhasa is not extremely active and is content living indoors. Unlike many other breeds, he doesn"t need vigorous exercise to reduce nervous energy. However, he does enjoy and benefit from short walks and play sessions. The Lhasa likes to stay close to his family, following them room to room to join in the activities or sit on a lap. However, because of his independent nature, he"s fine when left alone at home for reasonable amounts of time. The Lhasa doesn"t usually suffer from separation anxiety. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
Lhasas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Lhasas will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Lhasas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cherry Eye: This malady occurs when the gland known as the third eyelid swells. It looks like a red mass — a cherry — at the inner corner of the dog"s eye. The treatment for cherry eye is usually surgery. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Lhasa Apso is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): This is a serious problem in dogs. This genetic skin condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and they"re eventually destroyed. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin, an unpleasant odor, and secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Commonly known as dry eye, this is an inflammation of the eye that occurs when the tear production is deficient. The symptoms, a gooey yellow discharge, can be mistaken for conjunctivitis. Treatment includes medication, artificial tears, and sometimes surgery. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Familial Inherited Renal Dysplasia: This is a developmental or genetic defect of the kidneys, which are noticeably small and irregular in shape. The disease varies in severity: severely affected puppies are excessively thirsty and small for their age, and they often suffer renal failure. Mildly affected dogs may show no symptoms.
The Lhasa is a great choice for people with limited space. He"s well suited for apartment or condo living, though he does enjoy playing outside in a fenced yard. The Lhasa is content with several short walks each day. He is not high-energy dog, and he doesn"t tend to bounce off the walls when cooped up on a rainy day. He"s happy sitting in your lap, wandering around the house, playing with his toys, and alerting you to passersby. Housetraining the Lhasa can be challenging, so it"s wise to crate train. Also, remember that this dog will likely take a long time to mature mentally. He may reach full size at one year of age, but his behavior will still be quite puppyish. Be especially patient during training — keep it positive and consistent, and be willing to go the long haul.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Lhasa in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Lhasa, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Lhasa coat is gorgeous. Normally it is long, straight, and dense. It comes in many colors, including honey, black, white, slate, or parti-color. Keeping the Lhasa coat gorgeous, however, is time-consuming and difficult. Regular, even daily, brushing and combing are necessary, as is frequent bathing (every two to four weeks). Many owners elect to hire a professional groomer, because although a hardworking owner can learn to manage the Lhasa"s coat, it"s certainly not a job for beginners. In fact, it"s not uncommon for owners to have their Lhasa"s coat clipped short to cut down on grooming chores. The beautiful flowing coat is gone, but what"s left is a lot easier to care for. Brush your Lhasa"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Lhasa to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Children are probably not at the top of the Lhasa"s list of favorite things. He tends to be intolerant of the normal antics of children, and he"ll nip. The Lhasa is best suited to a home with older children who understand how to properly handle him. He"s not advised for a family with young or rowdy kids. If he"s properly socialized and trained, the Lhasa gets along with other dogs. He does like to be top dog, so he"s often the leader, even around other dogs who are much larger. He isn"t afraid to join in activities normally associated with large dogs, such as hiking or cross-country skiing. The Lhasa thinks he"s a large dog. The Lhasa can get along with other pets as well, given proper introductions and training.
Lhasa Apsos are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Lhasa Apsos in need of adoption and/or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club, and they can point you toward a Lhasa Apso rescue organization. American Lhasa Apso Club

With a name that translates to "lion dog," you might expect the Lowchen to have a fierce demeanor, but with people he"s lionlike only in his looks. Playful and gentle, the Lowchen is a great companion for children and adults alike. He is surprisingly robust and loves to roughhouse with his people. The Lowchen generally gets along well with everyone, but he can be shy of strangers. With proper socialization, this trait can be overcome, however. Generally, Lowchen will fit into any household whether there are dogs before they arrive or not. They also get along well with other pets. The Lowchen is affectionate and loving. They thrive when they are with their people and can fit wherever that person is living, be it an apartment or a large estate. They should not be left outside or in a kennel, and doing so will not only lead to ill health for the dog but also to many temperamental problems. Lowchens are not known for their high activity levels, but they enjoy their role as watch dog and will bark an alert whenever they see something they think merits a response. Some can also be partial to digging, and this habit can be difficult to break. The name "lion dog" comes from the traditional Lowchen clip, with close-cut hindquarters and a full, natural mane, but the nickname applies to the little dog"s big personality as well. Lowchen have the "small dog...big personality" down pat, and that can be a joy and a frustration. They are lively and energetic, sweet and affectionate, and they will challenge any dog or rule if they decide to. They will take over the homes and lives of the people they love, and with their fierce determination and wonderful even temperament they will take over their owners" hearts as well.
The Lowchen was not developed to be an outdoor or kennel dog. They are companion dogs and are happiest when they are in the company of the people they love. Barking is a much-enjoyed pastime for the Lowchen. They make excellent watchdogs with their alarm barking but they may become a nuisance to neighbors. Lowchen make wonderful apartment residents as long as their exercise requirements are met. Expect to spend at least 20 minutes per day exercising him. He makes an excellent walking companion and will go for long walks with his people. Although the Lowchen doesn"t shed much, he still requires regular brushing and grooming to prevent tangles and mats and keep him in good health. Although not all Lowchen exhibit this trait, many enjoy digging and the habit may be difficult to discourage. Lowchen can be shy of new people, and it is important to socialize them at a young age to discourage any fearfulness or timid behaviors. Lowchens are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety whenever their companions leave for the day. They are not the best breed for people who work long hours. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
There are several theories as to the origins of the Lowchen, and the debate is often steeped in controversy. One theory has the breed originating in Northern Europe, which includes Germany, Belgium, and France. It is believed that the Lowchen may be one of the founding breeds in the development of the Toy Poodle or may be linked to the founding breed. Another theory is that the Lowchen is related to the Bichon breeds and originated in the Mediterranean. The third and possibly fourth theories are that the Lowchen may have originated in Russia or even Tibet. Wherever the breed originated, we do know that its primary purpose was as a companion dog. It may also have been used as a rodent hunter and possibly as a little alarm dog. We also know that people in all stations of life owned the Lowchen, and they could be found in farms and castles alike. The Lowchen has been depicted in art around the world through the centuries and the breed today is relatively unchanged from what it looked like centuries ago. Over the years, Lowchen became less popular, and toward the end of the 19th century only a few remained. In 1897, a breeder named Madelaine Bennert took on the effort to save the Lowchen from the brink of extinction. She was successful, although World Wars I and II again threatened to wipe out the breed. Madame Bennert restarted her effort to save the breed and spent the years after the war searching for the remaining Lowchen lines that had escaped the war. With the help of Dr. Hans Rickert, whose dogs were originally purchased from Madame Bennert and are the dogs that contributed to the breed as they are today, and a few other owners and breeder, the Lowchen was able to recover as a breed. Although he is still rare today, the Lowchen is assured of a future. The first Lowchen arrived in the United States in 1971, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1999.
The Lowchen is slightly longer than he is tall. The ideal height for a Lowchen is 12 to 14 inches, and he generally weighs between 9 and 18 pounds.
The Lowchen is the personification of an even-tempered breed. He is lively and active, affectionate and gentle. He is an intelligent dog who learns quickly and easily. Lowchen are fearless watchdogs and will often alert bark if they see something or someone suspicious. They don"t seem to mind that they are small and will challenge larger dogs if they feel the need. They take control of their home, and their people may feel as if they"ve become a beloved possession of their sweet little dog. There is no doubt that the Lowchen is a wonderful breed with a cheerful disposition who has many people opening their hearts and homes to not just one but to many Lowchen companions. The Lowchen is a wonderful breed to train. They are intelligent and take to training very quickly. Like many toy breeds, they can have issues with housetraining, but this can be overcome with patience and consistency. Socialization is a must for this breed, which can be shy around people. Lowchen that are not properly socialized can become fearful or timid. They generally get along well with other pets, but socialization with other dogs is important for all breeds.
Lowchens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Lowchens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Lowchens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified on a yearly basis. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.
Lowchen make excellent apartment residents, but they can be prone to excessive barking. It is important to take this trait into consideration before bringing a Lowchen into your home since some apartment buildings and neighborhoods have noise restrictions. The Lowchen is not an outdoor dog or a kennel dog. Although they enjoy going outside to play and romp and enjoy the company of other dogs, their heart lies with their people and they prefer being with them whenever they can.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Lowchen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Lowchen has a dense coat that is long and moderately wavy with a soft texture. Lowchens can be found in all colors and combinations, and there is no preference for any one color or combination. Lowchens can be clipped or kept in a natural coat. When clipped, they are given a "Lion Trim." The hair is shortened to 1/8th of an inch in length from the last rib to the rump, as well as on the legs, with cuffs of hair just above the feet. The tail is also trimmed, with a plume left at the tip of the tail. Regular brushing keeps the coat from tangling. This breed sheds very little. Brush your Lowchen"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Lowchen to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Lowchen make excellent dogs for families with either children or other pets. They generally do well with children and enjoy playing with them. They are surprisingly robust and exceedingly gentle. Lowchen are also very sociable and will do well in homes with other pets and dogs. Unaware of their small size, they often have a desire to challenge larger dogs that they meet in public, so it"s important to protect them from themselves.
Lowchens are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Lowchens in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Lowchen rescue. Lowchen Club of America Rescue
