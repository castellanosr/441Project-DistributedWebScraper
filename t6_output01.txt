The Affenpinscher, also known as the "Monkey Dog" ("affen" means "ape/monkey" in German, and "pinscher" means "terrier"), is small but feisty, full of spunk and energy. This mustachioed little devil is descended from the numerous small terriers that populated 17th and 18th century stables and shops throughout Europe, ridding them of rats and mice.Some of the intelligent, wiry-haired dogs must have caught the eye of ladies, because eventually they were bred to be smaller, the better to be a companion dog. Today the Affen is a rare breed, but he came to public notice in 2002 when Ch Yarrow"s Super Nova won the Toy Group in 2002 at the nationally televised Westminster Kennel Club Show.This breed combines clownlike charm with a bold nature, and his creative thought process never ceases to astound and entertain his people. He learns quickly and adjusts readily to change, so he"s a good traveler who"s always ready for a new adventure. People who live with Affens admire their sensitivity and gentleness but warn that they are the quintessential big dog in a small body.Sturdy, smart, and alert, the Affenpinscher is an excellent watchdog who fears nothing. He"s not normally loud, but he is excitable. Once he"s on alert, it takes a while for him to calm down. He takes seriously his duty to guard home, family, and territory, and won"t hesitate to alert the entire neighborhood that someone is approaching the front door. Frequent socialization with other people and animals is a must for the Affenpinscher to grow up to be a balanced adult. Without it, he"ll never live up to his potential.The Affenpinscher has a mind of his own and is often labeled as stubborn. He needs early and consistent training. Fortunately, he"s eager to learn and to please his people when he"s taught with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. He can compete in obedience and agility, and his entertainment ability makes him a wonderful therapy dog. Who wouldn"t laugh to see him walking on his hind legs or waggling his eyebrows in a canine impersonation of Groucho Marx?While Affenpinschers are known for making their people laugh, they are not the best breed for a household full of children in spite of their antics. They aren"t known to particularly like children, and they won"t hesitate to bite if provoked.The Affen is a character, and that"s part of his appeal. Consider him if you"re interested in a small dog who enjoys seeing the sights, is an excellent watchdog, and will always make you laugh.
Like many toy dog breeds, the Affenpinscher can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. While the fur of an Affenpinscher is wiry and is often considered hypoallergenic, this is not to be mistaken with "non-shedding." All dogs shed or produce dander. Because of their heritage as ratters, Affenpinschers tend to not do well with rodent pets such as hamsters, ferrets, gerbils, etc. They do, however, tend to get along with fellow dogs in the household and can learn to get along with cats, especially if they"re raised with them. Affenpinschers are generally not recommended for households with toddlers or small children--it is not a breed that is naturally inclined to like children. The Affenpinscher is loyal to his adult family members and can be a great companion for a family with older children. The Affenpinscher is a rare breed. Be prepared to spend time on a waiting list if you"re interested in acquiring one. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Affenpinscher"s forebears date at least to the 17th century, though more reliable documentation of this breed date back only to the late 19th century. Paintings by Dutch artists as far back as the 15th century depict small, rough-coated, bearded dogs, and these may certainly be some of the Affenpinscher"s ancestors.Originating in Germany and utilized heavily throughout Central Europe for their rat-catching abilities, these terrier-type dogs were welcome employees in stables, shops, farms, and homes.Some of the intelligent, wiry-haired dogs must have caught the eye of ladies, because eventually they were bred to be smaller, the better to be a companion dog. Some sources credit a breeder in Lubeck, Germany, with being the first to miniaturize the ratters, but as with so many breeds, the story of how the Affenpinscher was created is lost to history.They may have been crossed with Pugs, smoothcoated German Pinschers, and a dog known as the German Silky Pinscher. Affenpinscher-type dogs also contributed to the development of other breeds, including the Brussels Griffon and the Miniature Schnauzer. It"s easy to see their relationship when you look at their rough coats and bearded faces.The city of Munich was the heart of early Affenpinscher development, but the breed was also popular elsewhere in Germany. The Berlin Lapdog Club began to formulate a breed standard for the Affenpinscher in 1902, but the true breed standard was not finalized until 1913.This standard, translated to English, was adopted by the American Kennel Club and the Affenpinscher was officially entered into the AKC Stud Book in 1936. The first Affen registered with the AKC was named Nollie v. Anwander, one of four German imports belonging to Bessie Mally of Cicero, Illinois.World War II interrupted the breeding of the Affenpinscher in the United States. It wasn"t until the 1950s that interest in the breed revived. He is still rare today, although he gained a bit of celebrity in 2002 when Ch Yarrow"s Super Nova won the Toy Group in 2002 at the nationally televised Westminster Kennel Club Show. The Affenpinscher ranks 125th among the breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
Affenpinschers are 9.5 to 11.5 inches tall and weigh 7 to 9 pounds.
The Affen is affectionate and curious, always on the alert. He"s loyal to his family and will do his tiny best to protect them from harm. It"s important to prevent him from taking on dogs ten times his size. He"s excitable and can take a while to calm down in the face of anything he views as a threat.Like every dog, Affenpinschers need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Affen puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Affenpinschers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Affens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts--the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)--is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Legg-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, this condition--a deformity of the ball of the hip joint--usually appears at 6 to 9 months of age and can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They"re an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Affens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Affenpinscher is an ideal dog for apartment living, especially if you have neighbors who don"t mind occasional barking. Short, brisk walks or a suitable length of time in the backyard is enough exercise for this sturdy but only moderately active dog.Because he"s so small, the Affenpinscher should be a full-time housedog, with access only to a fully fenced backyard when not supervised. These dogs won"t hesitate to confront animals much larger than themselves, an encounter that could result in tragedy.Like many toy breeds, the Affenpinscher can be difficult to housetrain. Be patient and consistent. Crate training is recommended.The key to training an Affenpinscher is to always keep training fun. Use lots of praise and motivation!
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Affenpinscher trim by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Affen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Shaggy but neat describes the Affenpinscher"s desired appearance. He has a thick, rough coat with a harsh texture, approximately one inch long on the body, shorter on the rump and tail, and longer and shaggier on the head (where it contributes to the monkeylike expression), neck, chest, stomach, and legs. The longer fur around the head and shoulders resembles a cape. Affens don"t shed much, but their rough coat must be stripped to maintain its characteristic texture.You"ll find the Affenpinscher dressed in black, gray, silver, black and tan, or red, which ranges from brownish to an orangey tan. Some red Affenpinschers have black, brown, or white hair mixed in with the red, along with tan furnishings, and some black Affenpinschers have a few white or silver hairs mixed in. The furnishings--the longer hair--may be a bit lighter than the rest of the body. In Europe, Affenpinschers come only in black, sometimes with a light frosting of gray.To maintain the shaggy but neat appearance, brush your Affen weekly with a small slicker brush, then comb him with a metal "greyhound" comb. Use your fingers to gently break up any mats or tangles you come across. It can help to spray them with detangler solution first. There"s a lot more to trimming and stripping the Affen"s coat to achieve his distinctive appearance, but it"s easily learned. Your dog"s breeder can show you how, or you can find instructions on the Affenpinscher Club of America website. Be patient and persistent while grooming your Affen, and you"ll both be happy with the results.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Like most small breeds, Affens have issues with periodontal disease. Brush their teeth several times a week to help remove tartar and bacteria. Daily is best.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Affenpinscher enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Affenpinscher to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Affenpinschers don"t like aggressive behavior such as hitting, unwanted squeezing or hugging, or chasing to catch them or cornering them to hold in a lap. If they can"t escape, they will defend themselves by growling or snapping. For these reasons, they are not good choices for homes with young children. Often young children don"t understand that a cute little Affenpinscher might not want "love and kisses."It"s a good idea to socialize any puppy to young children, even if he won"t be living with them, but you should always supervise their interactions. Never let young children pick up a puppy or small dog. Instead, make them sit on the floor with the dog in their lap. Pay attention to the dog"s body language, and put him safely in his crate if he appears to be unhappy or uncomfortable with the child"s attention.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Affenpinschers usually get along well with other dogs and cats in the family, but like most toy breeds they are completely unaware of their size and will take on dogs much bigger than themselves. Be prepared to protect them from themselves.
Affenpinschers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may wind up in need of adoption or fostering. Affenpinscher Rescue

The Afghan Hound was originally used for hunting large prey in both the deserts and in the mountains of Afghanistan, where his abundant, flowing coat was needed for warmth. The Afghan was highly valued for his ability to run — fast and over great distances — courageously holding dangerous animals, such as leopards, at bay until his huntsman on horseback caught up. The Afghan was also valued for his ability to think and hunt independently, without human direction. Today"s Afghan Hound isn"t hunting leopards but this sighthound does retain the independent nature of a coursing hound. An Afghan puppy will eagerly seek affection from family members, just like puppies of any breed, but this puppyhood behavior can fool unsuspecting owners. Cute puppy antics diminish as the Afghan matures. A mature Afghan Hound does not lavish attention on anyone, and sometimes doen"t even want to be hugged or petted. The free-thinking, independent Afghan will decide for himself when he wants affection, and it will be on his terms — not yours. Independence and indifference aside, the Afghan Hound is tender when he wishes to be and can be very amusing. Often referred to as a "clown" by his affectionate family, the Afghan Hound is known to be mischievous and stories abound of this breed"s ability to steal objects from under the very noses of family members, even going so far as to open dresser drawers and snatch clothes. With an ability to see far greater distances than humans and pivotal hip joints that enable him to cover ground quickly and easily clear obstacles, the Afghan is a natural for a sport called lure coursing. In lure coursing, the hounds give chase to plastic bags that are used to create the effect of escaping game. This competition tests the dog"s ability to hunt by sight, and basic coursing instinct. In 1972, the American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA) began, and continues to operate and oversee a program much loved by owners and dogs alike. Whether competing in a coursing event, or enjoying life as a playful family companion, the Afghan Hound is a one-of-a-kind breed.
Grooming is essential. Only those who really enjoy grooming, or are willing to pay a professional groomer to do it, should consider an Afghan Hound. The Afghan"s natural hunting instinct prompts him to chase prey (the neighbor"s cat, your son"s rabbit, the third grade class hamster, etc.). The Afghan Hound can be challenging to train due to his independent nature. Training can take a long time and requires patience. House training can be difficult. This breed can continue having accidents in the house up to about six months of age. The Afghan Hound has a low pain tolerance. A minor wound is more bothersome to this breed than to other breeds, and this dog can sometimes seem whiny or babyish. Afghan Hounds are sensitive and high-spirited and do not respond well to rough handling--so be gentle. Although this particular breed is usually good and even loving with children, it is best if the puppy grows up with the children he"ll live with and the children are mature enough to understand the importance of being considerate of this dog"s sensitive nature. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Afghan Hound comes from Afghanistan, where the original name for the breed was Tazi. The breed has long been thought to date back to the pre-Christian era. DNA researchers have recently discovered that the Afghan Hound is one of the most ancient dog breeds and dates back thousands of years. The first documentation of a Western Afghan breeder is that of an English officer stationed near Kabul. Afghan Hounds from his Ghazni Kennel were transported to England in 1925, and then made their way to America. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1926 and the Afghan Hound Club of America was admitted for membership with the AKC in 1940. Zeppo Marx of the Marx Brothers was one of the first to bring Afghan Hounds to America. In the late 1970s, the hound"s popularity soared when Barbie, who is responsible for more than 80 percent of Mattel"s profits, and Beauty, her pet Afghan Hound, found their way into the homes and hearts of countless American girls. During this same decade, the development of lure coursing competitions added to the breed"s appeal. In the 1980s, the Afghan became a popular AKC show ring star and, in spite of its independent nature, has branched out into obedience competition.
Males are 27 inches (plus or minus one inch) and about 60 pounds, and females 25 inches (plus or minus one inch) and about 50 pounds.
The Afghan Hound is typically a one-person or one-family dog. Do not look for this hound to eagerly greet your guests. More likely, he will offend them by being indifferent to their presence. While some hounds may bark once or twice when a stranger enters the home, this breed is not known to be a good watchdog. The independent thinking of the Afghan makes it a challenge to train. This hound is generally not motivated by food and does not possess as strong a desire to please as many other breeds (Golden Retriever, for example). Though the Afghan makes a stunning presentation in the show ring, for example, more than one professional handler has been embarrassed in the ring by a refusal to cooperative. Even so, this breed is known for outperforming other breeds when the decision to do so is his own. Rough handling can cause this dog to become withdrawn or mildly antagonistic. Gentle handling, kindness, and patience work best with this breed, along with an understanding that there will be times when the dog simply will not cooperate.
Afghans are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Afghans will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Afghans, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Allergies: Symptoms in the Afghan are the same as in people: sneezing, eye and nasal discharge, itching, hair loss, and lethargy. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Juvenile cataracts: The Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) defines cataracts as a "partial or complete opacity of the lens," and warns this is the leading cause of vision loss in dogs. Depending on the severity, cataracts may sometimes be removed surgically. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. Symptoms include chronic ear infections, bacterial infections of the skin, hair loss, lethargy, and depression. This condition is most commonly treated with medication and diet.
Afghan Hounds prefer being inside with family. They"re laid back and calm in the house but are naturally active dogs and need daily exercise, which ideally includes a leash walk or run, plus a free-run in fenced area. High, secure fencing is a must if you plan on keeping your hound in a yard. The Afghan is an adept escape artist and once loose, is truly hard to catch. (Remember, he can outrun horses!) Consistent obedience training is necessary and positive reinforcement methods work best.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Afghan in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Afghan, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Properly groomed, the Afghan coat is spectacular. It is very fine in texture, similar to human hair, and thick and silky. On the head is a long, silky topknot. With the exception of the back, the entire body is abundantly covered in hair, even the ears and feet. The hair is short and close along the back and smooth in mature dogs. All solid colors are allowed by the American Kennel Club breed standard (standardized guidelines for the breed), with certain color combinations considered the most pleasing. Grooming is a must for the Afghan. Because the coat is fine, it has a tendency to tangle easily. Regular, even daily, brushing and combing is necessary, as is frequent bathing. Many owners elect to hire a professional groomer to keep the coat in good condition because grooming the Afghan is so time consuming and difficult; it is certainly not a job for beginners, though owners can learn to manage the coat if they are willing to work hard. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Afghan"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Afghan may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Afghan"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Irish Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Afghan to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Afghan"s independent nature and large size make him best suited as an adult companion. The Afghan is not likely to want to follow around and play with children. In fact, a child"s quick movements and noise level can startle the Afghan. With proper socialization, though, the Afghan can adjust to life in a family with children and be loving and with them. The Afghan tends to most enjoy the company of his own kind--other Afghan Hounds. The Afghan will tolerate, even be indifferent, to other pets in a household. Not surprisingly, the Afghan"s hunter"s instinct leads him to chase small animals, especially if they run away.
Afghans are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Afghans in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Afghan rescue.

During World War I, a hardy Airedale Terrier named Jack braved the battlefields to deliver a message to British headquarters. Running through a half-mile of swamp, artillery raining down on him, Jack suffered a shattered leg and broken jaw. Sadly, he passed away soon after he"d completed his mission. Incredibly, the message he was carrying saved his battalion and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for "Gallantry in the Field." The bravery and courage exhibited by Jack holds true for today"s Airedales. Dogs like Jack were bred as a multi-purpose dog who had the keenness of a terrier, but could swim and smell prey. Airedale Terriers have the distinction of being both a sporting and working dog, and today compete in agility, obedience, and hunt tests. They enjoy life the most when there is a job to be done, even if it is simply entertaining children, with whom he gets along splendidly. (Nevertheless, an adult should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs.) Like all terriers, the Airedale has a penchant for digging, chasing, and barking. He is full of energy and makes an excellent jogging companion. Daily walks and romps in the yard are among his favorite activities. You can"t talk about the Airedale without mentioning his independent streak. This is an intelligent dog who thinks for himself and does not always wait for direction from his owner. If you want a highly biddable dog that awaits your every command, the Airedale Terrier is not the breed for you. However, if you are stimulated by challenge, living with an Airedale may suit you. It"s worth mentioning that the Airedale Terrier is unforgiving of any harsh treatment and will hold a grudge against the aggressor. He can be aggressive to other dogs and animals, and has a strong prey drive, which makes him difficult to handle at times. It is said that the Airedale doesn"t start fights — he finishes them. Consistent, positive obedience training is a must, as is a securely fenced yard. Not surprisingly, the Airedale is an excellent watchdog. He will protect his family from intruders with fierce and brave loyalty. However, he is friendly to invited guests in his home. Make no mistake: The Airedale isn"t all business — his flipside is comical and playful. He enjoys the company of his family, and he loves romping and playing, tossing toys, stealing dirty socks, grabbing food off the kitchen counter, and just generally creating mischief. He matures slowly, and is often puppyish well into old age. The Airedale is a fascinating breed. He"s courageous and athletic, stylish and silly. Many owners say that the only thing better than one Airedale Terrier is two.
Like all Terriers, Airedales have a natural inclination for digging (usually in the middle of a beautiful flower garden), chasing small animals, and barking. The Airedale Terrier is an active collector of human memorabilia. He will pick up just about anything (socks, underwear, children"s toys) to add to his stash of treasures. Being a high-energy working dog, the Airedale Terrier needs daily exercise. In general, the he remains active and full of energy throughout his life. He is not suited to apartment life, and needs a home with a large, fenced yard. Chewing is another favorite Airedale habit. He will chew anything, and should be left in a crate or secure kennel with sturdy toys when you are away from home. The Airedale is an independent dog, but he enjoys being a member of a family. He is happiest when inside with his owners, and is not meant to be a backyard dog. Airedale Terriers are very good with children and are fondly called reliable babysitters. However, children and dogs should never be left unsupervised. Grooming is necessary, so plan on paying a professional groomer or learn to groom your Airedale yourself. Training and socialization is essential to teach the Airedale proper canine manners. If he is not used to other dogs and people, he can be quarrelsome. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Airedale has the distinction of being the largest of the Terriers. The first attempt at creating the Airedale Terrier, although no one had a blueprint in mind at that time, was in 1853. A Rough-Coated Black and Tan Terrier was bred with an Otterhound in hopes of creating a well-rounded sporting dog that could hunt otters in the rivers and rats on land. The first crossbreeding produced a dog that possessed the keenness of a terrier and was able to swim and scent game. The crosses were called Waterside or Bingley Terriers and within 12 years of the first crossbreeding, the dog had become a popular sporting terrier. In 1864, the first dog show in the Aire Valley was held and the Waterside Terrier competed under the Broken-Haired Terriers class (the Waterside or Bingley Terrier name was not mentioned until 1879). Author Hugh Dalziel, after judging the dog at a show, went on to describe the Bingley Terrier as "par excellence... an exceedingly good one." His comments brought immediate interest in the breed and a cry of protest from its fans who decried the fact that Dalziel pinpointed Bingley as the breed"s birthplace. At this time, a group of fanciers joined together and decided that the Waterside or Bingley Terrier should be renamed the Airedale Terrier. It is believed that the actual name was first suggested by Dr. Gordon Stables, who had judged the dogs a year before Dalziel, but that fact is difficult to validate. In 1880, Dalziel again had the opportunity to judge the Airedale Terrier and referred to the dog as such in his report. The name Airedale Terrier was not accepted or commonly used at first, which generated much confusion. At various shows, classes were made for either one or all three names for the breed and it wasn"t until 1886, that the Kennel Club in England accepted Airedale Terrier as the official name of the breed. The Airedale Terrier Club of America was founded in 1900 and, in 1910, the club started a perpetual trophy that is offered at parent club shows. This trophy is known as the Airedale Bowl and has the names of winners" engraved on the bowl and pedestal. Airedale Terriers were used throughout World War I as messengers, sentries, carriers of food and ammunition, scouts, ambulance dogs, ratters, Red Cross casualty dogs, sled dogs, and guard dogs. The war brought stories of the Airedale Terrier"s bravery and loyalty and sparked popularity in the breed. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Warren Harding, and Calvin Coolidge were among the many people who owned and fancied the breed. In 1949, the Airedale Terrier was ranked 20th in popularity by the American Kennel Club, but has since dropped in rank. Part of this decline is due to the increased use of German Shepards in roles traditionally filled by Airedales.
Males stand 23 inches tall, and weigh about 50 to 65 pounds. Females are slightly shorter, and weigh 40 to 55 pounds.
The Airedale is a hard-working, independent, and athletic dog with a lot of drive, energy, and stamina. He is prone to digging, chasing, and barking — behaviors that come naturally to terrier breeds. These traits can be frustrating to owners unfamiliar with the Airedale personality. If you are thinking about an Airedale, consider whether you are willing to live with his propensity toward potentially undesirable behaviors — and whether you want to take on the challenges that go along with his independent nature. If you decide you are, you will be delighted with the Airedale"s active, fun-loving, even comical attitude. The Airedale is a lively breed, and he needs plenty of activity. Don"t leave him alone for long periods of time, or he is likely to become bored, which leads to the aforementioned destructive behaviors. Keep training interesting and fresh — repetitive exercises will become a bore to the Airedale. He is best motivated by treats and other positive reinforcement methods; drill-and-jerk training methods should be avoided. A reliable watchdog, the Airedale takes pride in protecting his family. He can be a fierce guardian, but is friendly with his family and friends. Ultimately, temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Airedale needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Airedale puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Airedales are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Airedales will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Airedales, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Airdale is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Umbilica Hernia: Present at birth, this is an affliction in which abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left untreated. Some small hernias spontaneously close by the time the puppy is 6 months old and some dogs live with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done while the dog is spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition in which an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening strangulation of the intestine. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis: This disorder causes vomiting and diarrhea with either fresh or digested blood. This disorder comes on very quickly, and the cause is unknown. Diagnosing is a process of elimination because many other diseases cause similar symptoms. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis needs prompt medical treatment. Although it run its course within a few days, the dog needs treatment of intravenous fluids to keep hydrated. If the dog becomes dehydrated, his red blood count will continue to rise until the blood becomes thick and slow moving. This can cause another disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and can result in death. The disorder is also treated with antibiotics and anti-ulcer medications. Cancer: Like humans, dogs can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancers, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically.
The Airedale Terrier is a working dog, and has the energy and stamina that goes with it. He needs regular exercise — at least one walk a day, although two is preferable, coupled with a good romp in the backyard. The Airedale loves to retrieve, play, swim, and goof around. He is a great jogging companion, and in many cases, will tire out his owner. Training and socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people) are essential for the Airedale, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Airedale with you to many different places — the pet supply store, outdoor events, long walks in busy parks. (Even if you don"t imagine many children will be visiting your home, it is important to expose him early to kids of all ages.) Anywhere there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Airedale. Crate training is also strongly recommended with the Airedale Terrier. Not only does it aid in housetraining, it also provides him a safe den in which to settle down and relax. In general, Airedales do very well with most training as long as you remember that they have a mind of their own. Ask him to sit or stay in full sunlight in the middle of the summer and it"s very likely he"ll decide he"d prefer to do so in the shade. Positive reinforcement is the best way to teach an Airedale. If you approach training with a positive, fun attitude, and you have a lot of patience and flexibility, there"s an excellent chance you will have freethinking Airedale who is also well trained.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Airedale in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Airedale, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The handsome coat of the Airedale Terrier has two layers: a topcoat, which is dense and wiry, and an undercoat, which is short and soft. Most Airedales Terriers have a specific coat combination: the majority of the dog is tan (ears, legs, head, underbelly, and occasionally the shoulders) and the back and upper sides are either black or grizzled (black mixed with gray and white). Sometimes there is a speckling of red in the black and a small white star on the chest. The Airedale Terrier is not known for extreme shedding, but he does shed certain times of the year. Regular brushing keeps the coat in good condition (once or twice a week), and periodic bathing as needed (over-bathing is not recommended, as this softens the coarse terrier coat). The family Airedale doesn"t have to be trimmed, but most owners do have him groomed by a professional groomer three to four times a year to give him a neat appearance (an untrimmed coat is thick, curly, and unruly). The coat is either trimmed with clippers, by stripping (a process by which the coat is thinned and shortened with a sharp, comb-like tool called a stripping knife), or a combination of both. Paying a professional groomer to groom your Airedale is costly, and should be taken into consideration when selecting this breed. Highly motivated owners can learn how to trim their own dogs, but it"s not easy and is time consuming. Brush your Airedale"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Airedale to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The fun-loving Airedale makes a good family pet. In some cases, he may even become protective of the children in the home, but his large size and high activity level may prove too intense for extremely young kids. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Airedale gets along well with other dogs in his household, as long as he is properly socialized and trained. He can be aggressive, however, with strange dogs that he perceives as threatening. And given the Airedale"s reputation as a hunter, he is very likely to chase animals he perceives as prey, including cats, rabbits, gerbils, and hamsters.
Airedales are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Airedales in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Airedale rescue.

The Akita is a big, bold dog with a distinctly powerful appearance: a large head in contrast to small, triangular eyes; and a confident, rugged stance. The mere presence of a powerful Akita serves as a deterrent to most who would cause trouble.This breed is renowned for unwavering loyalty to his owners, and he can be surprisingly sweet and affectionate with family members. Imagine a loving protector who will follow you from room to room, whose entire mission in life seems to be simply to serve you.The Akita is courageous, a natural guardian of his family. Stubborn and willful, he won"t back down from a challenge. He doesn"t usually bark unless there is a good reason, but he is vocal, making amusing grunts, moans, and mumbles. Some owners says the Akita mutters under his breath and seems to be talking to himself, while others say the Akita offers his opinion on all matters, from how to load the dishwasher to when the children should be put to bed.While these charming "talking" traits are exhibited to family, the Akita is often aloof and silent with visitors. He"s naturally wary of strangers, though he will be welcoming enough to a houseguest as long as his owners are home.Socializing the Akita puppy (or retraining an adult dog) with as much exposure to friendly people as possible can help soften the edge of his wariness, though an Akita will always be an Akita — a dignified and sober presence, not a party animal.One of the Akita"s singular traits is mouthing. The Akita loves to carry things around in his mouth, and that includes your wrist. This is not an act of aggression, but simply an Akita way of communicating with those he loves. He may lead you to his leash because he wants to go for a walk, for example, or act on any number of other ideas that pop into his intelligent head.Many owners are charmed by the Akita"s mouthing, but if you find it annoying, simply give your Akita a job that involves carrying something. He would happily get the newspaper or your slippers for you, or retrieve the mail or even those keys you keep misplacing.The Akita also proves himself unusual with his grooming habits, licking his body like a cat. And that"s not his only feline trait: like a tiger, he"ll stalk his prey silently, body low to the ground. This is not a dog that will growl or bark a warning before springing into action.At 100 pounds or more, the Akita is a lot of muscular power. This is a dominating breed, and the Akita will want to dominate you. Proper training is essential, and training should be done by the owner. Because the Akita is so faithfully loyal, the bond between the owner and the dog must not be broken by boarding the dog with a trainer.Before buying an Akita, it is crucial to spend time researching how to train this particular breed. Akitas do not respond well to harsh training methods. If your training is respectful, the dog will in turn respect you.But be prepared for training to take longer than it does for other breeds. Though the Akita is highly intelligent, stubborn willfulness is a part of his personality, which can and does interfere with training. The best results come from doing plenty of homework on how to train before ever bringing an Akita home with you. This is not a breed for the timid.The willful and determined Akita is also, despite his public reserve, a very social pet who needs plenty of time with his family. He does not do well as a backyard dog. Companionship holds hands with loyalty, which is what this breed is all about. To make him live outside without benefit of family is to deny the very essence of the Akita breed. A lonely and bored Akita can become destructive and aggressive.The Akita is not recommended for first-time dog owners, for those who want a lapdog, or for those unwilling to take charge. But for owners who can and will invest time and effort in research and proper training, the reward is a fine, intelligent companion with unwavering loyalty.In addition to all other considerations, choosing an Akita means deciding which side of a controversy you want to stand on. This controversy is "the split," and it relates to the Japanese or American standard for the breed.The Japanese Akita is considerably smaller, both in height and mass, than the American Akita — as much as 30 or more pounds lighter. His foxlike head is decidedly different from the broad head of the American breed. The Japanese Akita has almond-shaped eyes, while the American Akita"s eyes are triangular. A black mask is much in vogue on the American Akita but is considered a show disqualifier in Japan, where markings on the face are white.If you want your dog to compete in any American Kennel Club events, the black mask means the dog has been bred to the American standard and will be allowed to compete. In fact, in America, any color on the Akita is permitted; in Japan, only red, white, and some brindles are allowed.So wide are the differences between the types that it would seem that a split would be best for the breed. There appear to be as many strongly in favor of the split as there are those who are strongly against it. Deciding which standard to choose should be done only after much research and is largely a matter of personal taste.The Akita"s natural hunting skills translate well to various activities. He still hunts today and is able to hold large game at bay until the hunter arrives. He can also retrieve waterfowl. He is adept at tracking, and his catlike movements make him talented in agility. Akita owners are increasingly surprising those skeptics who believe that the Akita nature prevents success in this field. While it"s true that the breed"s stubbornness can make training a challenge, Akitas and their owners are taking home ribbons as more people discover the thrill of accomplishment in working with this dog.
To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments. The Akita is aggressive with other dogs and is especially prone to same-sex aggression. The Akita is not a good choice for first-time dog owners. Positive socialization and consistent, firm training are essential for the Akita. If he is mishandled or mistreated, he often responds by becoming aggressive. The Akita will chase other pets in the house. The Akita sheds — a lot! Prolonged eye contact is considered a challenge by the Akita, and he may respond aggressively. Training the willful Akita can be challenging and requires understanding, experience, and patience. It"s best to work with a trainer familiar with the breed, but be sure to do the training yourself.
The Akita is named for the province of Akita in northern Japan, where he is believed to have originated. The Akita"s known existence goes back to the 1600s, when the breed guarded Japanese royalty and was used for hunting fowl and large game (including bears).This valiant breed was introduced to America by a woman of no small stature: Helen Keller. The Japanese held Helen Keller in high esteem and took her to Shibuyu to show her the statue of Hachiko, an Akita who achieved worldwide fame in the 1920s for his loyalty. Hachiko"s owner, a professor, returned from work each day at 3 p.m., and his devoted dog met him daily at the train station. When the professor died, loyal Hachiko continued his daily vigil until his own death a full decade later.When Helen Keller expressed her desire to have an Akita for her own, she was presented with a puppy, the first Akita brought to America. Keller was delighted with Kamikaze-go and was deeply saddened when he died of distemper at a young age. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese government officially presented her with Kamikaze"s older brother, Kenzan-go. Keller later wrote that Kamikaze had been "an angel in fur" and that the Akita breed was "gentle, companionable, and trusty."After World War II, returning American servicemen who had been stationed in Japan brought back more Akitas. Thomas Boyd is credited with producing the first Akita stud to sire puppies in the U.S., starting in 1956. The American Akita eventually evolved into a more robust dog than the Japanese Akita and was valued by many for this reason.Yet there were those who wanted to remain true to the Japanese standard. This split caused a decades-long battle that led to a delay in acceptance by the American Kennel Club. Finally, in 1972, the AKC accepted the Akita Club of America — but the split is still wide today and is a matter of great concern to Akita fanciers on both sides.What is never debated is the Akita"s historical and famous combination of fearlessness and loyalty. These traits were once put to the test at the London Zoo, when a Sumatran tiger cub was orphaned. The zookeepers needed special help in raising the cub, and they chose an Akita puppy for this important task. They knew the Akita would not be frightened and could engage in play that would help the tiger cub with necessary life lessons. Moreover, the Akita"s dense fur would protect him from sharp claws, and the pup"s inherent loyalty to his playmate would provide desired companionship and protection for the bewildered, orphaned cub. The Akita served in the role successfully and "retired" from the job when the tiger reached near-adulthood.This is a dog who is truly fearless, fully confident, and will exhibit unfaltering devotion to family.
Males stand 26 to 28 inches and weigh 85 to 130 pounds. Females stand 24 to 26 inches and weigh 70 to 110 pounds.
The Akita is a bold and willful dog, naturally wary of strangers but extremely loyal to his family. He is alert, intelligent, and courageous. He tends to be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex. He is best suited to a one-dog household.With his family, the Akita is affectionate and playful. He enjoys the companionship of his family and wants to participate in daily activities. He"s mouthy and enjoys carrying toys and household items around. Despite the common belief that he never barks, he is in fact noisy, known to grumble, moan — and, yes, bark if he believes the situation warrants it.Be aware the Akita"s strong personality can be overwhelming. He is not the dog for a first-time owner, and he is not for the timid. He needs an owner who can provide firm, loving discipline.Activity is essential for this active breed. He needs plenty of exercise to keep him from becoming bored and, in turn, destructive.The naturally protective Akita has a propensity to become aggressive if allowed, or if he isn"t raised properly. Training the Akita is essential, and so is proper socialization from an early age. Keep in mind that this breed is stubborn, so extra patience is necessary to teach him proper canine manners.
Akitas are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Hip dysplasia is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Gastric dilatation-volvulus, commonly called bloat, is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Akitas. It is especially a problem if they eat one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively, and is retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, showing a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Sebaceous adenitis (SA) is a serious problem in Akitas. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed (for unknown reasons) and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that helps prevent the skin from drying out. Symptoms usually first occur when the dog is from one to five years old: affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin and hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if she suspects SA and will then discuss a variety of treatment options with you.
The Akita is happiest and does best when living inside with his family. This breed is not hyper, but he does need daily exercise. Thirty minutes to an hour a day is sufficient for an Akita; brisk walks, jogging (for an adult dog over two years of age), and romping in the yard are favorite activities. Visits to a dog park are probably not a good idea, given the Akita"s aggressive tendency toward other dogs.Due to this breed"s high intelligence, a varied routine is best. What you don"t want is a bored Akita. That leads to such behavior problems as barking, digging, chewing, and aggression. Include the Akita with family activities, and don"t leave him alone for long periods at a time.A securely fenced yard is important, too, both for the safety of the Akita and for the safety of strangers who may mistakenly come into his turf. While he isn"t typically aggressive with visitors if his family is home, when he"s reserved and polite, all bets are off if his owners aren"t around. The Akita is a loyal guardian, and he"ll protect against anything he perceives to be a threat.Special care must be taken when raising an Akita puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. In addition, don"t let your Akita puppy run and play on hard surfaces ,such as pavement; normal play on grass is fine. Avoid forced jumping or jogging on hard surfaces until the dog is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed (puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps, are fine).
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Akita, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
There are many different colors and color combinations in the American Akita, including black, white, chocolate, a combination of color and white, or brindle. The Akita is double-coated, with the undercoat being very dense and plush; the topcoat is short.Overall, grooming the Akita isn"t terribly difficult. But the Akita is a shedder, so frequent vacuuming will be your new lifestyle if you choose this breed. Akita fur will be found on furniture, clothing, dishes, in food, and will form myriad dust bunnies on floors and carpets. Heavier shedding occurs two or three times a year. Weekly brushing helps reduce the amount of hair in your home, and it keeps the plush coat of the Akita healthy.Despite his self-grooming habits, the Akita also needs bathing every three months or so. Of course, more often is okay if your dog rolls in a mud puddle or something smelly. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe the ears out weekly, using a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner, to prevent problems.As with all breeds, it is important to begin grooming the Akita at an early age. Making grooming a positive and soothing experience will ensure easier handling as your Akita puppy grows into a large, willful adult.
Adults should always supervise interactions between dogs and kids, and this is especially true with this breed. No child could have a more loyal guardian and playmate than an Akita — but a mistreated Akita can become a liability and may even endanger your child"s life. It is imperative to teach youngsters to be respectful and kind in all their interactions with him.That said, the Akita is suitable for families with older children. He should live in a one-pet household, however, because he is aggressive toward other dogs and will chase other pets.
Akitas are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Akitas in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Akita rescue organization. Akita Club of America

Unlike the Alaskan and Siberian Huskies they are descended from, Alaskan Klee Kais are meant to be companion dogs, rather than working animals that pull sleds. While they look similar to Huskies, Alaskan Klee Kais have some obvious differences in temperament, including their wariness of strangers. While they don"t care for unfamiliar faces, they are very loving family dogs, and their constant vigilance makes them good watchdogs. Alaskan Klee Kais adore attention from their humans and are eager to please, which makes them highly trainable. Though they are a relatively new breed that is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, they are recognized by several other kennel clubs, and many breed standards have been established. That said, there is still variation among dogs within the breed, and some breeders are working to change less desirable temperament traits, such as skittishness. Alaskan Klee Kais are not bred by many, so they still remain a fairly rare breed throughout the world.
The words "Klee Kai" come from an Inuit term meaning "small dog," which is appropriate for this breed that is a smaller version of its Husky ancestors. The breed hails from Alaska where it was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to be a companion dog, rather than a working sled dog. Although it is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, Alaskan Klee Kais are a recognized breed in the United Kennel Club and the American Rare Breed Association among others. Solid white Alaskan Klee Kais do exist, but breed standards do not include this coat color. Although they can shed a lot, Alaskan Klee Kais do not require much grooming and mostly take care of themselves. Because they are skittish around strangers, these dogs require early socialization training that should last for the rest of their lives if they are to be friendly to unfamiliar faces. The high prey drive of the Alaskan Klee Kai may make them ill suited for homes with other small pets such as cats, rabbits, hamsters, etc. Though they love their human families, small children that are not taught how to interact with dogs may inadvertently hurt Alaskan Klee Kais during play or provoke them to nip or snap.
The Alaskan Klee Kai hails from Wasilla, Alaska where it was developed by a woman named Linda S. Spurlin and her family. She wanted to create a smaller type of Husky that could serve as a companion dog after she saw a small version of a Siberian Husky in Oklahoma, so when she returned to Alaska, she got to work creating the dog that we recognize as the Alaskan Klee Kai today. Unlike some breeders who wish to create smaller breeds, Spurlin did not breed dogs that suffered from dwarfism. Instead, she bred Siberian and Alaskan Huskies with breeds like the Schipperke and Alaskan Eskimo Dog to reduce the size of the puppies. About ten years after unveiling the Alaskan Klee Kai to the public, Spurlin retired from breeding, though other breeders continue to produce theses dogs. Still, they are few in number, and the breed remains rare. As a newer breed, the Alaskan Klee Kai has not been recognized by some kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club, as a purebred dog, though the breed has been recognized by the American Rare Breed Association since 1995 and the United Kennel Club since 1997.
The Alaskan Klee Kai comes in toy, miniature, and standard sizes, though there isn"t much difference between these sizes. Toy Alaskan Klee Kais are up to 13 inches tall, while miniatures are 13 to 15 inches in height, and standards are 15 to 17 inches. Most Alaskan Klee Kais are between 10 and 15 pounds, though there can be some as small as 5 pounds or as large as 22 pounds.
Alaskan Klee Kais are intelligent, energetic, and loving to their families. They don"t much care for strangers and require lifelong socialization training if they are to be friendly to new people. Their wariness of new faces does, however, make them excellent watchdogs.When it comes to training, Alaskan Klee Kais are quick to pick up on basic commands and may even find themselves at the top of the class. They are eager to please and highly food motivated, and they are more than capable of taking on agility training, which can help burn off some of their high energy throughout the day. Once they have at least a good, long walk and a healthy play session, they"re usually happy to spend the rest of the day being couch potatoes, but neglect their exercise needs, and they may become bored, anxious, and destructive. Be careful on walks, as these dogs have a high prey drive that may cause them to bolt if they see wildlife.Alaskan Klee Kais love to be the centers of attention in their families, but they will also be vocal when their needs are not being met. Though they do not tend to be overly mouthy and are generally quieter than their Husky forbears, they will bark and whine to express their displeasure, and they can be sensitive.
The Alaskan Klee Kai is considered to be quite a healthy breed with few genetic problems. However, owners should be aware that the breed is predisposed to certain conditions that they should keep an eye out for, including luxating patella, thyroid disease, heart conditions, liver shunts, factor VII deficiency, and cataracts. They may also keep their baby teeth, which can cause problems when adult teeth grow in. They may need to have these teeth removed.
When it comes to Alaskan Klee Kai care, it is very important to make sure their exercise needs are met, as they may become high strung and anxious if they do not have an outlet to burn off energy. Like any dog breed, they require regular teeth brushings, nail clippings, and ear cleanings. You should ask your veterinarian about your dog"s specific needs.
Alaskan Klee Kais are high energy dogs that need a diet that will fuel them throughout the day. Although their energetic nature makes their potential for weight gain fairly low, they need to maintain appropriate nutrition to stay healthy. You should consult your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist for insight on how to meet your Alaskan Klee Kais individual dietary needs.
There are three coat colors recognized as breed standards for the Alaskan Klee Kai. These include red and white, black and white, or gray and white, though solid white Alaskan Klee Kais have also been seen. These coats can be standard or full-coat. Both are double coats, meaning there is a short, soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer coat that protect dogs from extreme weather.Unlike many other breeds, Alaskan Klee Kais do not usually develop a dog odor, and they generally like to groom themselves, so they may not need to bathe as frequently as some other dogs. They will likely need regular brushing during the seasons in which their coats blow out, which happens before summer and winter. During this time, they tend to shed profusely, while they only shed moderately the rest of the year.
The Alaskan Klee Kai is a dedicated family dog that loves its humans, even children. However, they are small dogs, and children that are very young are not always taught how to interact with animals. They may injure or provoke Alaskan Klee Kais to nip. Children should always be supervised when playing with dogs, and the Alaskan Klee Kai is no exception to that rule.Alaskan Klee Kais are usually good with other dogs, especially if they have been socialized early on, though they have a high prey drive. This makes them ill suited for homes that have smaller pets unless they are specifically trained to live with them.

When you first see an Alaskan Malamute, it"s easy to be impressed by his large stature, wolf-like facial markings, and huge plumed tail waving at you. It"s often believed that Malamutes are part wolf. They might play a wolf on TV or in the movies, but in truth they"re all domestic dog.The Alaskan Malamute possesses tremendous strength, energy, endurance, independence, and intelligence. He was originally sought to pull heavy sleds over long distances as well as to hunt seals and polar bears. Now chosen primarily for companionship, Alaskan Malamutes succeed in several dog sports, including conformation, obedience competition, weight pulling, skijoring, backpacking, and recreational sledding.When he"s not "woo wooing" or pulling you on your inline skates or watching TV with you, he"s probably raiding the trash, surfing your kitchen counters for something good to eat, or digging a nice cool hole in the backyard.Malamutes regard everyone they meet as their friends. If you"re looking for a watchdog, this is not the breed for you. A Malamute"s size might scare off an intruder, but that"s about the only protection you"ll get from him.Alaskan Malamutes do best in situations in which they have plenty of room and opportunities to exercise so they don"t become bored and restless. Their independent nature often causes them to be labeled as stubborn or stupid, but their intelligence shines through with the correct training. If the Alaskan Malamute is the right breed for you, he will give you years of enjoyment as an active playmate and companion who keeps his puppy joie de vivre well into adult life.
Not recommended for the first time dog owner as their intelligence combined with stubbornness can make them a challenge for someone not savvy in dog behavior. Malamutes will challenge for alpha or top position in the household. Everyone who lives with the dog must be able to properly deal with this and clearly establish all family members as higher ranking than the Malamute. Alaskan Malamutes are notorious diggers. Any fencing should be buried so they cannot dig out of their yard. Alaskan Malamutes are a powerful, independent dog who, if not properly trained or exercised, can become destructive or bored. With early socialization and training, Malamutes can learn to get along with other dogs and indoor cats. They"ll view outdoor cats and other small animals as fair game. Their high prey drive can cause a Malamute to stalk and kill small animals, including birds, squirrels, cats and even smaller dogs. They need to be properly socialized and introduced to other companion animals. Alaskan Malamutes shed heavily twice a year. Their thick double coats are not suited for hot climates. Generally a quiet breed, Malamutes rarely bark. They do hold conversations with you, vocally expressing themselves with "woo woo" sounds or loud, extensive howls. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
One of the oldest Arctic sled dogs, the Alaskan Malamute"s forebears crossed the land bridge from Siberia to Alaska with native peoples thousands of years ago. One tribe, known as the Mahlemuts, settled in the northeastern area of the Seward Peninsula and it"s there that the Alaskan Malamute was developed. The dogs were used to hunt seals, chase away polar bears, and pull heavy sledges loaded with food or camp supplies.The Eskimos treated their dogs well and valued them highly. The gold rush of 1896 brough a great influx to Alaska of dogs of many sizes and breeds who could survive the weather. Many native dogs were interbred with these dogs and pure type was lost. The Mahlemuts were a relatively isolated tribe, so the Alaskan Malamute survived the incursion better than other breeds.Arthur T. Walden established his Chinook Kennel in New Hampshire and began breeding Alaskan Malamutes. He and his successors, Milton and Eva Seeley, supplied many dogs for the Byrd Antarctic expeditions in the 1930s. The Seeleys began a program to reproduce the dogs found in the Norton Sound area of Alaska. This strain of Alaskan Malamutes became known as the "Kotzebue" strain.A slightly different strain was developed by Paul Voelker, Sr. with dogs he bought in Alaska in the early 1900s and later in the 1920s. This strain was known as the "M"Loot" strain. Some of these dogs were used in World War I and II and by Admiral Byrd"s second expedition.The Alaskan Malamute Club of America was formed in 1935 and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed that same year. During World War II, most of the registered Alaskan Malamutes were loaned out for war duty because there was a great demand for sled dogs. Tragically, many of them were destroyed after serving their nation on an expedition to Antarctica during World War II.All AKC-registered Malamutes today can trace their ancestry back to the original Kotzebues or to dogs registered during the open period in the late 1940s. Today, the Alaskan Malamute ranks 57th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males stand 25 inches high at the shoulder and should weigh about 85 pounds; females tend to stand 23 inches high and weigh about 75 pounds. However, it"s not unusual for a well-muscled adult to top 100 pounds. In rare instances, so-called "giant" versions top 140 pounds, but the Malamute body is not designed to carry excess weight.
Alaskan Malamutes will win you over with their playful, outgoing dispositions. They greet everyone as a friend — even strangers and first-time houseguests — so they don"t make good watchdogs, but they are extremely loyal to their family and friends. Malamutes are pack animals, and they enjoy spending time with their human pack, insisting on being included in all activities that their family undertakes. They"re not big-time barkers, but they do howl and they"re known for making a characteristic "woo woo" sound.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Alaskan Malamutes need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malamute puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Malamutes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Malamutes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Malamutes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cataracts: Usually present by 1 to 2 years of age, known as juvenile cataracts. This type of cataract rarely progresses to blindness. Affected animals should not be used for breeding. Chondrodysplasia: This genetic disorder causes puppies to be born with deformities evident in the abnormal shape and length of their limbs. It"s commonly referred to as "dwarfism." There is now a genetic screening test to determine if the dog carries the gene for this condition. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. All dogs used in breeding programs should be screened for this condition. Hypothyroidism: This condition is often misdiagnosed because tests to evaluate the condition are not specific and can be inaccurate. Hypothyroidism is the result of abnormally low production of the thyroid hormones. Clinical signs vary depending on the severity of each case, but can include dry, coarse, and/or sparse coat, eye discharge, pale mucous membranes, and mental dullness. Hypothyroidism can be managed well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Inherited Polyneuropathy: This is generally characterized by a lack of coordination and instability that leads to a labored gait described as a bunny-hopping gait. The condition varies from mild to severe. An affected dog may fall down, walk on the tops of his feet, or his gait may just look a little off. Onset is usually quite sudden with most cases noted at approximately one year of age. Hemeralopia (Day Blindness): This usually begins to show when the puppy is eight weeks old and can be recognized easily by observant owners. Affected dogs bump into or stumble over things. They may be reluctant to come out into sunlight, preferring to stay in shaded areas. They seem to be feeling their way when negotiating steps into the house or disoriented when facing the sun. All these signs of clumsiness disappear at night. Hemeralopia can be managed to help the dog have an acceptable quality of life.
This member of the Working Group of dogs is definitely a task seeker. He thrives on long walks, hikes (while carrying a backpack), skijoring (pulling a person on skis), carting, and sledding. He needs to run, play, and generally bounce around a lot. Inadequate exercise will cause the Alaskan Malamute to become bored and destructive. Make sure, however, that the exercise matches the dog"s age, health condition, and activity level.Malamutes love to dig. Rather than trying to stop this behavior, your best bet is to accommodate it by giving your Malamute his own place to dig in the yard, such as a sandbox or other area that you don"t mind setting aside for him.Blessed with a dense double coat, Alaskan Malamutes can tolerate living outdoors in extremely cold climates. However, they do need adequate shelter and a fenced enclosure, preferably with a roof over it. Because Malamutes have an extremely high pack drive, they are happiest when residing with their pack in the house. They do well living inside a home because they keep their coats clean and are easy to housetrain.Not surprisingly, Malamutes are sensitive to heat. They"re Arctic dogs, not designed by nature to live in hot, humid environments. If your Malamute lives in the Sunbelt, be sure to provide him with plenty of shade, fresh water, and air conditioning during the summer, and avoid exercise in the heat of the day.Due to their size, strength, and smarts, it"s highly recommended that Malamutes be enrolled in obedience training at a young age before they are large enough and strong enough to outmaneuver — or outwit — their people.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Malamute in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Malamute, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Alaskan Malamute sports a dense double coat. The thick, coarse outer coat, known as the guard coat, should not be soft or long. The undercoat is one to two inches deep. It"s oily and woolly to repel wetness and cold.The coat length increases around the shoulders and neck, down the back, over the rump, and in the breeches (the furry covering over the thigh, which resembles pants) and plume of the tail. Speaking of the tail, some display a "cork-screw" appearance that enables the dog to place his tail over his nose to keep it warm during cold weather.This breed"s coat colors range from light gray to black, sable, and shades of sable to red. The underbelly should be predominantly white along with the feet, parts of the legs, and part of the face markings. The only solid color you"ll see is white. Some Malamutes may have an attractive white blaze on the forehead or around the neck.If you share your life with an Alaskan Malamute, expect your vacuum cleaner to get a regular workout and to schedule time for regular brushing sessions. Brushing one to three times weekly helps to keep the coat clean and distribute skin oils. Malamutes shed heavily twice a year, and the hair falls out in large clumps. At that time, frequent brushing with a slicker brush and/or undercoat rake helps keep the flurry of hair under control.One plus for this shedding breed is that the double coat is odorless. In addition, Malamutes have a cat-like tendency to keep their coats clean. Baths are rarely needed, usually one to two a year unless the dog gets into a smelly mess.Brush your Malamute"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Malamute to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Malamutes are patient with children and love the attention they get from them, but fast-growing, energetic Alaskan Malamute puppies can easily overpower a young child under age 5. In their exuberance, they can knock a child over.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.With early socialization and training, your Malamute should get along well with other dogs. He may chase small animals such as cats unless brought up with them and taught not to. It"s vital to properly introduce him to other animals in the household and supervise their interactions. He"ll consider outdoor cats and other small animals fair game.
Malamutes are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Malamutes in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Malamute rescue. Alaskan Malamute Assistance League

American Bulldogs are generally happy, family-loving dogs that do well in homes where they have plenty of space to roam. A big, fenced-in backyard is practically a must-have for one of these energetic dogs, though exercise needs may vary by specific type and breeding. They may be just fine with urban life, so long as they get plenty of walks, and they can even make good jogging or running buddies. They do not, however, take very well to being left alone for long periods of time, and they can feel cooped up in an apartment. If their physical and mental stimulation needs aren"t met, they can become bored and destructive. American Bulldogs need experienced owners who can be patient with training and start socialization early. So long as they are well trained, they"ll get along just fine with children and other pets, though it is still important to supervise them as you would with any dog. Whether they are used for hunting and farm work or just cuddling up with their humans, the American Bulldog makes for an excellent, loyal companion and a competent watchdog.
Although they were used for bull baiting a long time ago, they have since become working farm dogs and family companions. The breed almost went extinct near the end of World War II, but the breed has since been revived and is in no danger of disappearing. There are multiple types of American Bulldogs in modern times, and though they used to be mostly white, they now come in a variety of patterns and colors. This breed does not do well being left home alone for long hours, and they have high exercise needs. They are not well-suited for apartment life and prefer a large, fenced-in yard to roam around. Their appearance often gets them confused with the Dogo Argentino, which is a separate breed entirely. They may also be confused with American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Bulldog tends to be quite a bit larger. American Bulldogs can be suspicious of strangers and territorial, which can make them good watchdogs. They require socialization training so they know how to behave around invited guests.
The ancestor of the American Bulldog is the Old English Bulldog, which was brought to North America by working class immigrants who wanted to keep their working dogs to help on the farms. Rather than being concerned with maintaining breed purity or certain genetic traits, early farmers bred the dogs with the best working qualities for all-around farm work. The breed"s agility, intelligence, and loyalty made them very helpful for handling cattle, as well as hunting. Wild pigs were an invasive species not native to the American south that had no natural predators, and the strong jaws and muscular build of the American Bulldog was perfect for hunting them down.There is a sad part of the American Bulldog"s history, too. They were originally used in the barbaric sport of bull baiting. By the end of World War II, the American Bulldog was almost extinct until a few breeders scoured the south for specimens to revive the breed. Today, the American Bulldog is in no danger of extinction and is mostly a family-friendly companion.
This breed stands quite a bit taller than the English or French Bulldogs. Adorable American Bulldog puppies will grow to 20 to 28 inches in height and 60 to 120 pounds by the time they reach adulthood. Although these sizes are considered to be standard for the breed, American Bulldogs can be quite a bit larger or smaller.
American Bulldogs are friendly, intelligent, and affectionate, though that affectionate nature often leads them to be territorial and overly suspicious of strangers. This makes them lovely family dogs and watchdogs, even for families with children, but they will need socialization training, especially as puppies to get along with unfamiliar humans or other dogs that stop by for a visit. Luckily, their intelligence makes them highly adaptable and trainable.The American Bulldog is a playful breed that has some high exercise needs, and they do well in families that are able to stay active with lots of walks and play time. They aren"t the best breed to be kept in apartments or small spaces that don"t allow for them to burn off energy. When they aren"t physically or mentally stimulated, they can become destructive and chew on things they aren"t supposed to.
The American Bulldog is generally a healthy breed with a life expectancy of 10 to 16 years. Some are predisposed to certain medical conditions such as cataracts, mange, or hypothyroidism. If they suffer from obesity early in life, they may develop hip or elbow dysplasia.The breed is somewhat brachycephalic, meaning they have short snouts. This may make it more difficult for them to tolerate hot weather, especially while exercising. It is important to make sure they have enough water and monitor them and make sure they are not struggling to breathe.
Most of the care that is necessary for the health of an American Bulldog is meeting their needs for exercise and mental stimulation. Failing to do so can result in anxiety, boredom, and destructive behavior. So long as those needs are met, the rest is fairly standard. Maintain normal vet visits, check their ears weekly, keep up with monthly nail clipping and normal dental. One of the issues you may face is the potential for drooling that is common among bully breeds. You should take care to wipe your dog as needed unless you want a generous amount of slobber all over your home.
An American Bulldog diet should be formulated for a large to giant breed, and their high energy level should be taken into consideration. Their needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood. It is best to ask your veterinarian or professional nutritionist about your dog"s specific nutritional requirements. You should discuss with them how to form an appropriate diet for your dog.
American Bulldogs can come in several different colors. Traditionally they are white with patches of brindle, red, or black, but there are quite a few more color variations to the breed in modern times. They may have patterns that include shades of black, red, brindle, brown, or fawn. American Bulldogs usually have black on the nose and the rims of the eyes, but they may also have shades of pink. Their eye color is usually brown. Although these are breed standards, some American Bulldogs have been known to be merle or have coats that contain shades of blue.American Bulldogs have a short coat that sheds moderately throughout the year, and they don"t require extensive grooming. Weekly brushing should keep it under control with baths as needed.
As with most breeds, socialization training should begin early for American Bulldogs. So long as they are trained properly, American Bulldogs are great with children and are very loyal to all members of the family. It is also important to train children on how to properly handle and treat animals to avoid incident. Even with properly trained dogs, you should always supervise them when they play with children to make sure things don"t get out of hand. American Bulldogs are large animals, and overly energetic play can cause injuries.The same can be said for interactions with other pets. So long as American Bulldogs are socialized and trained, they usually get along with other dogs just fine. Play should be supervised, especially with smaller dogs that can easily get hurt when playing with a large, muscular American Bulldog. Generally, this breed is friendly, but injuries can happen when they are too eager to play rough or don"t know their own strength.

Once known as the Virginia Hound and adapted to hunt the rough terrain and tricky raccoons of the American colonies, the American English Coonhound is famous for his speed and endurance. He began as a dual-purpose dog who hunted fox by day and raccoon by night. He eagerly seeks his quarry, singing out as he hunts, a trait that carries over into home life. This hound will bark. On the plus side, he"s pleasant toward people and other dogs. If you won"t be hunting him, plan to give this swift and competitive dog plenty of daily exercise in other ways to prevent him from becoming frustrated and destructive. He"d make a good companion for a runner.

Perhaps it"s his white fluffy coat. Or jaunty personality. Or intelligence. Whatever "it" is, the American Eskimo Dog"s got it in spades, and he uses it to captivate his owners.The Eskie is primarily a companion dog, a devoted family member who thrives in the middle of family activities. He is cheerful, affectionate, sometimes rowdy, and very smart — so smart he"s thought to be one of the most intelligent dog breeds. He"s an independent thinker, curious, with an uncanny ability to problem-solve. He excels in activities that require him to use his brain, such as obedience training, tricks, agility, conformation, and other dog sports.Interestingly, Eskies were once favorite circus performers. With his adorable looks and ability to learn quickly, the Eskie traveled about the United States in the late 19th century, stunning audiences with his amazing tricks.With intelligence comes independence, however. The Eskie is a freethinker, and those who know him recommend obedience training starting from puppyhood. Otherwise, this smart dog will outsmart his owner. Training teaches him proper canine manners and respect for his pack leader — you.In spite of his diminutive size, the Eskie thinks big. He"s an excellent watchdog and will announce the comings and goings of strangers with barking — in fact, he can become a problem barker if left alone too long. Although he"ll warm up in time to those he doesn"t know, his first instinct is to be suspicious. The Eskie takes his watchdog duties very seriously, though he isn"t overly aggressive.If you want a breed that has a lot to say, consider the American Eskimo Dog. This breed is very vocal, engaging in barks, yowls, and even mumbles. Many owners claim that their Eskies "talk" to them.If the Eskie isn"t talking, he might be chewing. Most are avid chewers and need a constant supply of chew toys to keep them from munching "illegal" household items (and to help keep their teeth clean and healthy).The friendly Eskie is excellent with other dogs, cats, and children (though no dog of any breed should be left unsupervised with a young child).When it comes to activity, the American Eskimo Dog tends to be busy. He likes to keep moving, especially when young. (Older Eskies often become more sedate, preferring being petted and cuddled to running around.) Many owners keep more than one Eskie so the dogs can keep each other entertained, though lone Eskies do very well in busy households. Eskies make excellent apartment dogs as long as they are walked regularly and given plenty of opportunities for exercise.The American Eskimo Dog makes a beautiful, active companion for a household of one person or for a large family. A well-trained Eskie gives his family years of fun and joy.
Eskies are happy, active, intelligent dogs. They thrive on activity. Plan on keeping your Eskie busy with training classes, games, romps at a dog park, or hikes. A busy Eskie is unlikely to become bored — a state you want to avoid with this breed, because boredom leads to excessive barking, inappropriate chewing, and other annoying behaviors. The Eskie needs to be with his family, so don"t plan on leaving him alone for long periods at a time, or he may develop separation anxiety. If you are a confident leader, you"ll enjoy life with an Eskie. If you"re not, you"re apt to have an Eskie that"s leading you. Do not trust even a well-trained and well-socialized Eskie with small pets such as birds, hamsters, and gerbils. Chances are, he will succumb to his instincts and give chase. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The American Eskimo dog is a member of the Spitz family. Spitz dogs are Nordic dogs with foxlike faces, profuse coats, tails carried up over the back, and small, pricked ears. There is a great variety in the size of Nordic breeds, from the tiny Pomeranian to the large Samoyed.The true origin of the American Eskimo Dog is unknown. What is known is that in the United States, small, white Spitz-type dogs were commonly found in German immigrant communities. These dogs were most likely descendents of the white German Spitz, white Keeshonden, or large white Pomeranians that came to America with their German families. They came to be known collectively as American Spitz dogs.The American Eskimo Dog was a popular entertainer in the many circuses traveling throughout the United States during the 19th century. With his brilliant white coat and amazing ability to perform tricks, the Eskie was a favored showman. This widespread attention help popularize the breed.In 1917, the American Spitz was renamed the American Eskimo Dog, though today nobody really knows why. The American Eskimo Dog Club of America was founded in 1985, and in 1995, the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in the Non-Sporting Group.
The American Eskimo Dog comes in three sizes: Toy, Miniature, and Standard. Toys stand 9 to 12 inches and weigh about 10 pounds. Miniatures stand 12 to 15 inches and weigh about 20 pounds. Standards stand 15 inches to 19 inches and weigh about 30 pounds.
Not only does the American Eskimo Dog have a winning look, but he"s also got a winning personality. He"s spunky, clever, plays hard, and loves vigorous exercise. Because he is naturally suspicious of strangers, he makes an excellent watchdog.Eskies must have regular opportunities to vent their energy and use their busy minds. Otherwise, they can be rambunctious and bored, which usually leads to barking and chewing. A bored American Eskimo Dog can wreak havoc on your home and yard.The strong-willed Eskie also needs a confident owner who can take charge in teaching and leading him. He learns quickly, however, so training is fun and highly successful.Don"t plan on leaving this breed alone too much. He loves being part of a family and can suffer separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time. When you are away from home, it is wise to leave the Eskie in a crate or kennel, with sturdy chew toys, to keep him occupied and out of trouble until you return home.
Not all American Eskimo Dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This malady involves the hip joint. If your Eskie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This family of eye diseases involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Juvenile Cataracts: This condition can be a problem for some relatively young (less than six years old) Eskies. This is thought to be hereditary. When buying an American Eskimo Dog puppy, be sure to ask the breeder if her stock is certified by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation, and ask to see the certificates.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Eskies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Though he does well just about anywhere, it should comes as no surprise that the American Eskimo Dog loves cold climates. One of the joys of owning an Eskie is watching him play in the snow, which most Eskies love and will play in for hours. Many also enjoy water play.The Eskie does well in a variety of homes, from apartments to large houses with yards — as long as he"s an indoor dog. This breed isn"t suited for life in the backyard. He"s happiest when he"s with his family.American Eskimo Dogs need a lot of exercise. They are indeed large dogs in small packages, and they can become destructive if they don"t get regular exercise. They do well in busy households because their energy helps them keep up with everyone.Separation anxiety can be a concern for both Eskie and owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don"t leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave him, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Eskie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The white, fluffy American Eskimo Dog has a double coat with a dense undercoat and a longer outer coat. The hair is straight with no curl or wave. He has a pronounced ruff around the neck. His front and rear legs are well feathered, and the fur on his tail is profuse. He is most often pure white, or white and cream.Eskies shed a lot, and they require frequent brushing to cut down on the amount of fur left around the house, and to prevent matting (especially behind the ears). A thorough brushing two or three times a week is advised.Despite his light coloring, the Eskie is amazingly easy to keep clean. Eskie fur contains oil, which prevents dirt from adhering to it. When an Eskie gets dirty, the dirt usually brushes right out as long as the fur is dry.Eskies should only be bathed once every couple of months, depending on how dirty they get. Being bathed too often can cause skin problems, because it tends to make an Eskie"s skin dry and irritated. Unless they are very dirty, Eskies rarely have a doggie odor.Their ears should be checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with a gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner. Their toenails need trimming at least once a month.
The Eskie is an excellent family dog who"s affectionate with everyone, including kids of all ages, other dogs, and cats. Of course, adults should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs; the Eskie"s high energy level can be overwhelming to extremely young children, so supervision is especially important.The Eskie does not receive high marks for living in peace with small mammals and birds, which he tends to chase.
American Eskimo Dogs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an Eskie, a rescue group is a good place to start. Heart Bandits, the American Eskimo Dog Rescue

When you see foxhunters in movies or on television — or out in the field if you live in hunt country — packs of American Foxhounds are leading the chase. Or perhaps you were introduced to the breed through Rita Mae Brown"s Mrs. Murphy mystery series, set in Virginia hunt country with a number of American Foxhounds as key characters. This rare breed still lives and works the way its ancestors did when they came to this country more than 200 years ago. Bred to hunt in large packs, American Foxhounds were developed from hounds brought by English settlers, who adapted them to suit the game and terrain of their new land. American Foxhounds like the company of other dogs but can be a single companion dog if you"re committed to giving them the exercise they"d normally get running around with their canine friends, and to spending the time to help them bond with their human family. Despite their size, they"re mild-mannered unless they"re in pursuit of their quarry. Then they become relentless in the hunt. Like all hounds, the Foxhound is musical. Hounds are described as having bell-like voices, and their baying can carry for miles. It"s best not to bring one home unless you"re sure your neighbors will appreciate the concert or live far enough away that they won"t be disturbed.
The Foxhound is famed for his musical voice and his bays and howls can carry for miles; city living is not recommended for this breed. Foxhounds are easily distracted by various scents. Once he has decided to follow one, you"ll have a difficult time calling him off. Foxhounds aren"t homebodies and will roam if given the chance. Foxhounds are extremely active and need one to two hours a day of exercise. Take them on long, meandering walks with lots of sniffing time or take them on a run with you. Foxhounds aren"t suited to living in cramped quarters; they need a large yard or, better yet, an acre or two. Foxhounds love to eat and easily gain weight if their food intake isn"t strictly controlled. Foxhounds can be stubborn and independent, making training a challenge. Obedience training is important, however, to develop a better relationship with your dog and establish your position as leader of the pack. Foxhounds are gentle and tolerant and love children. They enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats if introduced to them at an early age.
When the first European settlers arrived in the American colonies, some of them brought their hounds with them. In the late 1700s, the descendents of these dogs were bred with imported Irish, English, and French hounds. The American breeders were aiming to develop a Foxhound that would be lighter, taller, and faster than his English cousin, with a keener sense of smell, to better suit the game and terrain of their new country. George Washington was among the early American breeders. He kept a pack of American Foxhounds at Mount Vernon and tried to improve his dogs by breeding them to imported British hounds. He also bred them to French foxhounds given to him by his friend the Marquis de Lafayette, a wealthy Frenchman who fought with him in the American War of Independence. These days, there are four types of American Foxhounds: field trial hounds, which are known for their speed and competitive spirit; slow-trailing hounds, which are known for their musical baying and used for hunting foxes on foot; drag hounds, also known as trail hounds, which are raced or hunted using an artificial lure instead of real prey; and pack hounds, used by hunters on horseback in packs of 15 to 20 or more.
Males are 22 inches to 25 inches tall and weigh 45 to 65 pounds; females are 21 inches to 24 inches tall and weigh 40 to 60 pounds.
While they"re mainly sweet and easygoing, American Foxhounds have the independent and stubborn nature that"s common to hounds. They"ve been bred to hunt with very little direction from their human companions, and they don"t necessarily see why they should have to do things your way. Foxhounds who"ve been raised in the company of other dogs, rather than with a human family, can be challenging because they"ve bonded more with their pack than with people. They"ll need more time, attention, and training to help them get used to life as a family dog. Like every dog, Foxhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, dogs, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps a Foxhound puppy grow up to be a friendly, well-rounded dog.
This is typically a healthy breed and isn"t known to have any hereditary illnesses. On rare occasions, an American Foxhound may have the following condition: Thrombocytopathy is caused by poorly functioning platelets and results in abnormal or excessive bleeding from minor bumps or cuts. The treatment is based on the cause and severity of condition.
Bred to be a fast hunter who can run for miles, the American Foxhound needs a substantial amount of exercise. If he"s not going to be a hunting companion, he"ll need daily runs or some other form of exercise to help him burn off his natural energy. He"s best suited to a home with a yard — or better yet, an acre or two; he"s probably too loud for condo or apartment living. Often raised in outdoor kennels with a pack of dogs, the American Foxhound is used to roughing it, and can live outdoors if he"s got a good shelter and another social dog to keep him company. If he"s an only dog, however, he should live indoors with his human pack so he won"t get lonely. Obedience training is highly recommended to help the independent Foxhound view you as leader of the pack. He won"t respond well to punishment-based training, so use treats and praise to reward him for doing as you ask. And "ask" is the operative word. Hounds will flat-out ignore you if you try to boss them around. Keep an old Southern adage in mind when training an American Foxhound: you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of a high-quality dog food a day. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Hounds like to eat. To help prevent obesity, measure your Foxhound"s food before you serve it and give meals twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. You should be able to see a waist when you look down at him. Do the hands-on test periodically to make sure your dog"s in good shape: place your hands over his body, thumbs along the spine and fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, your dog needs more exercise and less food. For more on feeding your American Foxhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
American Foxhounds have a medium-length coat that lies close to the body and has a hard texture, protecting the hound from brush and briars in the field. The coat comes in many colors; as the saying goes, no good hound is a bad color. American Foxhounds are a brush-and-go breed. A once-over with a firm bristle brush once a week removes dirt and distributes the skin oils that keep the coat healthy. You don"t need to bathe your Foxhound regularly — only when you notice a strong doggy smell or he"s gotten into something grimy. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene. Brush your Foxhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and protect your legs from getting scratched when your Foxhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Start getting your Foxhound used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience, filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
American Foxhounds are patient and loving with children, and it"s not unusual to hear of a child learning to walk by holding onto the family Foxhound. That said, as with any breed, you should never leave a dog and a young child alone together. They should always be supervised to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling, by either party. Bred for living in large packs, American Foxhounds are always happy to have the company of other dogs. A bored hound will find ways to entertain himself — destructive ways that you won"t like — so if no one"s home during the day, it"s best if he has at least one canine buddy. American Foxhounds can get along well with cats, rabbits, and other pets if they"re raised with them in the home. Even so, don"t leave them unsupervised with other pets until you"re sure they all get along.
American Foxhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many American Foxhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a American Foxhound rescue organization. Foxhound Rescue Groups

The American Pit Bull Terrier is one of the so-called bully breeds often labeled a pit bull. In fact, "pit bull" isn"t a breed, but a term used to describe the American Pit Bull Terrier, the Bull Terrier, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.Some people say the American Pit Bull Terrier is the same as the American Staffordshire Terrier. Others, just as forcefully, say they"re entirely different breeds.But all experts can agree that the confusion started with a decision by the AKC in the early 1930s to give it a new name, American Staffordshire Terrier, to separate it from its pit-fighting past. The American Pit Bull Terrier has not been recognized by the AKC, while the American Staffordshire Terrier, which is slightly smaller, has been.The bull breeds are often grossly misunderstood. The qualities that make these dogs tenacious players in obedience and agility games also attract highly unscrupulous people looking for strong competitors for their dog fighting rings. The sorry result is that bull breeds, in particular the APBT, have gained a reputation over recent years for being dangerous.Nothing could be further from the truth. But rampant misinformation and fear caused by the actions of a minority of dogs kept by criminally negligent people have provoked legislation against the breed in a number of cities and countries around the world.As the owner of an American Pit Bull Terrier you must be aware that you may be met with anger and hostility by people who are misinformed about your wonderful dog. This is not a breed for everyone, especially those who aren"t willing to invest time in training and socialization and can"t or won"t provide consistent firm guidance.When raised with the proper training and socialization, the American Pit Bull Terrier makes an excellent companion for children. He is loving and gentle with people and often makes a lousy guard dog because of his tail-wagging eagerness to greet the person at the door. American Pit Bull Terriers are devoted and loyal to their family and will, if necessary, defend them to the death.These dogs are extremely intelligent and learn commands and tricks with ease. They have a zest for life and love to be involved in everything going on around them. They maintain a puppyish demeanor well into adulthood, and that vitality makes them a joy to live with. Once you have met and gotten to know this breed you will wonder how you ever lived without one.
American Pit Bull Terriers are not a good choice for people who can give them little or no attention. They must be trained and socialized when young to overcome the breed"s tendencies toward stubbornness and bossiness, which combined with his strength can make him hard to handle if he hasn"t learned you are in charge. Your American Pit Bull Terrier must be kept on leash in public to prevent aggression toward other dogs. It"s not a good idea to let these dogs run loose in dog parks. While they might not start a fight, they"ll never back down from one, and they fight to the finish. American Pit Bulls who aren"t properly socialized as puppies can become aggressive toward other dogs. Breed-specific legislation almost always includes this breed. Be aware of rules in your area as well as neighboring regions if you travel with your dog. American Pit Bull Terriers have a great need to chew, and powerful jaws make quick work of cheap or flimsy toys. Give yours only tough, durable toys that can"t be chewed up and swallowed. American Pit Bull Terriers are best suited to owners who can offer firm, fair training, and gentle consistent discipline.
Bull and terrier breeds were created in early 19th-century England for the popular spectator sports of bull- and bear-baiting. When those sports were deemed inhumane and became illegal 1835, dog-fighting sprung up in its place — and thus was the trait for dog aggression bred into the genetic line.But another part of this breed"s genetic makeup is an unwillingness to bite humans. Handlers reaching into the dog-fighting rings wanted to be able to separate dogs without getting hurt themselves. Quite soon the breed developed a reputation as a strong, protective dog, but one also known for being gentle and family-friendly.When these "bull dogs" accompanied immigrants to America they began new careers as all-around farm dogs. Their jobs included hunting wild game, guarding the property from animal intruders, and providing companionship. In keeping with the "bigger is better" mindset of their new country, the settlers developed a dog larger than it had been in England.In 1898 the UKC, Britain"s equivalent of the AKC, named these bull dogs the American Pit Bull Terrier. The AKC decided to recognize the breed in the early 1930s — but under a new name. Intending to separate it from its pit-fighting past, the AKC named it the American Staffordshire Terrier.Since then the American Staffordshire Terrier has been bred for AKC conformation, or dog shows, while the American Pit Bull Terrier has not been. The results are very slight differences in build and in personality.
Height of 18 to 19 inches for males, 17 to 18 inches for females. Weight ranges from 30 to 85 pounds.
These dogs love people and have no idea that their size is something of a deterrent to being a lap dog. Confident and keenly aware of their surroundings, they are watchdogs in that they may alert you to the presence of strangers, but that"s primarily because they"re eager to greet "their" guests.While their love of people makes them failures as guard dogs, their courage is unmatched and they will defend their family with their lives.Like every dog, American Pit Bull Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
American Pit Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but as with all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all American Pit Bulls Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia (HD): This condition is a malformation of the hip joint ball and socket. It can be extremely painful depending on the severity of the condition. Dogs who are going to be bred should have x-rays of their hips done at 2 years of age to ensure they do not have this condition. Allergies: Allergies are quite common in APBT/AmStaffs. Skin allergies are typically caused by such environmental allergens as fleas, grass, pollen, and dust.They can also be food related, but this is less common. Common food allergens include beef, rice, wheat, and corn. Allergies can cause intense itching and discomfort, which means dogs will dig and chew sometimes till they bleed. This is risky because secondary infections can develop in the damaged tissue. To treat allergies, the cause must be identified and removed from the dog"s environment if possible. A veterinarian can help you with this, as well as let you know which allergy symptoms can be controlled with medication. Hypothyroidism: This is a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues. It usually occurs in middle-aged dogs and can be controlled with daily medication that must continue throughout the dog"s life. Heart Disease: Heart disease affects these dogs in several forms, with aortic stenosis being most common. Aortic stenosis is a congenital heart defect, meaning it"s something the dog is born with. It"s an abnormal narrowing of the connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. Some dogs don"t have any signs or only minor signs, while others may have little energy or even die suddenly. If your veterinarian hears a heart murmur, a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram can confirm the diagnosis.
Expect to spend about an hour a day walking, playing with or otherwise exercising this dog. While they love people, American Pit Bull Terriers are strong for their size and can be stubborn if left to their own devices. Begin obedience training early and continue it throughout the dog"s life. Training is the foundation for a strong relationship with your American Pit Bull Terrier.American Pit Bull Terriers should not be left outside for long because they can"t tolerate the cold well. Even regardless the climate, these dogs do best as housedogs. They form strong attachments to their families and will suffer if left alone for long periods.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.To prevent obesity, measure your dog"s food and give meals at set times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle but not see them. If the ribs are buried beneath rolls of fat, your dog needs to go on a diet.For more on feeding your American Pit Bull Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The short coat is shiny and stiff to the touch, and comes in all colors — red, blue, brown, grey, black and white, and brindle, among them.They require little grooming, and have a coat that"s easy to keep clean with the occasional bath. Brushing with a stiff brush and wiping down with a cloth will maintain the coat"s shine.Brush your dog"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Accustom your American Pit Bull Terrier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
American Pit Bull Terriers love children, and we don"t mean for breakfast. Sturdy, energetic, and tolerant, they are ideal playmates. That said, no dog of any size or breed should ever be left unsupervised with children.When no adult can be there to oversee what"s going on, dogs should be crated or kenneled, especially after they reach sexual maturity, when they may begin to test the possibility of becoming "pack" leader.Don"t allow children to pull on a dog"s ears or tail. Teach them never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away.Because of their dog-fighting heritage, some American Pit Bull Terriers retain a tendency to be aggressive with other dogs, but if they are socialized early and trained to know what behavior is expected of them, that aggression can be minimized or overcome, and many are dog- and cat-friendly. Just to be safe, they should always be supervised in the presence of other pets.

The American Staffordshire Terrier is a loving, loyal, playful dog that loves to spend time with human family members. They are quite muscular for their size, which can make them a handful on walks if they aren"t trained properly. They also have strong jaws, which they will use to chew out of boredom. Many a piece of furniture has been destroyed by an American Staffordshire Terrier that isn"t physically and mentally stimulated enough. However, a confident, firm trainer that can meet the physical demands of the breed without harsh punishment will be rewarded with a calm, obedient dog that is comfortable with nose work, agility exercises, and athletic competitions, as well as just snuggling up on the couch. Although they are used as watchdogs, their natural love of humans makes the American Staffordshire Terrier"s guarding ability more based on intimidation than anything else. Their muscular build and reputation as aggressive dogs act as deterrents from intruders, though that reputation is mostly undeserved. The American Staffordshire Terrier shares much in common with the American Pit Bull Terrier. Both have been used in illegal dog fighting rings, which makes them the targets of Breed Specific Legislation that bans them. But when brought up in a home with love that gives them proper training and socialization, American Staffordshire Terriers are docile, affectionate animals that are very loyal and obedient.
American Staffordshire Terriers have much in common with American Pit Bull Terriers, even though they have been bred separately for more than 50 years. They are considered a "Pit Bull" breed and are targeted by Breed Specific Legislation. Some insurance companies won"t cover households that have this breed. Check your local laws and insurance policy before you adopt one. American Staffordshire Terriers were used in the barbaric sports of bull-baiting and bear-baiting, and they are still used in illegal dog fighting rings to this day. This contributes to their undeserved reputation as aggressive dogs. The breed is very strong for its size and will pull on leashes when not trained properly. They prefer to have a yard with a strong, high fence so they can run around and burn off energy. The short, smooth coat of the American Staffordshire Terrier is fairly easy to groom, and the breed tends to not have a "doggy odor," which means bathing is only necessary as needed. Although they can be good watchdogs through sheer intimidation, American Staffordshire Terriers are generally very friendly towards humans.
The ancestors of the modern American Staffordshire Terrier hail from England and were a mix between Bulldogs and Terrier breeds. Their mixed heritage earned them many names, including Bull-And-Terrier Dog, Pit Bull Terrier, and Half and Half. Eventually, they came to be known as Staffordshire Bull Terriers. These dogs were used by butchers to manage bulls, hunters to bring down wild boars, and farmers to help with farm work and act as ratters and family companions because they were so affectionate to humans. Later, they were used in the barbaric sports of bull-baiting and bear-baiting due to their tenacity, courage, and muscular build. When these blood sports were eventually outlawed, they were used in dog fighting rings, which sadly continues in illegal events to this day. It is because of their misuse by humans that they carry their reputation as an aggressive breed. Around 1850, many of these dogs made their way to America. They started to become known as American Pit Bull Terriers, Pit Bull Terriers, American Bull Terriers, and Yankee Terriers. Around the turn of the 20th century, they were recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as American Pit Bull Terriers. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed as Staffordshire Terrier in 1936. In 1976, the AKC changed the name to American Staffordshire Terrier, as Americans had bred a larger dog than the original Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and these two breeds needed to be distinguished from one another more clearly. Some breeders, however, preferred the name of American Pit Bull Terrier from the UKC and kept it. Today, the American Staffordshire Terrier and the American Pit Bull Terrier still have much in common, though they have been bred separately for more than 50 years. There are very few differences between the breeds, though American Staffordshire Terriers tend to be a bit larger than American Pit Bull Terriers and seem to have more docile personalities. American Staffordshire Terriers are now used as watchdogs, help with police work, and compete in weight pulling and agility competitions, as well as being family pets. They still have a bad reputation as aggressive dogs and are often included in Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) that bans them, and some insurance companies refuse to cover households that have them. Check your local laws and insurance policy before you decide to adopt an American Staffordshire Terrier and contact your legislators if you disagree with BSL.
Male American Staffordshire Terriers average about 17 to 19 inches in height, while females tend to be a bit smaller at an average of 16 to 18 inches in height. The average weight for an American Staffordshire Terrier is between 40 and 60 pounds, though some can weigh more or less.
The American Staffordshire Terrier is celebrated as a family dog that loves to be around humans. American Staffordshire Terriers are never happier than when they"re spending time with their families, whether its during a vigorous play session, a long walk, or just cuddling up on the couch. In fact, although they have a reputation as being guard dogs, they are likely to greet strangers with lots of licks and affection. It is mostly their muscular build and undeserved reputation as aggressive "Pit Bulls" that intimidates intruders and keeps them away. That said, many American Staffordshire Terrier owners claim that dogs of this breed are great judges of character and know people"s intent, and they can make excellent watchdogs for that reason. American Staffordshire Terriers are intense dogs that will pull, chew, dig, and bark if they"re bored. As strong, athletic dogs, they can be difficult to walk, and they"ll pull their walker wherever they go if they"re allowed to. They need a confident, assertive trainer who will be able to handle them on a leash, set boundaries, and give them proper mental and physical stimulation. They also require early socialization with humans and other animals. While the breed is naturally friendly to people, they can be confrontational with other dogs when they aren"t socialized. American Staffordshire Terriers are intelligent, eager to please, and generally take well to training. They enjoy having a job to do, whether that"s acting as a jogging buddy, doing nose work, running agility courses, or performing in other dog sports. A trainer who can meet the physical demands of the American Staffordshire Terrier and keep them busy and under control will have a devoted, affectionate, and obedient companion for life.
The American Staffordshire Terrier is generally a healthy breed, though they are predisposed to a few health problems that you should be on the lookout for. The breed is prone to skin allergies, urinary tract infections, and autoimmune diseases. They may also develop osteoarthritis or spondylosis later in life. Other health problems that American Staffordshire Terriers may develop include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, demodectic mange, cerebellar ataxia, heart disease, and luxating patella.
American Staffordshire Terriers are known to get bad breath, so their teeth should be brushed at least weekly, preferably even more frequently, to prevent bad breath germs from growing. Their nails should be trimmed as needed, which can be difficult as American Staffordshire Terriers tend to not like to have their paws touched. Training them early to be comfortable with touching and grooming will help. Their ears should be checked for wax buildup and debris weekly and cleaned as needed to avoid ear infection or pest infestation. Keep up with regular veterinary checkups and follow your veterinarian"s advice for additional at-home care.
American Staffordshire Terriers should be given a diet formulated for a mid-to-large size dog with moderate energy levels. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your American Staffordshire Terrier and what size portions they require. Their needs will change with age, so be sure to make adjustments from puppyhood to adulthood and old age as recommended.
The short, smooth coat of the American Staffordshire Terrier can come in a variety of colors, including blue, fawn, white, black, and red. They can include a mix of white and other colors or a mix of white and brindle. It is considered a fault by the AKC if more than 80 percent of the coat is white. The stiff, glossy hair of the American Staffordshire Terrier sheds heavily twice a year as the seasons change and sheds minimally the rest of the year. It should be brushed at least weekly, which will help capture some of the shedding fur and keep the coat shiny. Bathing is only necessary as needed, which shouldn"t be more than a few times a year unless dogs get dirty. Generally, this breed doesn"t have much of a "doggy odor" and can go without a bath for some time. Overall, American Staffordshire Terriers" grooming needs are fairly low.
American Staffordshire Terriers are known for being loving family dogs, even with children. That said, they are best suited to homes with kids over the age of six. This breed is very muscular and can play rough, which might result in injuries. Young kids like to poke and prod, so it is especially important to train them on how to handle animals. Even with properly trained dogs of any breed, play time with children should always be supervised. American Staffordshire Terriers are not generally fond of other dogs. They were originally bred to fight, and though many breeders have worked to remove these tendencies over the years, the breed can still be standoffish. Meeting other dogs in public can be a hit-or-miss situation with each individual dog. Additionally, American Staffordshire Terriers may see other pets like cats as prey. Early socialization and growing up with other animals can reduce the American Staffordshire Terrier"s tendencies to not get along well with other pets, but they may be best suited to one pet households.

Although he"s not well known outside the Great Lakes area of the United States, the American Water Spaniel (AWS) has qualities that make him well worth your consideration, especially if you"re outdoorsy and live near the water. The AWS is a medium-size all-around hunting dog and retriever, so he"s chock-full of energy and enthusiasm. Like other hunting dogs he needs plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, and so long as he gets it — whether it"s from retrieving game out in the field or playing fetch with the kids — he"s a well-mannered family companion. Although the AWS is used to hunt all sorts of small game, he specializes in waterfowl, and is a natural swimmer as well as a skilled retriever and hunter. His versatility serves him well in many dog sports and activities such as agility, obedience trials, hunt tests, rally, therapy work, tracking, and search and rescue, as well as conformation. If you"re looking for an active dog who loves to swim and retrieve and can be trained for different sports and activities, the American Water Spaniel could be an ideal fit for you. The American Water Spaniel will be friendly toward people if they have been properly introduced. He makes an excellent watchdog however, and will alert you with a warning bark if he hears any strange noises. This is a rare breed, and very few puppies are born each year. If you"re interested in an AWS, find a reputable breeder who can help you decide if the breed"s a good match for you. And then settle in for a good wait — you may spend several months or even a year or more on a waiting list before a puppy"s available. People who breed these unique dogs want to make sure they go to just the right homes, and they"re able to pick and choose the families who"ll take great care of their puppies.
American Water Spaniels are active dogs and require daily exercise. Give him one to two hours a day of walks, runs, or games of fetch. You can break up exercise periods throughout the day — an hour here, a half hour there. Without it they may express their pent-up energy with recreational barking and excessive chewing. The AWS craves companionship, and if you leave him alone for more than a few hours, he may express his boredom and loneliness in destructive ways. The AWS is best suited for homes where someone"s home during the day. American Water Spaniels can be stubborn and manipulative. You must show them that you mean what you say by establishing rules and being consistent in enforcing them. American Water Spaniels like to roam and may leave your yard or your side to go hunting on their own if they"re not confined by a fence or restrained by a leash. AWS"s may become one-person dogs but will be friendly toward family members. Don"t expect them to fawn over visitors or strangers, though. Harsh treatment can make your AWS timid or stubborn. The breed responds best to a gentle touch and training techniques that use rewards for getting it right, rather than punishment for getting it wrong. Some American Water Spaniels are territorial and aggressive with strange dogs, although they get along with other family dogs and pets. They have a natural tendency for chewing, digging, and jumping, but you can overcome these behaviors with training. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The American Water Spaniel was developed in the Fox and Wolf River valleys of Wisconsin during the mid-1800s. Reliable breeding records date to 1865. The AWS"s ancestors probably include the Irish Water Spaniel, Curly-Coated Retriever, Field Spaniel, and the now-extinct Old English Water Spaniel. Whatever his family background, the AWS we know today was bred to be a versatile hunting buddy. His dense, curly coat helps protect this natural swimmer from cold water as well as from briars in the woods; his small size allows waterfowl hunters to take him in a little boat or canoe; and he will tenderly retrieve grouse, quail, pheasant, and ducks. The AWS sticks close to his human hunting companion rather than ranging far afield. Hunters along the Mississippi flyway and its northern tributaries often used the versatile AWS, taking advantage of the dog"s ability to work in varied terrain from marshes to uplands, his endurance, and his ability to retrieve many birds in a day. But when larger retriever breeds from England became popular, the little brown spaniel began to fall out of favor. Fortunately, he had a fan in Doctor F. J. Pfeifer of New London, Wisconsin, who"s credited with saving the breed from extinction. Pfeifer bred and sold American Water Spaniels, formed a breed club, and helped to develop a breed standard — a written description of how the AWS should look. His efforts paved the way for the United Kennel Club"s recognition of the breed in 1920, the Field Stud Book in 1938, and the American Kennel Club"s recognition of the breed in 1940. One of Pfeifer"s own dogs, "Curly Pfeifer," was the first registered American Water Spaniel. The American Water Spaniel remains rare, with fewer than 3,000 in existence today. This rarity has probably saved the breed from splitting into two groups, one used for dog show competitions, and the other to continue the breed"s traditional job as hunting companion, as seen in some other retriever breeds. He was named the state dog of Wisconsin in 1986.
Males and females are 15 to 18 inches tall. Females tend to be slightly smaller than males, with females weighing 25 to 40 pounds and males weighing 35 to 45 pounds.
The American Water Spaniel is lively, alert, friendly, and obedient, as long as you provide fair, consistent training and leadership. Without it, he can become stubborn and manipulative. Make sure your training methods use rewards rather than punishment, though; when treated harshly the AWS can become sulky or timid. He likes human companionship and may become a barker if he"s home alone and gets bored. This isn"t a dog you can leave alone for hours in the backyard. And although he makes a good family dog, he"s likely to bond most strongly with whoever gives him the most time and attention. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the AWS needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your AWS puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
American Water Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all American Water Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In American Water Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: A degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds of dogs, not just the American Water Spaniel. Growth Hormone-Responsive Dermatitis: Causes skin changes due to a lack of growth hormone (somatropin). This hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland and is necessary for hair growth. Affected animals have varying degrees of hair loss but are otherwise healthy. The mode of inheritance is unknown. The condition is more common in male dogs between 1 and 5 years of age, with hair loss starting at puberty. The hair loss is symmetrical over dog"s body, and the skin is markedly darker in color due to increased pigmentation. Without treatment, hairlessness and hyper pigmentation will eventually spread over the body except for the head and feet. It can be treated with growth hormone, but this is an expensive treatment and difficult to obtain. Neutering may resolve the condition in male dogs. Pattern Baldness (Saddle Alopecia): This condition causes a gradual, symmetric thinning and loss of hair (alopecia) that usually begins by 6 to 9 months of age and progresses until affected areas are completely bald. Saddle alopecia causes hair loss underneath the neck, on the back of the thighs, and on the tail. Method of inheritance is not known. There is no treatment to cover the hair loss. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. They eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract. Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is an abnormal development of the retina resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. It"s most commonly seen as a hereditary disease, but a number of environmental factors including trauma can also cause it. There is no known treatment for Retinal Dysplasia but many dogs with it live full lives, their other senses compensating for the visual impairment. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. Contact allergies are also treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder that affects many breeds. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Epilepsy: A disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of hormone produced from the thyroid gland, which is found in the neck. The mild symptoms of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs of this disease are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires a lifetime of treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life.
If he gets lots of exercise and playtime, the American Water Spaniel can do well in smaller living situations such as an apartment or condominium, but he"s a country dog at heart, and is happiest when he"s got plenty of open space to run off his natural energy. Smart and trainable, the AWS responds best to short, motivational training sessions. Avoid heavy-handed techniques that use punishments for getting it wrong instead of rewards for getting it right — they could make him sulky or withdrawn. And train him yourself rather than sending him off to be tutored by a stranger. He"ll work much better for someone he knows and loves. He may chew when his people aren"t home, so crate training is a must to keep your possessions safe and your AWS out of the doghouse.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your AWS in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your AWS, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
This is what"s known as a double-coated dog. A dense undercoat protects the American Water Spaniel against weather, water, and scratchy underbrush. The outer coat may have uniform waves — called a marcel coat — or tight curls. The amount of curl or wave can vary from one area of the dog"s body to another. The forehead is covered with short, smooth hair, and moderate feathering adorns the tail and legs. An AWS coat can be solid liver, brown, or dark chocolate, and will occasionally have a small amount of white on the toes or chest. Some hunters clip the coat to make it easier to remove burrs. Family dogs can be left au naturel, or you may want to trim the coat or shave the ears to neaten the dog"s look. The coat is naturally oily to help with water resistance, so be prepared for oily spots on your wall or furniture if the dog rubs up against them. Brush the coat weekly to keep it in good shape. Water Spaniels shed in the spring, but frequent brushing will help keep too much loose hair from piling up on your carpets and furniture. Frequent baths will remove the coat"s natural oils and diminish its ability to repel water and keep the dog warm, so bathe him only when he"s dirty or smelly and really needs it. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your AWS"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your AWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your AWS"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your AWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your AWS to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The American Water Spaniel is gentle with children. Nonetheless, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Some American Water Spaniels are territorial and aggressive with strange dogs, but they generally get along well with family dogs and cats.

The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a considered a livestock protector or guardian dog. As such, he was developed to live with the flock and adopt it as his own. He is a rugged, self-confident guardian who knows how much protection or intimidation is necessary in any situation. The Anatolian has been working independently for centuries, making decisions regarding threats to his property. As a puppy, he adopts whomever he lives with, be it a family or a herd of sheep; as he grows, he takes on the protector gig. It doesn"t matter to the Anatolian whether his "flock" is human or animal — he is extremely protective and possessive. And he backs up his guardian nature with presence. The Anatolian is a large dog, weighing as much as 150 pounds. He has a short, fawn coat and a black mask. He appears intimidating, and if necessary he is — though he"s calm and friendly with his family. Not surprisingly for a guard dog, the Anatolian Shepherd is suspicious of strangers and reserved with those outside his "flock." He takes his job seriously — this dog is no clown — and when his owner isn"t home, he is unlikely to allow even friends or extended family members whom he"s met before to come onto his property. At the same time, the Anatolian is a very intelligent, loyal, steady working dog. He"s highly trainable, though he"s likely to consider whether or not he will choose to obey a command, due to his independent nature. He needs an owner who is strong, kind, and consistent as a pack leader. This breed is probably not a good choice as a family pet if you have very young children. Because he"s so large, he could accidentally injure a small child, especially when he"s a clumsy, growing puppy (the phrase "bull in a china shop" applies). Additionally, the Anatolian typically does not respect children as pack leaders, and he could decide to protect his children from visiting playmates if they"re roughhousing and the dog misinterprets the activity. Generally, the Anatolian is tolerant of older children and is good with them. To him they are, of course, part of the flock that needs guarding, along with the rest of the family. The Anatolian Shepherd is not the perfect breed for everyone. He can be a fine and loyal companion if you and your family understand his unique qualities and requirements and are ready to take on the responsibility of owning a very large and protective dog. If you need a dog to protect a flock or herd, find a breeder who breeds successful livestock guardians: you"ll have a better outcome if the puppy or adult you purchase already has successful working dogs in his bloodline. When looking for a family companion, focus on proper breed temperament. Find a good breeder with experience with this dog"s character, and you"ll be able to look forward to many years of companionship with a loyal, protective guardian for your family.
It is critical that the Anatolian Shepherd receive proper socialization and training so that he can learn what is normal and what is a threat. Untrained and unsocialized Anatolian Shepherds can become overprotective, aggressive, and uncontrollable. Anatolian Shepherds are independent and less eager to please than other breeds. They won"t not necessarily wait for instructions but will act if they think their "flock" is threatened. Secure fencing is an abolute must. Some Anatolians are champion diggers. As guardians of their territory, some can be barkers, especially at night. Some Anatolians can be dog-aggressive. They shed profusely, especially in the spring. Expect a challenge for leadership at some point with the Anatolian Shepherd. Owners must be willing to exercise pack authority consistently and kindly. Because they are so large, expect high costs for boarding, medications, and food purchases; you"ll also need a large vehicle for them. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are sensitive to anesthesia. Discuss this with your veterinarian before any surgical procedures. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is named for his homeland of Anatolia in the central part of Turkey, where he is still a point of pride (and has even been honored on a national postage stamp). It"s thought that the working ancestors of the breed date back 6,000 years. Wandering tribes from central Asia probably brought the first mastiff-type dogs into the area that is now Turkey, and sight hound breeds from southern regions contributed to the Anatolian"s agility, long legs, and aloof character. Due to the climate and terrain of the area, the local population developed a nomadic way of life, dependent on flocks of sheep and goats. The protection of those flocks, and of the shepherds themselves, was the job of the large dogs who traveled with them. The dogs became known as coban kopegi, Turkish for "shepherd dog." The dogs stayed with the animals night and day, and they had to be swift enough to move quickly from one end of a widely scattered flock to the other. They also had to be large and strong enough to stand up to predators. Severe culling and breeding of only the best workers resulted in a dog with a uniform type, stable temperament, and excellent working ability. Dogs were often not fed once they were past puppyhood. They lived by killing gophers and other small animals, though never injuring their flock. They were fitted with iron collars with long spikes to protect their throats from assailants. You can still find working dogs wearing these collars in Turkey today. Anatolian Shepherds got their most enthusiastic introduction in the U.S. in the 1970s, although prior to that the Turkish government had given Anatolians to the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a gift, for experimental work as guardians of flocks. But in 1970, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog Club of America was formed at the urging of Robert Ballard, a U.S. naval officer who had become fascinated by the dogs while in Turkey, and who began to breed them once back in California. The breed entered the American Kennel Club Miscellaneous Class in 1996. It moved to the Working Group in August 1998.
Males stand 29 inches tall and weigh 110 to 150 pounds. Females stand 27 inches tall and weigh 80 to 120 pounds.
The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is highly intelligent, independent, and dominant. He thinks for himself — a necessary characteristic for a livestock guardian. He"s very protective of his family and flock, and he considers himself to be constantly on duty. Though protective, the Anatolian Shepherd is calm, friendly, and affectionate with his immediate family. He is not friendly with strangers and is very reserved with those outside his family, even if they"re friends or relatives of yours. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Anatolian Shepherd needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Anatolian Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Anatolian Shepherds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Anatolian Shepherds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Anatolian Shepherds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Demodectic Mange: Also called demodicosis, this malady is caused by the demodex mite. The mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother can pass this mite to her pups, which usually happens in their first few days of life. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems. If your dog has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, it can develop demodectic mange. This disorder can be localized, occurring as patches of red, scaly, skin with hair loss on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. The generalized form covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. In either case, you should take your dog to the vet for a checkup and treatment. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs who develop generalized demodectic mange, because it carries a genetic link. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, which usually affects the lower eyelids of both eyes. It is irritating and causes impairment of vision. It generally occurs before a dog turns a year old, but treatment should be held off until the dog reaches adulthood. Treatment consists of multiple surgeries performed over time so that the dog isn"t at risk for ectropion, which is a rolling out of the eyelid.
The Anatolian Shepherd is a hardy dog and can adapt to living outdoors, indoors, or both. He does not do well living in a kennel or at the end of a chain, however. He should be kept in a securely fenced yard — a fence at least six feet tall is required for this big breed — not only for his protection but also for the protection of dogs or people who might inadvertently enter his turf, which he will defend with all his might. Because he is naturally wary of new people, animals, and situations, the Anatolian Shepherd must be socialized right from puppyhood. Obedience training and consistent leadership are also essential, because the Anatolian is so strong-willed. This dog has his own ideas, and he won"t cater to his owner"s every whim. The Anatolian Shepherd will guard and protect without any protection training; in fact, attack training is not recommended for this breed. His protective nature grows as he matures; by the time he"s about 18 months old, he usually voluntarily takes on the role of guardian.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Anatolian Shepherd in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Anatolian Shepherd, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Anatolian Shepherd Dog"s coat is short (about an inch long) with a thick undercoat. Sometimes there is feathering on the ears, legs, and tail. His coat comes in many colors, including pinto, white, and brindle, but fawn with a black mask is common. The Anatolian Shepherd is naturally clean, so he" no big handful in the grooming department. The breed"s short coat requires minimal brushing, but you can expect profuse shedding several times year. Extra brushing during those times helps remove dead hair. Minimal bathing, three to four times a year, is all that"s needed. Brush your Anatolian Shepherd"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Anatolian Shepherd to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Anatolian Shepherd is loving with his family, including the children, with whom he"s calm and protective. But because of his large size, he"s probably better suited to families with older children. He"s unlikely to respect young children as leaders, so all interactions between the Anatolian and children should be supervised by responsible adults. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The best chance of the Anatolian Shepherd accepting other dogs and pets is to raise him with them from puppyhood. As he grows, he"ll naturally accept them as part of his "flock."
Anatolian Shepherds are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Anatolian Shepherds in need of adoption and/or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club, and they can point you toward a Anatolian Shepherd rescue organization.

Also known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog, this is the rarest of the four ancient Swiss mountain dog breeds. He got his start as an all-around farm dog — herding livestock, pulling carts, and guarding the farm — in the Appenzell region of Switzerland. Today the Appenzeller"s known for being a versatile working and family dog who"s smart, cheerful, self-assured, reliable, and fearless. His slight wariness around strangers and tendency to bark makes him a good watchdog, but he needs lots of early socialization so he doesn"t become overly suspicious. And because of his barkiness, he"s not the best dog if you have nearby neighbors. He"s a great friend of children, but may nip at their heels as if they were livestock to be herded; younger Appenzellers are big and exuberant enough to accidentally knock over small kids. Because he"s got a strong work ethic and lots of energy, this breed isn"t suited to an inactive lifestyle. Provide him with training and a job or dog sport he can do, or he"ll be an unhappy camper. Like other breeds that need lots of exercise and stimulation, he can grow bored and destructive if he doesn"t get it. He excels at agility, herding, and obedience trials. At home, teach your Appenzeller to pull a cart with your gardening supplies.

You might be familiar with this breed by one of his other common names: Australian Heeler, Blue Heeler, Queensland Heeler, or Halls Heeler. Officially, however, he"s the Australian Cattle Dog; the "heeler" moniker comes from the fact that the dogs were bred to herd cattle by nipping at their heels. The Australian Cattle Dog is a high-energy working dog. He is not a couch potato — we repeat: he is not a couch potato. He wants to be active and busy most of the time. His energy must be directed, or he"ll become bored and will resort to entertaining himself, usually by doing something you consider naughty, like digging in the trash or digging up your flower garden. The Australian Cattle Dog is also highly devoted to his owner and family. He usually attaches himself closely to one person and bonds less closely with others. He"s often called a "Velcro" dog because he attaches so firmly; he likes to be in close physical contact with his chosen person all the time. Because the Australian Cattle Dog was bred to herd, and herd with force, by biting, he is a mouthy dog. His instinct is to nip cattle, children, pets, cars, anything that moves. He has a strong tendency to bite, even in play. This tendency must be properly directed with socialization and training when he"s a puppy, or it can turn into dangerous behavior. Another part of the breed"s instinct is his strong prey drive. He"s fascinated by squirrels, cats, and other small animals. If the Australian Cattle Dog is raised from puppyhood with other pets, including cats, he can be trusted to live peacefully with them in his home. He"s likely to consider those outside his household to be fair game, though. The Australian Cattle Dog is generally friendly, but he is protective of his family and home turf, and he tends to be wary of strangers. There is a toughness about the Australian Cattle Dog — he had to be tough to handle the high temperatures, rough terrain, and long distances involved in his job on ranches — that makes him both highly tolerant of pain and intensely focused. He"ll keep working even when he"s injured. Owners must pay careful attention to this breed to make sure he stops working or competing if he gets hurt.
The Australian Cattle Dog is extremely active, both physically and mentally. He needs a regular job or activity to keep him busy, tired, and out of trouble. Nipping and biting is the Australian Cattle Dog"s natural instinct. Proper training, socialization, and supervision help minimize this potentially dangerous characteristic. The Australian Cattle Dog is a "shadow" dog; intensely devoted to his owner, he does not want to be separated from him or her. The best way to help the Australian Cattle Dog get along with children and other pets is to raise him with them from a young age. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Australian Cattle Dog was bred by 19th-century Australian settlers to herd cattle on large ranches. This breed was instrumental in helping ranchers expand the Australian beef industry by quietly but aggressively herding the sometimes uncontrollable, almost wild cattle with nips and bites. Today"s Australian Cattle Dog is the result of many breedings and cross-breedings. Ranchers sought a hardy dog who could handle the harsh climate and working conditions in Australia. Dogs initially brought from England weren"t up to the job, so they were bred to the native Dingo. Countless breedings by many different ranchers finally resulted in what"s believed to be the ancestors of the present-day Australian Cattle Dog. Blue-colored dogs proved to be the most popular among ranch owners and drovers, and they became known as Blue Heelers. They were especially popular in cattle runs in Queensland, where they were given the name Queensland Heelers or Queensland Blue Heelers. In 1893, Robert Kaleski took up breeding Blue Heelers, and he started showing them in 1897. Kaleski drew up a standard, basing the Cattle Dog on the Dingo, believing that this was the type naturally suited to the Australian outback. (Today"s Australian Cattle Dog does look much like the Dingo, except for color.) The Kennel Club of New South Wales approved this standard in 1903. The breed was first known as the Australian Heeler, then later as the Australian Cattle Dog, which is the name now accepted as official throughout Australia and elsewhere. However, some people still call them Blue Heelers or Queensland Heelers. After a period in the Miscellaneous Class, the Australian Cattle Dog was accepted for registration by the American Kennel Club May 1980. He became eligible for show in the Working Group as of September 1980. The breed was transferred to the Herding Group in January 1983.
Males stand 18 to 20 inches tall, and females stand 17 to 19 inches tall. Weight ranges from 30 to 50 pounds.
The Australian Cattle Dog is an extremely active dog who needs constant mental and physical activity. If he"s bored or lonely, he can be destructive. He"s apt to chew and tear up items he shouldn"t. If you choose to live with an Australian Cattle Dog, be prepared to keep him busy — and tired. If he"s tired, he"s less likely to get himself into trouble. The Australian Cattle Dog is protective of what he considers his territory, and he"ll defend it. He"s also reserved (not necessarily unfriendly) with strangers. But he"s devoted to his owner and family. Once he bonds, he likes to go wherever his owner goes; in fact, punishment to the Australian Cattle Dog is physical separation from those he loves. He"s smart, but at times he can be willful and stubborn. Consistent, positive training helps control his independent streak. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Australian Cattle Dog needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Australian Cattle Dog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Australian Cattle Dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Australian Cattle Dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Australian Cattle Dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Deafness: This is an inherited condition in the Australian Cattle Dog, but it can be tested for while the puppies are very young. Deaf dogs should not be bred. Research indicates that deafness is color-linked; genes that cause pups to be born white, or with white hairs in the coat that cause a roaning pattern, are linked to deafness. Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing is useful for determining hearing problems, but it"s only a tool, not a cure.
The hardworking Australian Cattle dog is best suited to an environment where he gets plenty of physical and mental stimulation. He"s not well suited to living in an apartment or being left alone for long periods of time. He"s destructive when bored, and he tends to chew — a lot. He needs a home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch. If you are considering an Australian Cattle Dog, make sure you can provide him a proper outlet for his natural energy and bright mind. Because he was bred to herd and chase, that"s exactly what he will do: herd and chase just about anything, including cars. If you"re not a sheep or cattle farmer, consider canine sports. This dog loves the activity and challenges associated with sports. The Australian Cattle Dog needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid if he"s not properly socialized when young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Australian Cattle Dog grows up to be a well-rounded dog. His propensity to mouth, chew, nip, and bite must be handled carefully. He must be taught not to put his mouth on people, only on appropriate chew items, such as sturdy toys.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Australian Cattle Dog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Australian Cattle Dog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Australian Cattle Dog"s weather-resistant outer coat is short and straight; he has a dense undercoat. The typical Australian Cattle Dog doesn"t shed year-round, but instead he "blows" his coat once or twice a year (think of a snowstorm). In just a few weeks, the undercoat sheds in clumps. The Australian Cattle Dog"s coloring is blue or red speckle. Blue or blue-mottled includes black, blue, or tan markings on the head; partially tan on the forelegs, chest, and throat; and tan on the jaw and hind legs. Sometimes the undercoat is tan with a blue outer coat. Red speckle means red all over, including the undercoat, and sometimes including dark red markings on the head. The Australian Cattle Dog doesn"t require much primping, but some grooming is necessary to keep him clean and healthy. Brush him periodically, say four times a month, to distribute oils and remove dirt. When he sheds, though, brush frequently to remove the dead hair. Bathe him as needed — basically when he"s really dirty or smells bad. Brush your Australian Cattle Dog"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Australian Cattle Dog to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Australian Cattle Dog is good family dog, but he does best with children if he"s raised with them and accepts them early on as members of his household. In such cases, he"s very playful and protective. The breed"s tendency to be mouthy — even to nip and bite — can be a problem with kids, however. He may want to herd them with sharp nips, or bite when youngsters play too roughly. An adult Australian Cattle Dog who has had little exposure to children will not know how to treat them and may be too rough. Some dogs are suspicious of children; because they don"t act like adults, dogs sometimes perceive them as threatening. Most problems can be solved by carefully socializing the Australian Cattle Dog puppy to children, and by teaching him bite inhibition. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Australian Cattle Dog gets along with other dogs in his household, especially if he"s been raised with them from puppyhood. However, because he is so devoted to one person in a family, there can be jealousy or squabbles between the Australian Cattle Dog and other dogs. Now, about cats and other small animals that the Australian Cattle Dog usually thinks of as prey: if he is raised with a cat or other animal from the time he"s a puppy, he"ll probably consider it a member of his houseshold and leave it alone. If not, he"s likely to chase, catch, and even kill.
Australian Cattle Dogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Australian Cattle Dogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Australian Cattle Dog rescue.

Watching an Australian Shepherd round up a flock of sheep is a beautiful sight. With sure and athletic movement, he directs the flock using nips, barks, and "eye," a penetrating stare that clearly says, "I"m in charge."Intelligent, hard working, and versatile, the Aussie is a no-nonsense dog who thrives in a home where his brains and energy are put to good use. You don"t have to keep a flock of sheep if you live with an Aussie — although it doesn"t hurt — but you do have to keep him busy. He"s a high-energy dog who doesn"t know the meaning of couch potato and wouldn"t approve of it if he did.Because he"s got energy to burn, he needs plenty of exercise — a walk around the neighborhood won"t cut it — and at least a small yard to help him work out his ya-yas. Lacking a job to do, he becomes bored, destructive, and loud. Or he might invent his own job: herding the kids, either yours or the neighbors"; chasing cars or other animals; or taking your house apart. If you don"t have the time or energy to train and exercise the Aussie on a daily basis, he"s not the breed for you.But if you"re interested in competitive dog sports, the Aussie"s the one. This agile, medium-size dog with the docked or naturally bobbed tail is a top contender in all levels of obedience, agility, flyball, and herding tests. He"s also successful in such canine careers as guide dog, hearing dog, assistance dog, police dog, and search and rescue work.You can even teach an Aussie to help you with chores around the house, such as picking up dirty laundry off the floor and bringing it to you. You"ll probably have to fold clean laundry yourself, though.The Aussie"s a real looker who stands out from the crowd thanks to his attractive medium-length coat and dark brown, yellow, blue, green, or amber eyes.His heritage as a working dog makes him a loyal companion who can be protective of home and family and aloof with strangers. He gets along with kids, although he"ll probably try to "herd" them unless you teach him not to.The Aussie makes life an adventure. He"ll work and play from sunrise to sunset and win your heart with his loyal and loving personality. This versatile breed is a wonderful working dog and a terrific family companion — but only if that family is an active one.
Australian Shepherds need roughly 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day, preferably with high-energy activities like playing Frisbee. They need a job to do as well, such as daily obedience training or competing in herding and agility trials. Australian Shepherds can be very destructive and bark for long periods if they"re not getting the exercise and mental stimulation they need. Aussies will alert bark to warn you if they see or hear something suspicious, and will protect their family and home with a surprising fierceness. Although Australian Shepherds have the reputation for needing wide-open space, they do just fine in cities if they get enough stimulation and exercise. They"re not good apartment dogs, though. You"ll want at least a small yard to help them get out some of their high energy. This herding dog"s pushiness with livestock can carry over into the home and, with a timid or inexperienced owner, he may assume the dominant role in the family. The breed needs a firm and confident owner — Aussies probably aren"t a good choice if you"ve never had a dog before. Australian Shepherds are average shedders, and their coat needs regular maintenance, including weekly brushing to keep it clean and prevent matting, and possibly trimming to keep it looking tidy. Aussies enjoy the company of their family and prefer to stick close to their human pack. They don"t do well stuck in the backyard by themselves for long periods. Aussies are by nature standoffish with people they don"t know, and unless they have regular exposure to lots of different people — ideally beginning in puppyhood — they can become fearful of strangers. This may lead to biting out of fear and aggression. Give your Aussie lots of contact with friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers to help him polish his social skills. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Despite his name, this is an American-born breed. The Australian Shepherd was originally developed to herd livestock for ranchers and farmers in the western U.S., and some modern-day Aussies still hold that job.There are many theories on which breeds were used to create the Australian Shepherd. It"s likely that the Aussie"s ancestors include collie and shepherd-type dogs that were imported with shipments of sheep from Australia during the 1840s — hence the name. Breeders strove to enhance their herding ability and create a dog who was versatile, hard working, and intelligent.The breed enjoyed a popularity boom in the post-World War II years that went hand-in-hand with a renewed interest in Western-style horseback riding. Crowds at rodeos or horse shows, and audiences of western movies or TV shows, were wowed by the athletic dogs they saw working alongside the cowboys. Despite the popular interest, the breed wasn"t recognized by the American Kennel Club until 1993.Today, the Australian Shepherd remains the same eye-catching, energetic, clever dog that proved so useful to ranchers and farmers in the old West. He"s loved by many and enjoys his life as a family companion, protector, and herding dog.
Slightly longer than he is tall, the Australian Shepherd stands 20 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder for males, 18 to 21 inches for females. On average, males weigh between 50 and 65 pounds, females 40 to 55 pounds.You may see advertisements for dogs called teacup, toy, or miniature Australian Shepherds. Australian Shepherd breeders don"t recognize these dogs as true Australian Shepherds. The breed is meant to be a functional working dog capable of herding tough stock for miles in rough country or snowdrifts, and it has no smaller size varieties.
Bred to be pushy with livestock, Australian Shepherds can and will take the dominant role in the home if you don"t give them firm and confident leadership. This makes them a poor choice for first-time or timid owners.Like many herding dogs, Australian Shepherds are by nature loyal to their family but standoffish with strangers. They need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young.Socialization helps ensure that your Aussie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Aussies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Aussies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Aussies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain. Epilepsy: The Australian Shepherd can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder. Deafness: Deafness is fairly common in this breed and can pose many challenges. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Living with and training a deaf dog requires patience and time, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier. If your Aussie is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for the animal. Regardless of your decision, it is best to notify the breeder. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable Aussie breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA): Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and is diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. There is no treatment for CEA, but as noted above, blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies. Persistent Pupillary Membranes (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Drug Sensitivity: Sensitivity to certain drugs is commonly seen in herding breeds, including Australian Shepherds and Collies. It is caused by a mutation of the Multidrug Resistance Gene (MDR1), which produces a protein called P-glycoprotein. This protein works as a pump to remove toxic substances from the body to prevent the harmful effects of the toxins. In dogs who show Drug Sensitivity, that gene does not function, resulting in toxicity. Dogs with this mutated gene can be sensitive to Ivermectin, a medicine commonly used in anti-parasitic products such as heartworm preventives, as well as other drugs, including chemotherapy drugs. Signs of this sensitivity range from tremors, depression, seizures, incoordination, hypersalivation, coma, and even death. There is no known treatment but there is a new genetic test that can identify dogs with this nonfunctioning gene. All Australian Shepherds should be screened. Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically. Nasal Solar Dermatitis: Also known as Collie-nose, this condition generally occurs in dogs who have little or no pigment in their nose and is not restricted to Collies. Dogs who are super-sensitive to sunlight develop lesions on the nose and occasionally around the eyelids, ranging from light pink lesions to ulcerating lesions. The condition may be difficult to diagnose at first because several other diseases can cause the same lesions. If your Aussie is diagnosed with Collie nose, keep him out of direct sunlight, and apply doggie sunscreen when he goes outside. The most effective way to manage the condition is to tattoo the dog"s nose black so the ink serves as a shield against sunlight. Detached Retina: An injury to the face can cause the retina to become detached from its underlying supportive tissues. A detached retina can lead to visual impairment or even blindness. There is no treatment for a detached retina, but many dogs live full lives with visual impairments.
If you"ve got a yard, make sure you"ve also got a secure fence that your Aussie can"t dig under or jump over. Underground electronic fencing won"t work for this breed: Your Aussie"s desire to go out and herd something will overcome any concern he might have about getting a mild shock. For the same reason, walk him on leash unless you"re willing to train him to resist his urges.Your Aussie needs a half hour to an hour of stimulating activity every day, such as a run, a Frisbee game, or obedience or agility exercises. When you"re not playing with your dog, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied.Puppies don"t need as much hard exercise as adults, and in fact, you shouldn"t let them run them on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they"re at least a year old. It could stress their still developing skeletal system and cause future joint problems.The Aussie habit of nipping and chasing is excellent for herding sheep but bad manners when it"s applied to humans and other pets. Obedience class can help you curb your Aussie"s herding behavior, and they help satisfy his need for mental stimulation and work, too.Aussies respond well to training methods that use positive reinforcement — rewards such as praise, play, and food — and are usually happy to take commands from their trainer. They just want to know who"s in charge so they can do a good job for them.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Aussie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Aussie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Australian Shepherd has a medium-length water-resistant coat to keep him comfortable in rain and snow. Aussies in cold climates have a heavier undercoat than those who live in sunnier areas.Straight or wavy hair covers the body, with short, smooth hair on the head and ears, the front of the forelegs, and below the heels (known as the hocks in dog terms). Moderate feathering, or a longer fringe of hair, covers the back of the forelegs and the britches — the pantaloon-like fur on the upper part of the hind legs. There"s long, profuse hair — which is especially thick and full in males — on the neck and chest.Australian Shepherds come in several colors: blue merle, red merle, red, tri-color (white, black, and tan), and black. A merle coat has a patchwork of dark blotches against a lighter background, so a blue merle dog has black patches on gray and a red merle dog has red patches on beige. Merles tend to become darker with age.If you"re wondering whether the Australian Shepherd sheds, the answer is yes. The breed sheds year-round, but more heavily during spring as he loses his winter coat.Brush the Aussie"s coat weekly, perhaps more often during shedding season, to prevent matting. Before you start brushing, spritz the coat with a dog hair conditioner diluted with water to detangle. Then, using a slicker brush, stroke in the direction the hair grows, being sure to get all the way down to the skin — don"t just run it over the top of the coat. An undercoat rake is also handy for removing excess hair. Mats are common behind the ears, and you may need to work through them with a stripping comb. You can find any of these grooming tools in a good pet supply store.If you keep him brushed, your Aussie should need a bath only when he"s dirty, which probably won"t be more than a few times a year. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his skin and coat.Grooming sessions are a good time to check your dog"s overall condition. Before you start brushing, check your dog for sores, rashes, dry skin, or signs of infection such as inflammation or tenderness. Check eyes for goopy discharge and ears for foreign objects such as burrs or foxtails. The coat should look shiny, not dull. A dull coat could indicate a need for a better diet or more frequent grooming.Trim nails on a regular basis to prevent painful splintering. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long.You may also want to keep your Aussie looking tidy by trimming the hair on and around the ears, on the feet and between the toes, and around the tail area. If you"re uncomfortable handling anything but the grooming basics, try a professional groomer.
Australian Shepherds are herding dogs and many consider kids part of their "flock," so you"ll need to teach your Aussie that chasing and nipping at kids to herd them isn"t allowed. Once they learn this lesson, Aussies make wonderful companions for families with kids.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They can get along with other pets, too, although they may try to herd them. This may not go over too well, especially with cats. Keep an eye on your Aussie when other pets are around until he learns that they"re not members of his flock.
Aussies are often adopted without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Aussies in need of adoption and or fostering. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Aussie rescue. Aussie Rescue and Placement Helpline, Inc.

The Australian Terrier, called an "Aussie" by his admirers (although he"s not to be confused with an Australian Shepherd), is a small terrier with upright ears and a rough, shaggy coat. He is the littlest of the working terriers, but don"t let his size fool you. He"s definitely a lot of dog in a tiny package, with a typical terrier slant on life: tenacious, independent, hardworking, and lively. With a spirited, mischievous personality, the Aussie jumps into life with attitude. But he"s usually strongly attached to his family — so strongly attached that he"ll often match his mood to yours. If you"ve got the blues, he is calm and quiet. If you"re happy and excited, he turns frisky and playful. Mostly, the Aussie is upbeat, active, and silly, clowning around and entertaining his owners. He has an affinity for the young, the elderly, and the disabled. He makes an excellent playmate for a child, although adults should supervise interactions with very young children: Australian Terriers are not snappy or aggressive, but they do have limits on the handling and roughhousing they will tolerate. He may be small, but the Australian Terrier has the confidence of a large breed. He is a wonderful watchdog and will bark to alert his owners of the approach of anyone or anything new and different. Since they"re so intelligent, Australian Terriers will readily learn whatever you"re teaching (so be sure you don"t inadvertently teach your Aussie pup that it"s okay to jump up on you or chase the cat — or he"ll keep up the behavior throughout his adulthood as well). Repetitive training is a bore for these bundles of energy, so lessons must be fun and increasingly challenging. Also, the independent Aussie likes to think the schooling is all his idea. Positive, reward-based training works wonders. Since the breed was developed as a working terrier, the Aussie instinct to chase and kill small animals — including squirrels, rabbits, mice, and cats — is strong. A securely fenced yard is essential, as is leash training. If you have rodents or other small pets, you need to introduce your Aussie to them when he"s a young puppy, and teach him from the start that they are off limits. This can be very difficult — in truth, the best strategy is to never allow the Aussie to gain access to them. He can live with cats if he grows up with them and is taught to leave them alone, but he"s likely to consider all felines outside your household to be fair game. If you like a pristine lawn or showplace garden, an Australian Terrier may not be the breed for you. Like all terriers, he loves to dig — it"s in his breeding — and if left unsupervised for too long, he"ll decide that tearing up the lawn is an ideal way to amuse himself. Even though he stands a mere 10 inches tall and weighs about 14 pounds, this is one confident breed. The spunky Aussie will challenge other dogs, including those much bigger than he is. He can be aggressive and bossy to other dogs in his household.
The Aussie is all terrier, and not everyone finds his favorite hobbies endearing: he loves to bark, dig, and chase. Bossy is the Aussie"s middle name. He wants to be the dominant dog in a multidog household (males can be cranky with other male dogs). In fact, he"ll happily take over the role of pack leader among people, too — so be sure to establish yourself as the boss before he does. Early training and socialization are musts to keep this dog happy and well liked by family and friends, both human and animal. The Aussie"s personality is active and lively. If you prefer a dog with a more subdued nature, look at other breeds first. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
The Australian Terrier is believed to be descended from a dog known as the Rough-Coated Terrier, a relative of the old Scotch dog of Great Britain. Breed researchers have some consensus of opinion that this Terrier was crossed with other British Terriers who were brought to Australia, including the precursor of the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, the Skye, the Yorkshire, and the Black and Tan Terrier. The result was the tough and courageous Aussie. Because early European settlers in Australia faced harsh conditions, they needed a hardy, fearless dog that could work in all kinds of weather. Aussies were bred to control and exterminate rats and snakes on the waterfront, in gold mines, and on sheep stations in the outback. They were also used as watchdogs, shepherds, and companions to the people living in these stressful outposts. The Australian Terrier is the first native breed to be recognized and shown in Australia. He was first shown as the Australian Rough-Coated Terrier in 1868 in Melbourne, and he was officially renamed the Australian Terrier in 1897. The Aussie was brought to England by members of the foreign service and the British aristocracy. The breed was recognized by the Kennel Club in England in 1933. Starting in the late 1940s, servicemen and other travelers brought the Aussie to the United States, where he eventually debuted at the Westminister Kennel Club show in 1957. Nell Fox of Pleasant Pastures Kennels, the author of Australian Terrier (THF Publications, 1997) helped bring recognition to the breed in this country. Fox, a native of New Zealand, had been familiar with the Aussie in her youth and imported some of the first Australian Terriers to arrive in the U.S. In 1960, the Australian Terrier became the 114th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club, the first new terrier breed in 21 years. The Australian Terrier Club of America formed in 1957 and became a member club of the AKC in 1977.
Both males and females stand 10 to 11 inches tall and weigh 14 to 16 pounds.
The Aussie is a fun-loving, upbeat dog who makes a great companion for any individual or family who wants to share his energetic lifestyle. Devoted to his owners, he"s happiest when he"s part of daily family life. He likes to be in the house, playing with the kids, following you room to room, or shouldering his way to the front door when you greet a friend. He is clever and should be easy to train — as long as you keep him busy and never, ever bore him.
Australian Terriers are generally healthy but, like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Legg-perthes causes a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone, until the bone eventually dies off, collapses, and becomes deformed. The result is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It"s unclear what causes legg-perthes, but it may be inherited or related to injury. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Dogs generally do well after the surgery, and many suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes. Diabetes mellitus prevents the body from regulating blood sugar levels properly. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate for the lack of glucose reaching the body"s cells — but he will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Allergies. Aussies can be prone to allergies (though they are common to dogs in general). There are three main types: food allergies, contact allergies (caused by a reaction to topical substances such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals), and inhalant allergies (caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew). Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Australian Terriers, it is imperative to do your research to find Aussies of good breeding, with a multitude of health tests in the breeding program to ensure you get the healthiest possible dog that you can.
The Aussie enjoys the company of his human companions and does best when living in the house, not left to his own devices in the yard — which he will dig up like a gopher if given the chance. Your flowerbeds might stand a chance if you can train him to dig only in one designated spot in the yard, but don"t bet on it. Chances are he"ll make up his own mind about the best digging areas. You"ll be better off if you supervise him closely when he"s in the yard. Don"t leave him alone too long or he"ll be overcome by temptation, and your tidy landscaping will be only a memory. You must also fence your backyard to live amicably with your Aussie, who will take off after any cat, rat, or rabbit he sees if he"s not confined or supervised on a leash. Since all dogs in the Terrier group tend to be bossy and aggressive around other dogs, proper socialization of your Aussie puppy is a must. Regular obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is not only fun but is essential with this breed. Keep in mind, though, that the Aussie is a quick study — don"t bore him by practicing the same lessons over and over. In fact, you may find that your intelligent Aussie is the type who loves progressively challenging levels of obedience classes and agility training. Motivation is key: the task at hand must be challenging and fun, and you must offer an irresistible incentive, such as treats, toys, or verbal praise. You don"t work for free, and neither does the Aussie. Begin crate training when he"s a puppy. This will help you housetrain him, and it provides him with a welcome refuge as well as a familiar means of safe travel when he"s in the car. The spirited Aussie needs plenty of exercise — ideally, several brisk walks a day. He remains active well into his golden years.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup dry food a day. Unlike some small breeds, the Aussie is not a fussy eater. He has a hearty appetite, though he doesn"t usually overeat. For more on feeding your Australian Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.
The Aussie"s shaggy coat is rough to the touch, with a soft undercoat. About two inches in length over most of the body, it is longer on the chest and head. It comes in three color types: blue and tan (tan body with a blue saddle), sandy, and red. The Aussie sheds minimally, and it"s easy to groom him. Brush him once a week, trim his toenails once a month, and bathe him as needed — usually every three months or so, unless he has rolled in a scent that only a dog could love. Frequent bathing isn"t recommended because it softens the coarse terrier coat. While a soft coat isn"t harmful to any dog and is fine for a pet, it does detract from a show Aussie"s physical appearance. Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.
The Aussie makes a wonderful family pet, well suited to families with kids. He loves to play but, like all dogs, should be properly socialized and supervised around very young children. He prefers to be with his people and can become destructive when left alone too long. He also has a penchant for chasing cats and small animals, so he isn"t best suited to homes with rabbits, mice, or hamsters. However, with patient training, the Aussie can be taught to respect and leave alone the animals he lives with — but only those he lives with. He will eagerly chase the neighbor"s cat or a squirrel at a park.
Australian Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and you may find Australian Terriers in need of adoption and or fostering. Australian Terrier Rescue

Hailing from the Sahel region of the Sahara Desert, the proud and elegant Azawakh has long been a guardian, hunter, and companion to tribes in that region. He"s named for the Azawakh valley in the Sahara. Azawakhs are gentle and affectionate with their families, but they can be standoffish toward strangers and dislike being touched by people they don"t know. They"re also protective of their people and property. Fans describe them as a wonderful combination of loyal and independent. Because they"re sighthounds, they"re attracted by motion and are likely to chase animals, people on bicycles or skateboards, or even running children. On the other hand, these lean, muscular dogs make excellent companions for joggers and runners. Indoors, they"re fairly inactive and are content to snooze on the couch. They"re best suited to a home with a large fenced yard or a nearby fenced park where they can run flat out. They need at least a half hour a day of active exercise or play and, although it may seem like a slight to their dignity, you"ll need to outfit your Azawakh in a sweater before heading out in cold weather. With their short hair and low body fat, they get chilled easily.

A relative of the Poodle and Briard, this French water dog with the webbed paws gets down and dirty in pursuit of waterfowl, earning him the nickname "mud dog." He real name comes from the French word barbe, meaning beard, due to his bearded face. The Barbet is no newcomer — the first written reference to the breed dates back to 1387, although the breed may have originated as early as the eighth century. For centuries the Barbet served as a water retriever for royalty and commoner alike, and his thick, waterproof coat helped earn him a reputation for braving the chilliest water. King Henry IV was one royal fan, and legend has it that the king"s mistress was once reproached for bringing a Barbet to church. In addition to his retrieving skills, the Barbet is cherished for his versatility and his joyful, intelligent personality. In his homeland, he ranks among the top agility breeds and also loves to chase balls and flying discs. The breed is rare, with approximately 30 to 40 making their home in the United States and about 600 worldwide, but admirers of the Barbet hope others will come to share their love for this interesting dog.

Well known as the "barkless" dog from Africa, the Basenji attracts admirers with his short coat, small, muscular body, alert demeanor, erect ears, and tail curled tightly over one hip. A wrinkled brow gives him a quizzical and sometimes mischievous expression. All that sounds attractive, but people who don"t research the Basenji before acquiring one may be disappointed or frustrated when they aren"t prepared for the Basenji"s unique temperament and personality. Obtaining a Basenji from a reputable breeder who will discuss the pros and cons of living with this breed will give you a reality check, and such a breeder is also more likely to check breeding stock for heritable health problems breeding them. The Basenji is highly intelligent, but he has a stubborn streak a mile wide. The phrase "willing to please," used to describe so many breeds, is unknown to him. A Basenji may know perfectly well all the commands you teach him, but whether he actually performs them will always be in question. He may think first and then obey, or he may decide there"s really no good reason to do as you ask. Instead, Basenjis use their intelligence to demand your attention and get you to provide whatever it is they need or want. Basenji people say their breed is good at teaching you to pick up your house. Anything left out where the dog can find it is fair game to be chewed or eaten. You"ll soon learn to protect your belongings by putting them out of reach of these inquisitive dogs. Basenjis are also escape artists. Even a fenced yard will not contain a Basenji who is determined to be elsewhere. Unsupervised time alone in a yard could mean the loss of your treasured companion as he takes off to explore the world. Underground electronic fences also will not contain a Basenji who sees or smells something interesting. He considers the jolt from the collar a minor inconvenience. The Basenji is known for not barking, but that doesn"t mean he"s silent. His vocalizations range from a delightful yodel to a hair-raising scream, as well as the usual growls, whimpers, and whines made by all dogs. On the plus side, Basenjis love to play, although if you want a dog who"ll fetch a Frisbee or tennis ball, look elsewhere — the Basenji is not for you. They are clean dogs with almost feline grooming habits. If you keep an immaculate home, you will appreciate that Basenjis shed very little. They also make excellent watchdogs. They will defend their people and property when challenged. They are noted for their courage and will stand against an intruder with everything they have. That said, their size precludes them from being an actual guard dog. If you"d like to take up an activity with your dog, Basenjis are aces at the sport of lure coursing, the perfect game for these dogs who hunt by sight and love to chase. In it, they follow a lure — usually a white plastic bag — over a course in a field. The lure is tied to a line that is run by a series of pulleys as the dogs give chase. Agility is another sport that might suit the Basenji"s love of a good time. While Basenjis don"t excel in obedience competition, they can be successful if you can come up with a creative way to make them think that training and competition is their idea. Basenjis are also super show dogs thanks to their proud manner and striking copper coat. They"re easy to prepare for the show ring and have no need for trimming or complicated grooming. If you want a dog to show in the breed ring, discuss this with your breeder before purchase so she can help you choose the right puppy. With his unique appearance and personality, the Basenji is not the breed for everyone, but for those who appreciate this little dog"s attitude and intelligence, he can be the ideal companion. Who knows? You may even join the ranks of Basenji people who brag about the destruction their dogs can wreak.
Basenjis normally do not bark, but they can be very noisy, making sounds that include yodels, whines, and screams. They are hard to train. Basenjis survived for thousand of years by being independent thinkers. They see no need to obey humans. Positive training can work to an extent, but they will pick and choose when to obey. Basenjis have a strong prey drive and cannot be trusted off leash unless in a well-fenced area. Basenjis are escape artists. They will use a chain link fence as a ladder, jump up and climb over a wood fence, or bolt out open doors. Basenjis have a great deal of energy. If not provided with outlets for this they will become destructive or find other ways to burn off energy. Crating is recommended when not supervised. Basenjis consider themselves family. They cannot be left in a yard with food and water. They require a great deal of time and attention. They do not do well in homes with other small pets, as their instinct to chase may take over. If raised with cats they can do well but they"re not recommended for homes with hamsters, gerbils, rats, mice, guinea pigs, birds, or ferrets. Basenjis are stubborn, and you could end up with a confused and aggressive Basenji if you try to overcome his stubbornness with force. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Basenji is probably one of the oldest breeds of domesticated dog, and perhaps that"s why he"s not a barker. Early people may have preferred a quiet dog on hunts. Like his wild cousin the wolf, the Basenji can bark but usually barks only once and then is silent. It"s also theorized that he is only partially domesticated. His metabolism is unlike that of any other domesticated dog, and like wild canids the female Basenji only cycles once a year compared to twice a year for other domesticated dogs. Basenjis were discovered by Westerners in the Congo region of West Africa in the 19th century. There, the dogs were used to flush game into nets, to carry goods, and to warn of the approach of dangerous animals when on the trail. A good hunting Basenji was valued more than a wife by some tribes in Africa, not only for his hunting skill but also his resourcefulness and ingenuity. Attempts to bring the Basenji to Europe failed at first because the imported dogs all died of disease shortly after arrival. The first successful importation occurred in the 1930s both in England and the United States. The Basenji Club of America was formed in 1942, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1943. Phemister"s Bois was the first Basenji registered with the AKC, in 1944. Basenjis are rare, ranking 84th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC, so expect to spend time on a breeder"s waiting list if you decide this is the dog for you.
Males stand 17 inches at the shoulder and weigh about 24 pounds, females 16 inches and 22 pounds.
The Basenji is a hound. That means he"s intelligent and independent, but also affectionate and alert. He"s a sighthound, which means that motion catches his eye, and he"ll chase whatever he sees that moves — cats, squirrels, rabbits. He"s not the kind of dog who will obey commands instantly. He has to think about them and decide if he really wants to do what you"ve asked. Patience and a sense of humor are essential to living with a Basenji. He will chew up or eat whatever"s left in his reach, and he"s quite capable of putting together a plan to achieve whatever it is he wants, whether that"s to get up on the kitchen counter or break into the pantry where the dog biscuits are stored. He can be aloof with strangers, and he shouldn"t be trusted around cats or other small animals unless he"s been raised with them and you"re sure he recognizes them as family members. That recognition won"t apply to cats or small animals he sees outdoors, however. They"re fair game. Basenjis need early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they are not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Basenji puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling your young Basenji in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking your Basenji to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. Train him with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Basenji who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Basenjis will develop selective hearing if there"s something more exciting to pay attention to.
Basenjis are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Basenjis will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Basenjis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Fanconi Syndrome: Fanconi syndrome is a kidney disease that affects the normal processing of sugars and proteins. The dog urinates away the protein he needs to survive. Signs include excessive thirst, excessive urination, and elevated levels of glucose in the urine. It"s usually diagnosed in dogs that are 4 to 7 years old. Fanconi syndrome used to be considered fatal, but a new way to manage the disease has increased the life expectancy of dogs with this condition. There is no cure. There is also no test to determine if a dog is a carrier. Treatment is not necessarily expensive, but it is time-consuming as it involves giving your dog up to 30 pills daily. A reputable breeder should be able to show you which dogs in his bloodline have produced dogs with Fanconi Syndrome and which have not. Immunoproliferative Systemic Intestinal Disease: Commonly known as malabsorption, this condition is similar to irritable bowel disease in humans. Dogs ISID seem to have a permanent allergic reaction to the food they eat. Affected dogs will have chronic loose stools and difficulty with weight gain. Treatment includes minimizing stress, changing the diet often, and use of drugs to decrease histamine reaction. This condition has become far less common in Basenjis than in the past. Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (Hemolytic Anemia): This is a genetic condition in which affected Basenjis have two defective genes for the production of pyruvate kinase, an enzyme required to maintain healthy red blood cells. Basenjis with this disease usually don"t live much beyond their second birthday. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down. Coloboma: Coloboma is the common name to describe a gap or hole in the eye structure. The gap can occur anywhere in the eye, usually at the bottom of the eye. The condition is thought to be inherited, but no pattern has been established. Effects of the condition can be mild or severe depending on the size and location of the hole. Affected puppies must be spayed or neutered so they don"t pass on the condition. Progressive Retinal Atrophy(PRA): Once a minor concern in Basenjis it has recently become more of a problem. PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Umbilical Hernia: Umbilical hernia is present at birth where abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left without treatment. Some small hernias spontaneously close by the time the puppy is 6 months old and some dogs have lived with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done when the dog is being spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition where an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening "strangulation" of the intestine. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. That"s why it"s sometimes diagnosed in puppies whose parents were free of the disease.
The Basenji is a hunting dog and needs daily exercise. Some Basenjis do fine with a daily walk, while others require more enthusiastic forms of exercise. Basenjis raised with children often will spend their time wearing each other out. The Basenji is not a dog who can be left unattended in the backyard. He"s an accomplished escape artist, and an unwatched Basenji will soon become a missing Basenji. If you can provide him with a couple of 30-minute walks or play sessions every day, he"s well suited to apartment or condo life. Always keep your Basenji on leash unless you"re in a securely fenced area, and don"t count on any type of fence to keep him confined. He"ll use chain link as a ladder, and a wood fence is a deterrent only if you think to put the smooth side facing the yard where the dog is and then top it with an electric wire. Another feline characteristic of the Basenji is his dislike of rain. Expect him to be grumpy if you walk him when it"s wet out. The only time he might enjoy getting wet is on a really hot day.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. With his lightly built body, often likened to that of a deer, the Basenji is ill suited to carry excess weight. In other words, don"t let him get fat. Keep your Basenji"s physique sleek by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. Giving him plenty of daily exercise should do the rest. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can"t feel the ribs, he needs a little less food and a lot more exercise. For more on feeding your Basenji, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Basenji wears a short, fine coat of rich chestnut red, black, tricolor (black and chestnut), or brindle (black stripes on a chestnut background), all with white feet, chest, and tail tip. He may also have white on his legs, a white blaze running up the center of his face between his eyes, or a white collar — a white marking around his neck. You"ll always see more of his primary color than white. His markings stand out clearly and never look muddy. The Basenji is cat-like in his grooming habits and keeps himself very clean. He shouldn"t need a bath more than every few months. Basenjis shed — all dogs do — but the hair is so short and fine that it is not as noticeable as some other dogs" shedding fur is. Brush your Basenji"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Basenji enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Basenji to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Basenjis aren"t known for being especially fond of children, but with their high energy level, they can be good companions for older children. If they"re going to be around kids, it"s best if they"re raised with them from puppyhood. An adult Basenji who"s unfamiliar with children is most suited to a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. A Basenji shouldn"t be trusted around cats or other small animals unless he"s been raised with them and you"re sure he recognizes them as family members. That recognition won"t apply to cats or small animals he sees outdoors, however. They"re fair game.
Basenjis are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Basenjis in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Basenji rescue. Basenji Rescue and Transport, Inc.

He may be best known as the Hush Puppy dog, but the Basset Hound is much more than an advertising icon. With his placid personality and short-statured yet noble appearance, the Basset Hound is a popular family companion, as well as a slow-paced but keen hunting dog. The name Basset comes from the French word bas, meaning low. And Basset Hounds certainly are low to the ground. Because their bones are heavy and they are muscular, they usually weigh 50 to 65 pounds although they typically are no more than 14 inches tall at the highest point of the shoulder. In reality, they are big dogs on short legs. Their short-legged appearance is the result of a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. Despite his large size, the Basset believes he"s a lap dog and will do his best to fit in yours. Bassets are scent hounds, meaning that they were bred to hunt by following the scent of their prey. Their phenomenal sense of smell is second only to that of the Bloodhound. Basset Hounds have smooth, short, hard-textured coats that are relatively easy to take care of. Most of them come in the classic tri-color pattern of black, tan, and white, but they can also be what"s known as open red and white (red spots on a white coat), closed red and white (solid red with white feet and tail), or lemon and white. On occasion you may see a gray (also called blue) Basset, but this color is considered undesirable because it"s thought to be associated with genetic problems. The Basset Hound has a rounded skull with a deep muzzle and a lot of loose skin on the face, which is heavily wrinkled over the brow when the dog is tracking. This loose skin also causes Bassets to have a sad look, which many people think adds to their charm. Because they were originally bred to be hunting dogs, many of the features of the Basset Hounds have a purpose. Their long, low-set ears drag the ground and pick up scents, while the loose skin around their heads form wrinkles that further capture the scent of whatever they are tracking. Their short legs mean that they move more slowly than longer-legged dogs, which makes it easier for hunters on foot to follow them. Their tails are long and stand upright with a white tip at the end, which makes it easy for hunters to see when the dogs are in tall grass. Basset Hounds also have massive paws and their front feet turn outward slightly to balance the width of the shoulders. Around the house, Basset Hounds are calm and rather lazy. They are loyal to their people and have a pleasant, friendly disposition. Because they originally were bred as pack dogs, they love to be with their families and also do well with other pets. Bassets hate to be left alone for long periods of time, and may become destructive and howl if left alone for too long. Their distinctive baying bark is loud and travels long distances. Basset Hounds are hearty eaters, but because they aren"t very active in the house, they can gain weight and quickly become obese, which can cause them to have back and leg problems. Regular exercise is a must. Bassets have a great deal of endurance, so they enjoy taking long walks. When you"re walking your Basset, be aware that he loves to track. If he picks up a scent that he wants to follow, he can wander off if not on leash. Bassets are singleminded when trailing a scent and will follow it into the street in front of a car if they"re not leashed or confined by a fence. Lots of Basset people channel their dogs" superb scent-trailing skills in organized tracking events called basseting, which take place primarily in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Bassets are naturals at earning tracking, hunt test, and field trial titles, but they"ve also been known to compete successfully in agility, obedience, and rally, given a patient trainer. Patience is definitely a virtue when it comes to training a Basset. Unless you can persuade him that it"s something he wants to do, he can be stubborn and difficult to train. Many Basset Hounds will obey commands when offered food, but won"t obey if you don"t have a tasty reward to offer them. Housetraining a Basset is a challenge too, but with patience and persistence, you can train and housetrain your Basset. Just be sure to use gentle, positive training methods. Basset Hounds are emotionally sensitive and will shut down if treated roughly. Basset Hounds have unique voices. They generally howl (sometimes called a bay) rather than bark. They also have a unique, murmuring whine that they use when they want attention or are begging for food. Thanks to their delightfully imploring expressions, they"re often successful at winning treats of Chinese food, pizza, French fries, and other tasty junk food. Well-bred Bassets are even-tempered, relaxed, and generally happy dogs. They are very gentle with children and other pets. Their biggest faults are their tendency to drool and to howl when lonely or to sound an alarm. If you can tolerate his idiosyncrasies, the Basset can make a wonderful family companion, as happy to lounge around the house as he is to be out hunting.
Like all hounds, Bassets can be stubborn and difficult to train and housetrain. Crate training is recommended. If they catch an interesting scent, Basset Hounds may try to follow it, no matter how much danger it poses to them. Keep your Basset on leash when outside and not in a fenced yard. Also, take him to obedience class and be sure he responds well to the Come command. Use gentleness and patience to train him. Hounds of all types typically think for themselves and don"t respond well to harsh training techniques. One of the primary reasons that Basset Hounds are given up to rescue or for adoption is that they "drool too much." Because of the loose skin around their mouths, they also tend to make quite a mess when they drink. If you"re a fastidious housekeeper who can"t stand drool, a Basset Hound is not the best choice for you. Basset Hounds often have flatulence. If this problem seems excessive, talk to your vet. A change in diet may help. Obesity is a real problem for Basset Hounds. They love to eat and will overeat if given the chance. If they put on too much weight, they can begin to have joint and back problems. Portion out food relative to your Basset"s condition, not by the recommendation on the bag or can. Because Basset Hounds are prone to bloat (a potentially fatal condition), it"s better to feed them two or three smaller meals a day rather than one large meal a day. Don"t allow your Basset to exercise too strenuously after eating, and watch him for about an hour after eating to make sure he"s okay. Your Basset"s long ears need to be checked and cleaned each week to help prevent ear infections. You may find that you need to wash the ear flaps even more often, because they can drag in puddles and pick up dirt as they drag the ground. Basset Hounds can howl loudly, especially if they are left along for long periods of time. Even though your Basset Hound is strong and amazingly agile for having such short legs, it"s best to discourage him from jumping, for example, out of a car. Pick him up and support his back to ensure he doesn"t get hurt. Basset puppies can suffer from joint problems as they grow. Try not to allow your puppy to overdo things when he plays and discourage him from jumping on and off furniture. With two-thirds of their body weight in the front of their bodies, Basset Hounds are not great swimmers. Don"t allow your Basset Hound to fall into a swimming pool because he can quickly get into trouble. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Trust the French to develop such a distinctive breed, with its "jolie" appearance, jolie meaning pretty-ugly, or unconventionally attractive. The name Basset means "low" and in France it refers to a distinct level of hound by height. Bassets probably descended from the St. Hubert Hound, the ancestor of the present-day Bloodhound, and came about when a mutation in the St. Hubert strain produced a short-legged or dwarfed hound. Perhaps the dwarf hounds were kept as curiosities and later bred on purpose when their ability to track rabbits and hare under brush in thick forests was observed. The first recorded mention of a Basset Hound was in an illustrated book about hunting, La Venerie, written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585. From the illustrations, it appears that the early French Basset Hounds resembled the present-day Basset Artésien Normand, a dog breed today known in France. Basset Hounds were first popular with the French aristocracy, but after the French Revolution they became the hunting dogs of commoners who needed a dog they could follow on foot, not having access to horses. They made their way to Britain by the mid-19th century. Lord Galway imported a pair to England in 1866 and they produced a litter of five pups, but he didn"t show them so they remained relatively unknown. Then, in 1874, Sir Everett Millais imported a Basset Hound named Model from France. Millais promoted the breed in England and started a breeding program in his own kennel as well as in cooperation with breeding programs established by Lord Onslow and George Krehl. For his efforts in gaining publicity for the Basset Hound in England, Millais is considered to be the "father of the breed" in England. He first exhibited a Basset at an English dog show in 1875, but it was not until he helped make up a large entry for the Wolverhampton show in 1880 that the public started to take note of the breed. A few years later, the breed became even more popular when Alexandra, Princess of Wales, kept Basset Hounds in the royal kennels. In 1882, the Kennel Club in England accepted the breed, and in 1884, the English Basset Hound Club was formed. Although the Basset probably came to America in colonial times, the breed did not come into its own in the U.S. until early in the 20th century. The American Kennel Club (AKC) began registering Basset Hounds in 1885, the first one being a dog named Bouncer, but it wasn"t until 1916 that the AKC formally recognized the breed. The year 1928 was a turning point for the Basset Hound in America. In that year, Time magazine featured a Basset Hound on the front cover and ran an accompanying story about the 52nd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden written as if it was through the eyes of a Basset Hound puppy. The Basset Hound"s charm was discovered, and from that point on, the Basset Hound started growing in popularity. Bassets entered pop culture in a big way in the 1960s with their appearance in the advertising campaign for Hush Puppy shoes and the debut of the Fred Basset comic strip, which still runs today. The Basset Hound is currently ranked 28th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC, a testament to his enduring popularity. All throughout the U.S., Basset Hound people celebrate their love of the breed in ways that are as unique as their dogs" looks. Basset Hound picnics and waddles are traditions in many regions, sometimes drawing thousands of Bassets and their families. Some of these events even crown King and Queen Basset Hounds. Most hold such fun competitions as contests to determine which Basset has the best "waddling butt." These events usually have a wide variety of Basset Hound memorabilia, which often are sold to raise money for Basset Hound rescue organizations.
Basset Hounds stand no more than 14 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 65 pounds. They truly are big dogs with short legs. It"s not easy to lift an adult Basset Hound, so take that into account before you acquire one for a home with lots of stairs. Will you be able to get the dog in and out easily if he"s sick or old and needs to be carried?
The mild-mannered Basset is too laid-back to ever be sharp-tempered. He gets along with everyone, kids and other animals included, and the only thing that gets him really excited is a good scent trail. He"s calm indoors but alert enough that he makes an excellent watchdog. Like all hounds, he can be stubborn when it comes to training and responds best to positive methods such as food rewards and food rewards. Bassets are pack dogs and will be unhappy if left alone all day. The company of another dog is helpful. Like every dog, Basset Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Basset puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Basset Hounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Basset Hounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Basset Hounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Also called bloat or gastric torsion. This is a life-threatening condition that can affect deep-chested dogs like Basset Hounds, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food might also be factors in bloat. It is more common among older dogs, but can occur at any age. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs who develop this condition should be neutered or spayed. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a hereditary disorder that can cause mild to moderately severe bleeding and a prolonged bleeding time. If you suspect that your Basset has von Willebrand"s disease, ask your vet to do a blood test and take necessary precautions before any surgical procedure. Panosteitis (also called Wandering or Transient Lameness): This is an elusive ailment that is sometimes seen in young Basset Hounds. Its primary sign is sudden lameness and puppies usually outgrow it by the age of two years with no long-term problems. The lameness can be slight or severe. Many vets are not aware of this problem in Basset Hounds and may misdiagnose it as elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, or even more serious disorders. If misdiagnosed, the vet may want to do surgery on your dog that isn"t needed. If signs occur, ask for a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist before allowing surgery to be performed. Glaucoma: Basset Hounds are prone to glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside the eye. It can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. If you notice your Basset Hound squinting, tearing, or rubbing at his eyes, or if the eye or eyes appear to be red or bulging, take him to the vet immediately for a checkup. Glaucoma can cause damage to the retina and optic nerve in a matter of hours, so a trip to the emergency room can definitely be warranted. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Thrombopathia: This is another blood platelet disorder that is sometimes found in Basset Hounds. Like von Willebrand"s, thrombopathia affects the ability of the blood to clot. Eyelid and Eyelash Problems: Bassets are prone to ectropion (a turning out of the eyelids), resulting in a dry cornea, and entropion (a turning in of the eyelids), causing lashes to dig into the surface of the eye. Your vet should be able to determine if your Basset has either of these problems and can correct the problem surgically if needed. Intervertebral Disc Disease: Basset Hounds are especially prone to having back problems. This may be due to genetics, moving the wrong way, or falling or jumping on or off furniture. Signs of a back problem include an inability to raise up on the rear legs, paralysis, and sometimes loss of bowel and bladder control. It"s important to always support your Basset Hound"s back and rear when holding him. If a problem occurs, treatment may consist of anything from crate confinement with anti-inflammatory medications to surgery to remove the discs that are causing the problem or even confining the dog to a doggie wheelchair. Some owners have found that they can help ward off problems by taking their Basset Hounds to chiropractors that have experience in working with dogs. Ear Infections: Because the Basset"s long ears don"t allow sufficient circulation of air to the inside of the ear, infections can develop. Ward them off by cleaning your Basset"s ears every week and taking him to the vet if his ears smell bad or seem inflamed. Obesity: Obesity is a serious problem for long-backed breeds like Bassets. Although your Basset Hound is likely to be a "chow hound" and look at you pleadingly for more, find out how much you should feed him to maintain a healthy weight and stick to it for his own good. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs commonly in Basset Hounds. Many factors, including genetics, environment, and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Bassets may be able to lead normal, healthy lives, but some might require surgery to get around easily. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland beneath the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland.
Basset Hounds are usually calm dogs that do well even in small houses and apartments. They should live indoors with their family, ideally with access to a yard. They"re not suited to living outdoors in extreme heat or cold. Bassets are inactive indoors, happy to lie in the sun all day, but they"ll enjoy a long and meandering walk with lots of sniffing time. Don"t be tempted to let your Basset become a couch potato. Bassets are prone to obesity, and too much weight can stress their joints. When Bassets are outdoors, they should be in a fenced yard or on leash so they don"t wander off after an interesting scent. Until he"s a year old, discourage your Basset puppy from jumping on and off furniture and going up and down stairs, which puts extra stress on his front legs and back and can injure his joints. You may need to help a Basset of any age in and out of the car. He"s not a very good jumper. Consider getting him a ramp or steps. Bassets can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Basset who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Bassets will develop selective hearing if there"s something more exciting to pay attention to.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dog food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Bassets like to eat and are prone to obesity. Keep your Basset Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Basset Hound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Basset Hounds have smooth, short hair that repels dirt and water. The coat is dense enough to protect them in all sorts of weather. The skin is loose and elastic, giving the Basset his classic droopy hound dog appearance. The Basset Hound breed standard — a written description of how a breed looks and acts — allows all hound colors, but the most common colors are tri-color (tan, black, and white), black and white, brown and white, or red and white. Lemon and white is acceptable, but rarely seen. Because the standard says that any recognizable hound color is acceptable, blue Basset Hounds (actually gray) may be seen, but that coloration is undesirable because it"s the result of a recessive gene that has been associated with numerous genetic problems, such as periscoping intestines, skin allergies, and food allergies. Except for cleaning their ears and facial wrinkles and wiping up the drool they leave behind, Basset Hounds are easy to groom. Their short coats repel dirt and water. They rarely need baths (unless they have rolled in something particularly stinky), and a good rubdown with a bristle brush, a coarse cloth, or a hound glove is all that"s needed to keep their coats in good condition. Basset Hounds shed all year around, but if you brush them weekly, this shouldn"t be a problem. Basset Hound ears are long and drag the ground, so they can get very dirty. Ear infections are also an issue because air doesn"t circulate well in the inner ear. Clean the interior of your Basset Hound"s ears at least once a week with a solution recommended by your vet, wipe down the outside of the ears to remove any dirt, clean out the facial wrinkles with a damp cloth and thoroughly dry them, and check his large paws for sores between the toes. Brush your Basset"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Basset enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Basset to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Bassets are fond of children and get along well with them. If anything, you"ll need to protect your Basset from being ridden or otherwise tormented by them. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Being pack dogs, Bassets enjoy the company of other dogs and can also get along fine with cats, especially if they"re introduced at an early age.
Basset Hounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Bassets in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Basset rescue.

It"s difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle"s dark brown or hazel eyes, with his soft, pleading expression. They"re happy, outgoing and loving — characteristics more than balanced out by their hound nature, which is inquisitive, determined, and focused on food.They aren"t yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl, and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization usually is reserved for when they catch sight of quarry — or think it"s time to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and their human friends — and they think everyone is their new best friend.The most important thing to know about the Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his anatomy and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once described his in-laws" Beagle as "a nose with feet."You may have seen the Beagle"s nose at work at airports across the country. In 1984, the U.S. Department of Agriculture decided to use Beagles to sniff out contraband food being brought into the United States at the Los Angeles International Airport.The experiment was a huge success. Because they are small, friendly, and cute, the Beagles didn"t intimidate people who are afraid of dogs, and with their super nose power, they could be trained to identify specific food articles while bypassing those that weren"t contraband. Today, members of the "Beagle Brigade" patrol the baggage-claim areas at more than 20 international airports and other points of entry into the United States.Although they"ve branched out into other fields of work, Beagles remain superb hunters of small game. The National Beagle Club"s Institute Farm hosts AKC-sanctioned field trials where breeders with packs are put to the test in the field. Many other countries have similar activities for hunting Beagles.Because of their small size and gentle temperament, Beagles can do well in apartments if their people are willing to walk them on lead several times a day in all kinds of weather. They need plenty of exercise, about an hour a day if possible. If left alone and unexercised, Beagles can become destructive.
Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate training is absolutely recommended. Beagles can get bored if left alone in a house too long. If left in a backyard, Beagles will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to escape. The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners" neighbors got tired of their baying. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling. Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped! Since they are scenthounds, Beagles will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world. Although they are loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist). Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are "chow hounds" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best. In regards to food, your Beagle probably will take its food bowl pretty seriously. Teach children to respect your Beagle while it is eating, and not to approach it or tease it with food. Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they"re usually friendly to everyone they meet.
The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain. It"s thought that it may have been derived from the French word begueule, meaning open throat, or from the Old English word beag, meaning small. Others think it may have come from the French word beugler, meaning to bellow, or the German word begele, meaning to scold.The breed"s history is cloudy as well because breeds as we know them today didn"t really develop until the 19th century. Greek documents from 400 B.C. describe Beagle-like dogs, and the Romans may have brought small rabbit-hunting hounds with them to England and bred them with the local hounds.William the Conqueror reportedly brought Talbot hounds (now extinct) to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the Beagle and the Foxhound.Beagles became popular in England very early in its history. During the reigns of Edward II (1307 - 1327) and Henry VII (1485 - 1509), extremely small beagles, called Glove Beagles, were popular. They reportedly were small enough to be held in a gloved hand. There"s also mention of Singing Beagles, named for their bugling voices.Elizabeth I (1533 - 1603) kept packs of Pocket Beagles that stood only 9 inches tall. These small dogs were depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy nosed. They were used for hunting, but quickly fell out of favor because they weren"t very fast.In the 1700s, fox hunting became popular in England, and the Beagle fell out of favor as the larger Foxhound became the dog of choice. If it hadn"t been for the farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales who continued to keep packs to hunt rabbit and hare, the breed might have become extinct at that time.In the mid-1800s Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a pack of Beagles in Essex, England. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the modern Beagle. Rev. Honeywood bred for hunting skills, not looks. Thomas Johnson, a fellow Englishman, was responsible for breeding Beagles who were both attractive and good hunters.At about the same time, American breeders started importing Beagles from England to improve the looks of their own dogs. Many of the English imports were bred to an average height of 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder so they could hunt fox. American breeders started breeding them to be smaller for rabbit hunting.Of interest is the "Patch" Beagle strain developed by Willet Randall in New York around 1880. The line is primarily white with a very large tri-colored spot. They were very popular in the 1940s and 1950s because they were able to run so fast. Today, many people call lemon and white or red and white beagles "Patch" beagles.The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club both were founded in 1884. In that same year, the AKC began registering Beagles.In 1916, five members of the National Beagle Club purchased 508 acres in Western Loudoun County, Virginia for the purpose of holding field trials. The men who purchased it formed a corporation called Institute Corporate to purchase and own the land, then leasing it to the Institute Foundation that maintains the property for the National Beagle Club, which today is the site of many activities of the National Beagle Club.
The American Kennel Club recognizes two varieties of Beagle. The 13-inch variety is for hounds that don"t exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder, and the 15-inch variety is for hounds that stand 13 inches to 15 inches at the shoulder. Depending on their height, Beagles weigh between 18 and 30 pounds.
Beagles are gentle, sweet, and funny. They will make you laugh, but that"s when they"re not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and they often must resort to food rewards to lure the Beagle into a state of temporary obedience.Like every dog, the Beagle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Not all Beagles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Intervertebral Disk Disease: The spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column, and between the bones of the vertebral column are intervertebral discs that work as shock absorbers and allow normal movement of the vertebrae. The discs are made of two layers, an outer fibrous layer and an inner jelly-like layer. Intervertebral disc disease occurs when the jelly like inner layer protrudes into the spinal canal and pushes against the spinal cord. Compression of the spinal cord may be minimal, causing neck or back pain, or it can be severe, causing loss of sensation, paralysis, and lack of bowel or bladder control. The damage done by the spinal compression may be irreversible. Treatment is based on several factors, including location, severity, and length of time between injury and treatment. Confining the dog may be of some use, but surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is not always successful. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland under the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland. Glaucoma: This is a painful disease in which pressure in the eye becomes abnormally high. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor — if the fluid doesn"t drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases causing damage to the optic nerve and resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, and secondary glaucoma which is a result of inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally affects one eye first, which will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won"t react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment (surgery or medication, depending on the case). Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Beagle Dwarfism: This is a condition where the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs. Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS): This is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Beagles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
A fenced backyard is a necessity with a scenthound such as a Beagle. When outside, your Beagle should be on lead in unconfined areas, or securely confined and supervised. He"s a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he"s microchipped and wearing identification tags on his collar so he can be returned to you.Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn"t prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it.Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply switch off when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat.Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love to go for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have trained your dog to come back to you). They"ll enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they"re 18 months or older before starting them on a repetitive exercise like this.When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, getting up for meals and perhaps an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed prone to obesity, don"t let this happen.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they"re willing to eat until they pop. Keep yours in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.Also, dole out treats sparingly. Your Beagle will be just as happy to get a bite-size training treat as a bigger biscuit.For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The breed standard for Beagles says "any hound color" is acceptable. The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle.The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs and tip of the tail. Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they"re hunting in tall grass.Beagles have a smooth, dense double coat that is resistant to rain. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth.Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it isn"t too noticeable. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring. They are clean dogs (unless, of course, they"ve found something appealingly stinky to roll in) and generally don"t require frequent baths.Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn"t circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears. Never allow water or oils to enter his ears.Brush your Beagle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Beagle to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children. In addition, Beagles tend to be "mouthy," grabbing things, including your or your child"s hand, with their mouths to play. They do this in fun and can be trained not to do this.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don"t like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.
Beagles are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. The following rescue groups can help you find Beagles in need of adoption or fostering.

When anyone describes a Bearded Collie, the adjective most often used is enthusiastic! That word, along with hardy, exuberant, active, energetic, bright, reliable, and trustworthy should give you the beginnings of a picture of this well-loved breed. The Bearded Collie, known affectionately as the Beardie, is the ultimate shaggy dog. The name Bearded Collie comes from the hair that hangs down from the chin and forms a beard. The Beardie"s enthusiasm is displayed in his bouncy nature. It"s said that Beardies working in thick undergrowth in Scotland would bounce up to see where the sheep were and that when confronted by stubborn sheep they bark and bounce in front of it to get it to move. Whatever the case, Bearded Collies bounce along through life with a constantly wagging tail and an upbeat, clownish attitude. Nonetheless, they"re not the breed for everyone. Beardies are highly intelligent, active and resourceful. It takes a smart and energetic person to keep up with them. People who live with Beardies must enjoy brushing long hair and be willing to deal with a beard of hair that drips water after every drink and hairy feet that track in mud and debris after every venture outdoors. Bearded Collies are sociable and will demand to be included in all family activities, indoors or out. A bored Beardie will put his considerable intelligence and energy into causing trouble. Bearded Collies are excellent with children; their high energy level makes them active playmates who will spend hours running and playing. They are rambunctious, however, and young children should always be supervised when interacting with any breed of dog to prevent injury to both. Beardies are outgoing, affectionate dogs, but they can have a stubborn and independent streak from a heritage that required them to make their own decisions while herding sheep. Obedience training is a must if you are going to establish order and discipline in your dog"s life. Make learning fun, and teach them with positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Bearded Collies do not learn under abusive or harsh conditions. Begin training early and you will obtain excellent results. Because of their herding heritage, Beardies are alert and make good watchdogs, barking to let you know that someone has arrived. They"ll also bark to tell you that they"re happy or excited or that they"re bored or alone and would like some attention. Teach them to control their barking when they"re young, or you"ll have a nuisance barker on your hands. Beardies will include other animals in their family "flock" if introduced to them properly, preferably when young. Being herding dogs, they"re always open for a game of chase the cat if the cat wants to play, and sometimes even when it doesn"t! They are not dog-aggressive and will play happily with other dogs from Chihuahuas to Great Danes. If you"re looking to add a little Beardie bounce into your life and you believe after meeting some Beardies and breeders that this is the breed for you, then you can look forward to having an active, lively companion for 12 to 14 years. A Bearded Collie is always ready for whatever is up next, whether that is competing in the show ring or in obedience or agility trials, herding sheep as an occupation or for herding trials, chasing Frisbees in the backyard, playing with the kids, or hanging with the family. A Bearded Collie is ready to do it all.
Beardies don"t like to be confined and may become nuisance barkers if frequently left alone. Beardies require about an hour of exercise daily in a fenced area where they can run. Beardies can be headstrong, so obedience training is a must. Start early! Bearded Collies will bark to let you know people are approaching, but they are not guard dogs of any kind. A bored Beardie is an excellent escape artist! The Bearded Collie coat requires weekly brushing, more during their annual shedding season. Some Beardies can react to monthly heartworm preventive. Discuss this with your veterinarian to decide whether a daily preventive is a better choice. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Bearded Collie is one of the oldest breeds in Britain. Sometimes called the Highland Collie, the Mountain Collie, or the Hairy Mou"ed Collie, shaggy herding dogs of this type existed for centuries as helpmeets to farmers. Farmers bred for working ability and didn"t keep records, so how the Beardie came to be is unknown, but it"s believed that a Polish merchant visiting Scotland in the 1500s traded a pair of Polish Lowland Sheepdogs for other commodities. Those dogs were probably crossed with local sheepdogs to develop what became the Bearded Collie. The earliest visual portrayals of Bearded Collie-type dogs are in a portrait painted by Gainsborough in 1771, and in a Reynolds portrait from 1772. A description of the breed was published in 1818 in an edition of Live Stock Journal. Bearded Collies were popular working and show dogs at the end of the Victorian era, but they had no breed club and no official standard (a written description of how the breed should look and act). The breed was kept alive by shepherds who valued their working abilities and continued to use them as working sheepdogs. The development of the modern Bearded Collie is credited to G.O. Willison, who began breeding Beardies for the show ring after World War II. She was instrumental in forming the Bearded Collie Club in Britain in 1955. In 1959 the Kennel Club granted rights to show for Challenge Certificates and Championships. The breed gained in popularity after that. Bearded Collies first came to the United States in the late 1950s, but none of those dogs were bred. The first litter was born in the U.S. in 1967. By 1969 the Beardie had enough people interested in him that they were able to form the Bearded Collie Club of America. The breed was admitted into the American Kennel Club"s Working Group on February 1, 1977. It moved to the Herding Group when that group was established in January 1983. Today the Bearded Collie ranks 104th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
A Bearded Collie male stands 21 to 22 inches at the shoulder; females 20 to 21 inches at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 45 to 55 pounds.
A Beardie is smart, resourceful, and confident. His bouncy, bubbly personality makes him fun to be with, but when it comes to training he can be an independent thinker who likes to have his own way. He"s a boisterous playmate for children and has a sense of humor that makes him a joy to be around. When choosing a Beardie puppy, remember that temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Temperament varies in individual dogs. Some Beardies are sweet and quiet, while others are loud and enthusiastic. Tell the breeder what you"re looking for in a dog, and she can help you choose the puppy that will fit your personality and lifestyle. Always meet at least one of the parents (usually the mother is the one who"s available) to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
Bearded Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Beardies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a Beardie. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down.
The Beardie is an indoor/outdoor dog. He needs to live inside with his people with access to a yard or fenced acreage where he can run. He"s not suited to apartment life. Beardies enjoy being with their people, whether they"re indoors or outdoors. They"ll be satisfied with a couple of half-hour walks or play sessions with a ball daily. Obedience training is a must if you are going to establish order and discipline in your dog"s life. Make learning fun, and teach them with positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Bearded Collies do not learn under abusive or harsh conditions. Begin training early and you will obtain excellent results. To ensure that he doesn"t accidentally knock over a toddler or older person, teach him to sit for attention.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dog food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies eat 3 to 4 cups daily. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Beardie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Beardie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
To protect him from Scottish weather extremes, the Beardie has a flat, harsh, strong and shaggy outer coat and a soft, furry undercoat. The coat falls naturally to either side without need of a part. Long hair on the cheeks, lower lips, and under the chin forms the beard for which he is known. All Bearded Collies are born black, blue, brown, or fawn, with or without white markings. Some carry a fading gene, and as they mature, the coat lightens, darkening again slightly after one year of age. A puppy born black may become any shade of gray from black to slate to silver. The dogs that are born brown will lighten from chocolate to sandy, and the blues and fawns show shades from dark to light. Dogs without the fading gene stay the color they were when they were born. The white only occurs as a blaze on the face, on the head, on the tip of the tail, on the chest, legs, feet, and around the neck. Tan markings occasionally appear on the eyebrows, inside the ears, on the cheeks, under the root of the tail and on the legs where the white joins the main color. The Beardie"s long double coat requires weekly brushing with a bristle or pin brush to remove tangles and mats and reduce shedding. Mist the coat with a conditioning spray before brushing to reduce static and keep the hairs from breaking. If you run across any mats or tangles, spray them with some anti-tangle spray and work them out with your fingers until you can run a comb through the hair smoothly. Completely brushing the coat takes half an hour to an hour each week. Bathing can be done as needed. As your Beardie puppy matures from 9 to 18 months of age, his soft puppy coat will start to come out. Brush him two or three times a week to help remove it and prevent mats. Once his adult coat has come in, brushing him weekly will be plenty. Beardies shed heavily once a year for two to four weeks, and you"ll probably want to brush more frequently during this time to keep the level of loose hair under control. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Beardie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Nails should be trimmed regularly to keep them short. Your Beardie"s nails may need to be trimmed weekly or only monthly; each dog is different. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your bouncy Beardie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Beardie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Full of bounce, humor, and energy, Beardies are excellent playmates for kids. Of course, it"s important to teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Beardies get along well with other dogs and cats if they"re introduced to them early, although they can be possessive of their toys. "Mine, all mine" is their motto. They always enjoy a game of chase, so they do best with cats that stand their ground rather than turn tail and run.
Beardies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Beardies end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Contact the rescue organization for more information about available dogs and adoption requirements.

The Bedlington Terrier captures your attention with his unique lamblike appearance and keeps it with his entertaining, opinionated personality. Don"t let his appearance fool you, however. The Bedlington is all terrier: inquisitive, intelligent, alert, and aggressive toward small animals outdoors.Bedlingtons throw themselves with enthusiasm into the activities of their family. They love to be the center of attention and will play the clown to get it. Bedlingtons welcome guests and entertain them with their antics, but they"ll let you know if they think someone"s shady. Bedlington people say their dogs have astute judgment and make excellent watchdogs.Exercise is important to keep a Bedlington happy and healthy, but he has moderate energy levels and activity needs. He"ll match his activity level to yours and can be satisfied with a nice walk or vigorous game of fetch. He can jog with you or go on a hike. Although he"s rarely used in the field, his hunting abilities include pointing, retrieving, tracking, and, of course, going to ground after den animals. Whatever you do with him, he"s happy to be a couch potato afterward.When he"s raised with children, the Bedlington can be an energetic playmate. Make sure extremely young children are supervised by an adult when interacting with any dog to prevent injury to both. While a Bedlington will tolerate a certain amount of rough handling, he will set limits when things get too rough, and he doesn"t understand that a child"s skin isn"t as tough as another dog"s.Bedlingtons can get along well with other dogs, especially if they"re raised with them. Like most terriers, they might not start a fight, but they won"t back down from one. The Bedlington may look fluffy and sweet, but he"s no pushover and won"t accept readily another dog"s attempt to dominate him. Bedlingtons can be fierce fighters if aroused, so be cautious when introducing them to new canine companions, especially other adults of the same sex. Male Bedlingtons especially will persist in a fight until major damage is done.The Bedlington is intelligent, and that intelligence makes him only moderately easy to train. He does best when you can persuade him that doing what you want is really his idea or benefits him in some way. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Harsh words and physical force will not work with this breed, as they will only bring out his stubborn streak and begin a battle of wills that you will probably lose. Nonetheless, Bedlingtons have competed successfully in the obedience ring. They view the agility ring as an excellent opportunity show off their speed, grace, and enthusiasm. And naturally your Bedlington will love Earth Dog competitions in which he can display his terrier tenacity and willingness to find prey underground.With proper training and socialization, the Bedlington is an excellent companion and enthusiastic partner in all family activities. You will appreciate his sense of humor and eagerness to get the most out of life.
Bedlingtons can be stubborn at times. Early socialization with other pets is a must to prevent problems. Bedlington Terriers need exercise and mental stimulation or they will get bored, which leads to trouble. Males can be fierce fighters if challenged by another dog. Bedlingtons are highly intelligent and moderately easy to train. They don"t respond to harsh training methods. Bedlingtons require grooming once or twice weekly to maintain the coat and prevent matting. Bedlingtons can be one-person dogs. Bedlingtons are terriers and like to dig. Bedlingtons require a fenced yard. They will chase other animals and they are very fast. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Bedlington Terrier was developed in the north of England, but where he came from is anybody"s guess. One theory has it that he traveled with Rom, or gypsies, who used him to poach game on the estates they passed by. His talents in ridding the land of rats, badgers, and other vermin drew the attention of the local squires, who acquired some of the dogs for themselves.One of their noble fans was Lord Rothbury, whose estate was located in Bedlington in the county of Northumberland. For a time, they were known as Rothbury terriers, but eventually the name Bedlington stuck. The first dog to actually be called a Bedlington Terrier, in 1825, was Ainsley"s Piper, owned by Joseph Ainsley of Bedlington. Piper went up against his first badger when he was only 8 months old, and he was still showing other dogs how it was done when he was old, toothless, and nearly blind.There is speculation that the Whippet was added to the breed at some point to increase the dog"s speed and agility. He also has similarities to the Dandie Dinmont, Soft Coated Wheaten, and Kerry Blue Terriers, so he may share common ancestors with them.The popularity of Bedlingtons crossed all social boundaries. They were favorites of factory and mine workers, who used them to rid the premises of rats and then raced them in their off hours, against each other and against Whippets.Bedlingtons joined other dogs in the show ring in the mid-1800s, and the National Bedlington Terrier Club was formed in England in 1877. The first Bedlington Terrier to be registered by the American Kennel Club was Ananias in 1886. Today the Bedlington ranks 128th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males stand 16 inches at the shoulder; females, 15 inches. Weight ranges from 17 to 23 pounds and should be proportionate to height.
Alert, energetic, and intelligent, the Bedlington is an excellent companion and watchdog. He enjoys being the center of attention and likes to entertain his people. He can be aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex and will chase small furry animals.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Bedlingtons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bedlington puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Bedlington Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bedlingtons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bedlingtons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Copper Toxicosis: This hereditary disease is caused by failure of the liver to expel dietary copper, leading to a buildup in the body resulting in illness and death. It is an autosomal recessive trait; affected dogs must inherit a gene from both parents to be symptomatic. If they inherit a gene from only one parent, they will be a carrier. The recent development of a DNA test makes it possible to screen for affected dogs and carriers and remove them from the gene pool. Patellar Luxation: This is a dislocation of the kneecap (patella) and is sometimes referred to as slipped stifles. It can be from injury or congenital (present at birth). Patellar Luxation can be mild with little or no symptoms or severe with intense pain and limping. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then removing them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Renal Cortical Hypoplasia: This condition occurs when the cortex of one or both of the kidneys develops abnormally. The dog will develop kidney failure. First signs of kidney failure are increased thirst that causes an increase in urination. There is no cure; the treatment consists of managing the signs and trying to prevent additional damage to the kidneys. Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Most cases are mild and there is no detectable loss in vision. Veterinary ophthalmologists can do tests to determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Retinal dysplasia shouldn"t affect a dog"s ability to function as a companion, but affected dogs shouldn"t be bred.
Bedlington Terriers are a hardy breed with moderate activity levels. They are capable of running at high speeds, so a safely fenced area is important. They are not suited to living outdoors. They are small enough to be appropriate for an apartment as long as they have a safe place to exercise.Exercise for the Bedlington can mean a nice walk or a vigorous game of fetch. He can jog with you or go on a hike. You can also train him for agility, obedience, or tracking. He"s quiet in the home, happy to relax on the sofa with you.The Bedlington is intelligent, and that intelligence makes him only moderately easy to train. He does best when you can persuade him that doing what you want is really his idea or benefits him in some way. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Harsh words and physical force will not work with this breed, as they will only bring out his stubborn streak and begin a battle of wills that you will probably lose.Like all dogs, Bedlington puppies can be destructive. Crate them to prevent them from getting into trouble if you"re not around to supervise.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Bedlington in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.

Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Bedlington, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bedlington"s distinctive coat is an unusual combination of harsh and soft hair. It feels crisp but not wiry and has a tendency to curl, especially on the head and face. It doesn"t shed much. The coat of a Bedlington trimmed for the show ring is no longer than one inch on the body, with the hair on the legs slightly longer.We tend to think of him as white, but the Bedlington comes in several colors and combinations: blue, sandy, liver, blue and tan, sandy and tan, and liver and tan. In bi-colors, the tan markings are found on the legs, chest, under the tail, inside the hindquarters and over each eye. Bedlington puppies are dark when they"re born and lighten as they mature. The topknot (a tuft of longer hair on top of the head) of all adults should be lighter than the body color.Unlike many terrier breeds, the Bedlington"s coat doesn"t need to be stripped. You"ll need to comb him at least once a week. You can take him to a professional groomer for his lamb clip, or your Bedlington"s breeder can show you how to clip him yourself. The face must be hand-scissored to achieve the unique appearance.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bedlington"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Bedlington enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Bedlington to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
When he"s raised with children, the Bedlington can be an energetic playmate. He"s probably best suited to homes with older children. While a Bedlington will tolerate a certain amount of rough handling, he will set limits when things get too rough, and he doesn"t understand that a child"s skin isn"t as tough as another dog"s.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Bedlingtons can get along with other dogs, especially if they"re raised with them, but they may be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex. And like most terriers, they might not start a fight, but they won"t back down from one. Bedlingtons can be fierce fighters if aroused, so be cautious when introducing them to new canine companions, especially other adults of the same sex. Male Bedlingtons especially will persist in a fight until major damage is done. A Bedlington might learn to get along with your indoor cat if he"s raised with him, but outdoor cats and other animals will be fair game for him to chase.

The Belgian Malinois (pronounced MAL-in-wah) is a medium-size Belgian shepherd dog that at first glance resembles a German Shepherd Dog. Malinois are shorthaired, fawn-colored dogs with a black mask. They are one of four types of Belgian herding dogs, and have been shown in the U.S. as a separate breed since 1959.Originally developed in Malines, Belgium, Malinois have a great deal of stamina and truly enjoy working. They are intelligent and very active dogs that excel at many tasks. In addition to herding, they also do well with police work, search and rescue, and in performance events, such as agility.People who are not familiar with the Malinois often confuse him with the German Shepherd Dog (GSD), but there are significant differences in the body structure and temperament of the two breeds. Malinois are smaller dogs with lighter bones. They stand with their weight well on their toes, which gives them a square body profile, while today"s GSD has a long, sloping back and carries his weight flatter on his feet.Malinois are fawn-colored, red, or brown, and the tips of their hair are black, while the GSD is usually tan with a black saddle. Additionally, the Malinois has a more refined, chiseled head that the GSD and smaller, more triangular ears.Many think that the Malinois is more alert and quicker to respond than the GSD. They"re also very sensitive dogs that don"t respond well to harsh training methods. Some Malinois are friendly and assertive, but others are reserved and aloof with strangers. They should never have a fearful or aggressive temperament. Because of their energy level and sensitivity, Malinois are recommended only for people who have previously owned dogs and have experience with dog training. Malinois are very intense dogs who like to be included in all of the family activities. They aren"t well suited for people who work long hours or must travel often, leaving their dog at home.If you have decided that the Malinois is the breed for you, you should expose yours to many different people, dogs, other animals and situations as early as possible. Puppy kindergarten classes are recommended for your Malinois puppy, followed by obedience training class.Malinois are quick learners and eager to do whatever their people ask of them. They excel are obedience, tracking, agility, flyball, herding, showing, Schutzhund and other protection sports, search and rescue, and police work. Trainers describe them as having a high "play drive," which means that they love to play, and about anything you ask them to do is play to them.But the Malinois" owner should never forget that this is a breed that was developed to protect and herd. Poorly bred Malinois or ones that have been poorly socialized may be aggressive out of fear or shyness. Additionally, although well-socialized Malinois are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing.
Belgian Malinois have a great deal of energy and need a lot of exercise. Make sure you have the room and time to provide it. Malinois are very intelligent and alert. They also have strong herding and protection instincts. Early, consistent training is critical! Although they are good-size dogs, they are very people-oriented and want to be included in family activities. Malinois are constant shedders. They shed heavily twice a year. Belgian Malinois are intense dogs that are play-oriented and sensitive. Training should be fun, consistent, and positive. Because of their intelligence, high energy, and other characteristics, Malinois are not recommended for inexperienced dog owners. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Belgian Malinois is one of four varieties of Belgian Sheepdogs, which were developed in Belgium in the late 1800s. The four varieties are the Malinois (fawn-mahogany, short coat with black mask), Tervuren (fawn-mahogany, long coat with black mask) the Laekenois (fawn, rough coat), and the Groenendael (black, long coat). The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes all but the Laekenois as separate breeds in the U.S., while the United Kennel Club recognizes all four types as one.The Club du Chien de Berger Belge (Belgian Shepherd Dog Club) was formed in September 1891 to determine which of the many different types of dogs was representative only of the shepherd dogs developed in Belgium. In November of that same year, breeders and fanciers met on the outskirts of Brussels to examine shepherd dogs from that area. After much deliberation, veterinary professor Adolphe Reul and a panel of judges concluded that the native shepherd dog of that province were square, medium-size dogs with well-set triangular ears and very dark brown eyes and differed only in the texture, color, and length of hair. Subsequent examinations of dogs in other Belgian provinces resulted in similar findings.In 1892, Professor Reul wrote the first Belgian Shepherd Dog standard, which recognized three varieties: dogs with long coats, dogs with short coats, and dogs with rough coats. The Club du Chien de Berger Belge asked the Societe Royale Saint-Hubert (Belgium"s equivalent to the AKC) for breed status, but was denied. By 1901, however, the Belgian Shepherd Dog was finally recognized as a breed.Today"s Malinois can be traced to a breeding pair owned by a shepherd from Laeken named Adrien Janssens. In 1885, he purchased a pale, fawn rough-haired dog called Vos I, or Vos de Laeken from a cattle dealer in northern Belgium. Janssens used Vos I (which means fox in Flemish) to herd his flock and also bred him to a short-haired, brindle-brown dog named Lise (also known as Lise de Laeken or Liske de Laeken). After that mating, Vos I was bred to his daughters, establishing a line of very homogeneous dogs with grey rough-hairs and short-hairs, and fawn rough-hairs and short-hairs. Today, Vos I and Lise de Laeken are recognized as ancestors not only of the modern Belgian Shepherd Dogs as well as the Bouvier des Flandres and Dutch Shepherd Dogs.Breeders decided to give each of the different varieties of Belgian Shepherd Dogs their own names. The city of Malines had formed a club for the promotion of fawn shorthairs Belgian Shepherd dog in 1898. Louis Huyghebaert, an early breeder under the "ter Heide" kennel name, as well as a judge, author and the "godfather of the Malinois" (and the Bouvier), along with the Malines club had done much to help popularize these short-hairs, so the name "Malinois" came to be associated with the fawn shorthairs.In 1897, a year before the formation of the Malines club, Huyghebaert, suggested that since there weren"t very many sheep left in Belgium, that the shepherd dogs should have field trials that showcased their intelligence, obedience and loyalty. From this recommendation, dressage trials for the shepherd dogs were developed that tested a dog"s ability to jump and perform other exercises. The first dressage trial, held on July 12, 1903 in Malines, was won by M. van Opdebeek and his Malinois, Cora van"t Optewel.Belgian Shepherds were also used as guard dogs and draught dogs. They were the first dogs to be used by the Belgian police. Before World War II, international police dog trials became very popular in Europe, and Belgian dogs earned a number of prizes at the trials.When World War I broke out, many Belgian Shepherd Dogs were used by the military for a number of jobs including messenger dogs, Red Cross dogs, ambulance cart dogs and, according to some, light machine-gun cart dogs.During the 1920s and 1930s, several outstanding Malinois kennels were started in Belgium. During the first decades of the 20th century, Malinois and Groenendael were the most popular varieties of the Belgian Shepherd dogs to be exported to other countries. At that time, many were exported to the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Canada, United States, Argentina and Brazil.In 1911, two Groenendaels and two Malinois were registered by the AKC as "German Sheepdogs." In 1913, the AKC changed the name to "Belgian Sheepdogs." The first dogs were imported by Josse Hanssens of Norwalk, Connecticut. He sold the two Malinois to L.I. De Winter of Guttenberg, New Jersey. De Winter produced several litters from the Malinois under his Winterview kennel name.After World War I, many American servicemen brought back Malinois and other Belgian Shepherd Dogs from Europe, and AKC registrations increased rapidly. The first Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in 1924 and became a member club of the AKC soon after that. In 1924 and 1925, Walter Mucklow, a lawyer in Jacksonville, Florida, popularized the Malinois through AKC Gazette articles that he wrote. He also bred Malinois for a short time under the name of Castlehead Kennel.By the end of the 1920s, the Groenendael and Malinois Belgian Sheepdogs had risen in popularity to rank among the top five breeds. During the Great Depression, dog breeding was a luxury that most couldn"t afford, and the first Belgian Sheepdog Club of America ceased to exist. During the 1930s, a few Malinois were registered with the AKC as imports trickled into the country. Even after the Great Depression, there were so few Malinois and interest in the breed had dropped so much that the AKC put them in the Miscellaneous Class at AKC shows in the 1930s and "40s.In 1949, a second Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in Indiana. In that same year, John Cowley imported two Malinois and began his Netherlair kennel. He showed several of his dogs and several people became interested in them. By the 1960s, more people were breeding and showing Malinois. In March 1992, the American Belgian Malinois Club received AKC parent club status.In the last decade, Belgian Malinois dogs have received a lot of attention for their work in the military, drug detection agencies, search and rescue operations, and police forces around the country. As a result, many Malinois have been imported to the U.S. in the last several years. They rank 90th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
Males are 24 to 26 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 60 to 80 pounds. Females are 22 to 24 inches tall and weigh 40 to 60 pounds.
This is an outstanding working dog who is confident and protective in any situation. He"s affectionate with family members but reserved toward strangers until he takes their measure. The watchdog abilities of the Malinois are excellent. He protects his people and property with only as much force as is required. Shyness and aggression are never appropriate in this breed.That said, temperament doesn"t just happen. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Malinois need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malinois puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Belgian Malinois are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Malinois will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Malinois, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Elbow Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain. Anesthesia Sensitivity. Belgian Malinois are very sensitive to anesthesia. They have a higher than average rate of death when put under anesthesia because of their muscle to fat ratio. Be sure your vet understands this sensitivity before allowing your Malinois to have surgery or even have its teeth cleaned.
Belgian Malinois can do well in small quarters if they receive enough exercise. They prefer cool climates but adapt well to warmer environments. They do best when they are allowed to be a part of the family and are able to live indoors at least part of the time.If possible, provide your Malinois with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. Malinois need about 20 minutes of activity three or four times a day, and a leisurely walk won"t satisfy them. They"re built for action. If you like to hike or jog, your Belgian Malinois will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience or agility. It doesn"t really matter what you do as long as you keep him active. Don"t be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it"s a remnant of his herding heritage.Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes, daily half-mile walks, and playtime in the yard will meet their needs. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Malinois pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Malinois are sensitive and highly trainable. Be firm, calm, and consistent with them. Anger and physical force are counterproductive.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Malinois, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Malinois have short, straight hair that feels hard to the touch. The hard topcoat and dense undercoat provide weather resistance for a dog that was bred to work outdoors in all conditions. The hair is slightly longer around the neck, forming a sort of mini-mane.The coat is typically fawn- to mahogany-colored with a black mask on the face, black ears, and black tips on the hairs. Fawn-colored Malinois sometimes have a tiny bit of white on the tips of their toes or a small white spot on the chest.The short, smooth coat of the Malinois is easy to groom. Brush it weekly with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when necessary. Malinois shed year-round, more heavily in the spring and fall.Brush your Malinois" teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Malinois enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Malinois to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Well-socialized Malinois are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, but because of their herding heritage they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing. You must teach your Malinois that this behavior is unacceptable. An adult Malinois who"s unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Malinois can be aggressive toward other dogs and cats unless they"re brought up with them from puppyhood. If you want your Malinois to get along with other animals you must start early and reward them for appropriate behavior. If your Malinois hasn"t been socialized to other animals, it"s your responsibility to keep him under control in their presence.

The Belgian Sheepdog (known as the Groenendael in Europe) is the solid-colored variety of the four Belgian shepherd dogs. Elegant and graceful, he has a long black coat and an imposing appearance. He"s athletic as well as beautiful and maintains the working ability for which he was originally known, making him an excellent choice for agility, herding, and obedience competitions. The Belgian Sheepdog combines the versatility of a working dog with the gentleness of a family companion. He makes a wonderful family companion as long as he receives the exercise he needs. Of all the traits this breed has, energy is at the top of the list of what to consider before you purchase. The Belgian Sheepdog is not a breed that enjoys lazing around the house; he"s a working dog and needs a job to do. Herding dogs such as the Belgian Sheepdog are hard-wired to chase after a flock of sheep all day long. That instinct doesn"t disappear just because they"re living in a family home instead. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise per day. The Belgian Sheepdog is very intelligent and needs variety to keep from becoming bored. He"s not a good choice for people who work long hours and have no way of exercising their dog during the day. If he"s left to his own devices, he"s likely to create his own entertainment — generally something you won"t like that will be expensive to repair — or to develop separation anxiety. They do better in homes with a fenced yard. Their herding heritage makes Belgian Sheepdogs chasers, and they"ll take off after joggers, bicyclists, and cars if they aren"t contained by a fence. Loving and loyal, the Belgian Sheepdog will always protect "his" children, but it"s important for parents to supervise play when neighboring children are around. The Belgian may mistake the noise and high spirits of play as an assault and try to nip at your child"s friends. With proper supervision and corrections, you can teach him that this isn"t appropriate behavior. Belgian Sheepdogs do best with children when they"re raised with them from puppyhood or socialized to them at an early age. They can get along well with other dogs and cats if they"re brought up with them, although they may have issues with strange animals that come onto their property. They love to chase — that herding instinct again! — so cats who stand their ground will probably fare better than those who turn tail and run. This versatile dog has many excellent characteristics, but he"s probably not suited to a first-time dog owner. He"s loving, loyal, and energetic, but can also be shy, sensitive, and strong-willed. When you put time and effort and energy into him, however, he"s well worth all your work.
Shyness can be a problem in this breed. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one beating up his littermates or the one hiding in the corner. Belgian Sheepdogs require at least an hour of exercise per day. If you don"t provide them with exercise and mental stimulation in the form of training or play, they"ll find their own entertainment, and chances are it will be expensive to repair. Belgian Sheepdogs shed year-round and require 15 to 20 minutes of brushing weekly. Belgian Sheepdogs can get along well with other dogs and cats if they"re raised with them, but they have a chase instinct and will go after animals that run from them. Belgian Sheepdogs will chase joggers, bicyclists, and cars, so they need a securely fenced yard. Belgian Sheepdogs are very intelligent and alert. They also have strong herding and protection instincts. Early, consistent training is critical! Although they are good-size dogs, they are very people-oriented and want to be included in family activities. Belgian Sheepdogs are play-oriented and sensitive. Keep training sessions fun, consistent, and positive. Because of their intelligence, high energy levels, and other characteristics, Belgian Sheepdogs are not recommended for inexperienced dog owners. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Belgian Sheepdog is one of four varieties of shepherd dogs that were developed in Belgium in the late 1800s. The four varieties are the Malinois (fawn-mahogany, short coat with black mask), Tervuren (fawn-mahogany, long coat with black mask) the Laekenois (fawn, rough coat), and the Belgian Sheepdog, or Groenendael (black, long coat). The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes all but the Laekenois as separate breeds in the U.S., while the United Kennel Club recognizes all four types as one. The Club du Chien de Berger Belge (Belgian Shepherd Dog Club) was formed in September 1891 to determine which of the many different types of dogs was representative only of the shepherd dogs developed in Belgium. In November of that same year, breeders and fanciers met on the outskirts of Brussels to examine shepherd dogs from that area. After much deliberation, veterinary professor Adolphe Reul and a panel of judges concluded that the native shepherd dog of that province were square, medium-size dogs with well-set triangular ears and very dark brown eyes and differed only in the texture, color, and length of hair. Subsequent examinations of dogs in other Belgian provinces resulted in similar findings. The black-coated Belgian Sheepdog was developed primarily by breeder Nicolas Rose, whose kennel dates to 1893. The breed takes its European name from Rose"s estate, Chateau Groenendael, outside Brussels. He purchased the breed"s foundation dogs, Picard d"Uccle and Petite, and their offspring are the ancestors of today"s Belgian Sheepdogs. The dogs were immediately popular for their versatility and were used as police dogs in Paris and New York in the early 1900s. In Belgium, customs officers patrolled the border with them. During World War I, they carried messages and pulled ambulance and machine gun carts. Their popularity in the United States increased after the war, and the Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in 1919. The Depression era took a toll on their numbers, but they served as war dogs in World War II, and interest in them has gradually increased since that time. Today they excel in canine performance sports and rank 122nd among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
The Belgian Sheepdog male stands 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder and weighs 65 to 75 pounds, females 22 to 24 inches and 60 to 70 pounds.
The ideal Belgian Sheepdog is smart, brave, alert, and devoted to his family. He"s described as always in motion when not under command. His observation skills make him an excellent watchdog, but his herding heritage makes him naturally distrustful of strangers. If he isn"t properly trained and socialized this distrust can lead to aggressive behavior. A well-socialized and trained Belgian Sheepdog is a confident protector of his people and property and doesn"t attack without cause. He"s affectionate and friendly with people he knows, especially family members. He"s also demanding of their time and attention. This breed does not like to be left alone; he wants to be doing things with the family. He requires plenty of mental stimulation in the form of training and play, especially with puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes, as well as interactive play such as fetch games. This ideal Belgian Sheepdog temperament doesn"t just happen. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Excessive shyness can be a problem in this breed, so never choose a fearful puppy, even if he elicits protective feelings from you. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Belgian Sheepdogs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Belgian Sheepdog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Belgian Sheepdogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Belgian Sheepdogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Belgian Sheepdogs , you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Epilepsy: The Belgian Sheepdog can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Belgian Sheepdog has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. It is not thought to be widespread in Belgian Sheepdogs. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. The eye clearance the breeder shows you should be dated within the past year. Cancer: Dogs like humans can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy and some are treated both surgically and medically. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Some Belgian Sheepdogs appear to be sensitive to anesthesia. It is important to alert your veterinarian to this possibility so he or she can follow the same anesthetic protocols that are used with sighthounds, including a pre-anesthesia physical exam and lab work, obtaining a current weight, careful administration of anesthesia, and monitoring the dog"s vital signs during and after surgery. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.
The Belgian Sheepdog is an indoor/outdoor dog. He should live indoors with the family but needs access to a securely fenced yard that will prevent him from escaping to chase passing cyclists, joggers, and cars. If possible, provide your Belgian Sheepdog with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. He needs at least an hour of activity daily, which can be broken up into two or three exercise or play sessions. He enjoys playing Frisbee and other retrieving games. If you like to hike or jog, your Belgian Sheepdog will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience, tracking, or agility. It doesn"t really matter what you do as long as you keep him busy. Don"t be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it"s a remnant of his herding heritage. Introduce puppies to exercise gradually. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes, daily half-mile walks, plus playtime in the yard will meet their needs. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes twice a day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Belgian Sheepdog pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. While the Belgian Sheepdog is smart and highly trainable, he is an independent thinker. To succeed in training him, you"ll need to earn his trust and respect without the use of anger, intimidation, or physical force. For all his confidence and strength, the Belgian Sheepdog is sensitive, and his temperament can be damaged, sometimes irreparably, by harsh corrections. He does best with a combination of firm, fair, consistent rules and rewards for correct behavior.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Belgian Sheepdog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog .
The Belgian Sheepdog is a double-coated breed. The topcoat is abundant with long, straight hair that"s moderately harsh to the touch, never wiry or silky. The soft, dense undercoat provides protection from the weather and varies in thickness depending on the climate in which the Belgian Sheepdog lives. The hair is short on the head, outside the ears, and on the front part of the legs. Tufts of hair protect the opening of the ear. The hair on the rest of the body is long and includes long and abundant hair — called a collarette — around the neck, which is most noticeable in males; a fringe of long hair running down the back of the front legs and back of the thighs, and long, heavy, abundant hair on the tail. As in most species, the male is more ornamental than the female. The ideal Belgian Sheepdog is completely black or black with a bit of white between the pads of the feet, on the tips of the hind toes, or a small patch or strip on the forechest. You may also see a bit of frost on the chin or muzzle. White on the tips of the front toes is considered a fault according to the breed standard, but of course it doesn"t affect the Belgian Sheepdog"s abilities as a companion or working dog. Expect to spend 15 to 20 minutes per week brushing out that coat to remove dead hair and prevent mats or tangles. If you do this, you shouldn"t have a lot of loose hair flying around your house, especially if you supplement the weekly brushing with a quick daily brushing of a minute or two. Grooming tools that will come in handy include a medium-size pin brush for long hair, a wire slicker brush for use on puppies and on areas of the body with shorter hair, a grooming rake for removing shedding hair, and a mat comb for removing the occasional mat that forms behind the ears or in the areas where the legs join the body. Like most double-coated dogs, Belgian Sheepdogs shed year-round with at least one heavy shed per year depending on the climate in which they live and how much coat they have. To get the shedding period over with more quickly, give a warm bath or two to help release the coat and brush more frequently. Some people save the fur and have it spun into yarn and made into sweaters or other items of clothing. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Belgian Sheepdog"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Belgian Sheepdog enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Belgian Sheepdog to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Well-socialized Belgian Sheepdogs are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, but because of their herding heritage they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing. You must teach your Belgian Sheepdog that this behavior is unacceptable. An adult Belgian Sheepdog who is unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Belgian Sheepdogs get along best with other dogs and cats when they"re brought up with them from puppyhood. Sometimes they become best friends with cats and other animals and will protect them as they would members of their flock, and sometimes they all come to an agreement of mutual indifference. Belgian Sheepdogs can be aggressive toward other animals who aren"t part of their family. If you want your Belgian Sheepdog to get along with other animals you must start early and reward them for appropriate behavior. If your Belgian Sheepdog hasn"t been socialized to other animals, it"s your responsibility to keep him under control in their presence.
Belgian Sheepdogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Belgian Sheepdog in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Belgian Sheepdog rescue.

The four Belgian herding breeds are all similar in type, but each sports a distinctive look. The Belgian Tervuren is a beautiful, medium-size dog with a long, rich fawn to russet mahogany coat superimposed with a blanket of black, giving the Terv a striking appearance. He has the same athletic body and seemingly endless well of energy that characterizes all the Belgian shepherd breeds. The Terv is a charmer, noted for his intelligence, elegance, alertness, and sense of humor. He stands his ground in the face of strangers, sure of his ability to protect his people and property. With his own family, he"s affectionate and demanding of their time and attention. This is a dog who loves to be doing things with you. And he can do a lot of things. The Terv isn"t just a herding dog anymore. He does police work, is an accomplished assistance dog and therapy dog, and participates in any number of dog sports, from herding — natch! — to agility, obedience, sledding (yes, sledding), and tracking. The breed standard — the written description of how a dog should look and act — says a Tervuren is usually in motion when not under command. Take that description to heart if you are considering a Terv! The Belgian Tervuren is not typically recommended for people who are inexperienced with dogs. His temperament and activity level can be overwhelming to people who haven"t had a working dog before. Herding dogs such as the Tervuren are hard-wired to chase after a flock of sheep all day long. That instinct doesn"t disappear just because they"re living in a family home instead. The Terv requires a good hour of exercise each day and enough mental stimulation to keep him from being bored. If he"s left to his own devices all day, he"s likely to create his own entertainment — generally something you won"t like that will be expensive to repair — or to develop separation anxiety. While the Terv is smart and highly trainable, he is an independent thinker. To succeed in training him, you"ll need to earn his trust and respect without the use of anger, intimidation, or physical force. For all his confidence and strength, the Tervuren is sensitive, and his temperament can be damaged, sometimes irreparably, by harsh corrections. He does best with a combination of firm, fair, consistent rules and rewards for correct behavior. Tervs are devoted to their families, including children, but they"re more interested in hanging with the adults. They can get along well with other dogs and cats if they"re brought up with them, although they may have issues with strange animals that come onto their property. They love to chase — that herding instinct, again! — so cats who stand their ground will probably fare better than those who turn tail and run. That desire to chase also puts passing joggers and cars at risk, so a fenced yard is necessary not only for the safety of others but also for the Terv"s own well-being. The Belgian Tervuren combines the beauty and grace of a show dog, the love, loyalty, and temperament of a companion dog, and the energy, athleticism, and intelligence of a herding dog to create a breed that can truly do it all. If you are a highly active and experienced dog owner and would like a canine partner for jogging, hiking, dog sports, or other activities, the Terv is one to consider.
Shyness can be a problem in this breed. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one beating up his littermates or the one hiding in the corner. Belgian Tervuren require at least an hour of exercise per day. If you don"t provide them with exercise and mental stimulation in the form of training or play, they"ll find their own entertainment, and chances are it will be expensive to repair. Belgian Tervuren shed year-round and require 15 to 20 minutes of brushing weekly. Tervs can get along well with other dogs and cats if they"re raised with them, but they have a chase instinct and will go after animals that run from them. Belgian Tervuren will chase joggers, bicyclists, and cars, so they need a securely fenced yard. Tervuren are very intelligent and alert. They also have strong herding and protection instincts. Early, consistent training is critical! Although they are good-size dogs, they are very people-oriented and want to be included in family activities. Belgian Tervuren are play-oriented and sensitive. Keep training sessions fun, consistent, and positive. Because of their intelligence, high energy, and other characteristics, Tervuren are not recommended for inexperienced dog owners. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Belgian Tervuren is one of four varieties of shepherd dogs that were developed in Belgium in the late 1800s. The four varieties are the Malinois (fawn-mahogany, short coat with black mask), Tervuren (fawn-mahogany, long coat with black mask) the Laekenois (fawn, rough coat), and the Groenendael (black, long coat). The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes all but the Laekenois as separate breeds in the U.S., while the United Kennel Club recognizes all four types as one. The Club du Chien de Berger Belge (Belgian Shepherd Dog Club) was formed in September 1891 to determine which of the many different types of dogs was representative only of the shepherd dogs developed in Belgium. In November of that same year, breeders and fanciers met on the outskirts of Brussels to examine shepherd dogs from that area. After much deliberation, veterinary professor Adolphe Reul and a panel of judges concluded that the native shepherd dog of that province were square, medium-size dogs with well-set triangular ears and very dark brown eyes and differed only in the texture, color, and length of hair. Subsequent examinations of dogs in other Belgian provinces resulted in similar findings. In 1892, Professor Reul wrote the first Belgian Shepherd Dog standard, which recognized three varieties: dogs with long coats, dogs with short coats, and dogs with rough coats. That same year, the first show for Belgian Shepherd dogs took place in Cureghem, Belgium, and the winner was a Tervuren named Duc II. The Club du Chien de Berger Belge asked the Societe Royale Saint-Hubert (Belgium"s equivalent to the American Kennel Club) for breed status, but was denied. By 1901, however, the Belgian Shepherd Dog, encompassing the four varieties, was finally recognized as a breed. Breeders decided to give each of the different varieties of Belgian Shepherd Dogs their own names. Tervuren take their name from a Belgian village that was home to M. F. Corbeel, who bred Tom and Poes, fawn-colored dogs who are considered the foundation of the Tervuren breed. Belgian Shepherds were also used as guard dogs and draught dogs. They were the first dogs to be used by the Belgian police. Before World War II, international police dog trials became very popular in Europe, and Belgian dogs earned a number of prizes at the trials. When World War I broke out, many Belgian Shepherd Dogs were used by the military for a number of jobs including messenger dogs, Red Cross dogs, ambulance cart dogs and, according to some, light machine-gun cart dogs. A few Tervuren made it to the United States, but the breed didn"t catch on and had disappeared in this country by the 1930s. It wasn"t until 1953 that more Tervuren were imported for American breeding programs. In 1959 the AKC declared them a separate breed from the other Belgian Sheepdogs, and the American Belgian Tervuren Club was formed in 1960. Since then the Terv"s elegance has made him a popular show dog and his working ability has made him a talented herding dog. He ranks 107th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
A male Belgian Tervuren stands 23 to 26.5 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 55 to 70 pounds; a female is 21 to 24.5 inches tall and weighs 40 to 55 pounds.
A proper Belgian Tervuren is observant and vigilant, making him an excellent watchdog. A Terv is a confident protector of his people and property and doesn"t attack without cause. He"s affectionate and friendly with people he knows, especially family members. He"s also demanding of their time and attention. This breed does not like to be left alone; he wants to be doing things with the family. He requires plenty of mental stimulation in the form of training and play, especially with puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes, as well as interactive play such as fetch games. But that typical Tervuren temperament doesn"t just happen. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Excessive shyness can be a problem in this breed, so never choose a fearful puppy, even if he elicits protective feelings from you. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Tervuren need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tervuren puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Belgian Tervurens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Belgian Tervurens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In TKs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. It is not thought to be widespread in Belgian Tervuren. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. The eye clearance the breeder shows you should be dated within the past year. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Epilepsy: The Belgian Tervuren can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Belgian Tervuren has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
The Belgian Tervuren is an indoor/outdoor dog. He should live indoors with the family but needs access to a securely fenced yard that will prevent him from escaping to chase passing cyclists, joggers, and cars. If possible, provide your Belgian Tervuren with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging.

Don"t be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it"s a remnant of his herding heritage. Introduce puppies to exercise gradually. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization; add 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Terv pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Belgian Tervuren are sensitive and highly trainable. Be firm, calm, and consistent with them. Anger and physical force are counterproductive. Use positive training techniques, rewarding them with praise, play, or treats when they perform commands correctly or do anything you like — even if you didn"t ask them to.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.

The Belgian Tervuren is a double-coated breed. The topcoat is abundant with long, straight hair that"s moderately harsh to the touch, never wiry or silky.

The hair is short on the head, outside the ears, and on the front part of the legs. Tufts of hair protect the opening of the ear. The hair on the rest of the body is long and includes sort of a mini-mane — called a collarette — around the neck, which is most noticeable in males; and a fringe of long hair down the back of the front legs and back of the thighs and on the tail. As in most species, the male is more ornamental than the female. The strong, rich color of the Belgian Tervuren coat ranges from fawn to russet mahogany with a black overlay. The lighter guard hairs are tipped with black. The chest is black or black and gray, the face has a black mask, the ears are black, and the tail usually has a dark or black tip. It"s normal for Belgian Tervuren, especially males, to become darker with age, usually on the shoulders, back, and rib area. In either sex, a good coat never looks washed out or appears predominantly cream or gray in color, although you"ll find cream, light beige, or gray on the underside of the tail, body, and back of the thighs. The tips of the toes may be white. Like most double-coated dogs, Tervs shed year-round. Males usually have one heavy shed per year, while females shed between each heat cycle. Expect to spend 15 to 20 minutes per week brushing out that coat to remove dead hair and prevent mats or tangles. If you do this, you shouldn"t have a lot of loose hair flying around your house, especially if you supplement the weekly brushing with a quick daily brushing of a minute or two. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Terv"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it.

If you want your Terv to get along with other animals you must start early and reward them for appropriate behavior. If your Terv hasn"t been socialized to other animals, it"s your responsibility to keep him under control in their presence.

With a name like this — pronounced bare ZHAY pee CARR — you"ve got to be good. The oldest of the French sheepdogs, the Berger Picard is believed to have arrived in France with the Celts sometime around 800 A.D. The breed has been depicted for centuries in tapestries, engravings, and woodcuts, but these days he"s a movie star, appearing in such flicks as "Because of Winn Dixie," "Daniel and the Superdogs," and "Are We Done Yet?"This medium-size dog with the prick ears and thick eyebrows has a lively, intelligent personality. They endear themselves with their humanlike gaze and goofy grins and stand out as resilient playmates for kids. Thanks to their intelligence, they respond well to training, although they can occasionally be stubborn. They"re sensitive to your tone of voice, so even if you get impatient, try to give commands cheerfully — it generally works best.They usually get along fine with cats and other small pets in the household if they were raised with them. Some Berger Picards can be barky, something to consider if you"ve got nearby neighbors. Like other dogs bred to do a physically demanding job — in this case, herding sheep and cattle — Berger Picards need daily exercise, and can grow bored or destructive without it.The population of Berger Picards was devestated by World Wars I and II, and they remain rare. Today there are only about 3500 Berger Picards in France.

Dog Breed Group:  Mixed Breed DogsHeight:  From 10 to 29 inches tall at the shoulder, as sizes vary from tiny to standardWeight:  From 10 to 90 poundsLife Span:  12 to 18 years. Tiny Bernedoodles tend to live longer than standard.
The Bernedoodle is a companion dog, through and through. The breed inherits the intelligence of its Poodle parents and the charming, goofy, happy-go-lucky temperament of the Bernese Mountain Dog. Bernedoodles are happiest when they"re spending time with their families, children included, and are willing participants in playtime and cuddle fests alike.The breed hasn"t been around for long, so it may be difficult to accurately make predictions about individual dogs. Sometimes they get more Poodle traits, and other times they more closely resemble the Bernese. That said, fans of Bernedoodles adore their friendliness, playfulness, intelligence, and affection. They also tend to be more hypoallergenic, which is a blessing for allergy sufferers.In addition to their personalities, Bernedoodles can differ in appearance. Their coats can be curly and wavy or straight and come in a variety of colors. They come in three sizes; tiny, miniature, and standard. These sizes are determined by the size of the Poodle parent, which can be toy, mini, or standard.Bernedoodles are fairly adaptable and go with the flow. Smaller sized Bernedoodles make better apartment pets than Standard Bernedoodles, who do best with a yard to burn off energy. This breed has moderate exercise needs that are usually met with at least one long daily walk.If you need a dog for the whole family, or if you"re a single owner looking for a lovable, smart mixed-breed with good health that will put a smile on your face with their antics, you won"t be able to find a much better choice than the Bernedoodle.
Because they are a mixed breed, Bernedoodles tend to have fewer health problems than either Poodles or Bernese Mountain Dogs. Breeding of Bernedoodles began in 2003 with the sole purpose of creating a great companion dog, not a dog that would perform well in shows or just look cute. They may be stubborn as puppies, but that usually fades with age, and their intelligence makes them very trainable for patient owners. Bernedoodles are usually hypoallergenic and shed very little. Though they are generally good with children and other dogs, early socialization is always helpful in making sure they stay calm and comfortable in new situations. Bernedoodles can vary greatly in appearance depending on which traits they receive from each parent. They are equally happy playing outside as they are cuddling up with their favorite humans. Bernedoodles crave attention and are best suited to a home where they are not left alone for long periods of time.
The Bernedoodle is a relatively new breed. Sherry Rupke of Swissridge Kennels is the breeder who claims to be the first to intentionally breed Poodles and Bernese Mountain Dogs to create the Bernedoodle in 2003, though a hybrid of those dogs may have "accidentally" existed before then.Being a relatively new breed and a hybrid of two purebreds, the Bernedoodle is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, though it is recognized by the American Canine Hybrid Club, the Designer Dogs Kennel Club, the International Designer Canine Registry, and the Designer Breed Registry.While this is considered a designer breed, they do appear in shelters, and rescue groups that focus on Poodles and Bernese Mountain Dogs will sometimes work with mixes of those breeds. There is no reason that you have to rely on a breeder for a Bernedoodle, and you should always adopt before shopping. You can even check our searchable database of adoptable dogs here. Even if you don"t find the exact dog breed you want, you"ll definitely find a pup that you can fall in love with.
There are three sizes of Bernedoodle: tiny, miniature, and standard. These result from the size of the Poodle parent, which can be toy, mini, or standard size. The Tiny Bernedoodle stands at 12 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 10 to 24 pounds. The Miniature Bernedoodle stands at 18 to 22 inches tall and weighs 25 to 49 pounds. The Standard Bernedoodle stands at 23 to 29 inches and weigh 70 to 90 pounds. Males are generally larger than females.
Bernedoodles seem to get many of the best personality traits from the Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle breeds. Exactly which traits they inherit from their parents can differ a bit, though, and individual personalities of dogs within the breed vary. Bernedoodles tend to be highly intelligent, hardworking when necessary, loyal, and just a bit goofy. They are good with children and other dogs, provided they have been well socialized.Some Bernedoodles inherit the Bernese Mountain Dog"s stubbornness, which may make them difficult to train, however this trait tends to fade away as puppies become adolescent dogs. Once they begin training, their intelligence helps them pick up commands more easily than other dogs. Bernedoodles may also inherit the Bernese"s apprehension around strangers, so socialization is important, especially at a young age.Bernedoodles can have high energy levels and crave attention and at least moderate exercise. They do best in homes where they are not left alone for long periods of time. Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles do better with apartment and city life than Standard Bernedoodles. They"ll need at least a nice, long daily walk to burn off energy. Generally, they want nothing more than to be with their humans and are just as ready to go outside and play with them as they are to join them on the couch for cuddles.
Bernedoodles tend to be healthier dogs than either of their parents. Inbreeding has left many purebred dogs open to genetically inherited diseases and conditions, but cross-breeding reduces that risk. Because the breed hasn"t been around for very long, information about health concerns for Bernedoodles is somewhat limited. The instances of cancer in the Bernedoodle seem to be lower than those of the Bernese Mountain Dog.There are, however, some conditions that Bernedoodles may be predisposed to, including hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, eye problems, and skin issues such as allergies and hot spots. All breeds may be affected by any number of health concerns, but the Bernedoodle is generally a healthy breed.
Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles are more suited to apartment life, while Standard Bernedoodles do better with a nice yard to run around. Generally, this breed doesn"t require much personal space, and as long as their moderate needs for physical and mental stimulation are met, they shouldn"t be too destructive. They love being around their humans, so the less time they spend alone, the better.Like Poodles, Bernedoodles are quite intelligent, which means they can learn bad habits just as easily as good ones. It is important to keep up with training. Early socialization and exposure to other dogs and humans is always a good idea and will help keep them well-behaved when meeting new people or pets.
The appropriate amount to feed a Bernedoodle depends on their size, age, and activity level, which means it is highly individualized. Standard Bernedoodles may be voracious eaters that will gulp down whatever you put in front of them, so you"ll have to take care to monitor their food intake and weight while providing them with plenty of physical activity. You should ask your veterinarian for dietary recommendations that suit your particular dog.
Bernedoodle coats can vary and look more Poodle-like or more closely resemble the Bernese Mountain Dog. Usually they have wavy, curly coats that don"t shed much, which can help make them more suitable for people with allergies to dander. Sometimes Bernedoodles can have straighter coats, which shed more and are less hypoallergenic. The thickness of their coat helps this breed thrive in cool temperatures while providing them a fair amount of protection from the heat of summer months, as well.The color of Bernedoodle coats have quite a range. Some are pure black, others are black and white, and others are black and brown. Sometimes Bernedoodles are tri-colored with patches of black, white, and brown. They may even have other colors, as well. The most popular coat colors and markings for people seeking a Bernedoodle tend to resemble the tri-colored Bernese Mountain Dog.The curlier the Bernedoodle"s coat is, the harder it is to groom. Because they shed less, they need to be brushed more often to prevent their coat from getting matted. Some Bernedoodle owners brush their dog"s coat daily and treat it as a bonding experience, which this breed tends to love. Their coat must also be trimmed every few months, depending on how quickly it grows.
Bernedoodles are excellent for families with children, though it is always important to make sure children are instructed on how to properly treat animals, especially with Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles that may be injured more easily. This breed is affectionate and loves to play, and they absolutely adore spending time with their families.Bernedoodles usually do well with other dogs, but it is important to begin socialization at an early age and keep up with it to make sure they are comfortable around new animals.

Dog Breed Group:  Working DogsHeight:  1 foot, 11 inches to 2 feet, 3 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  70 to 115 poundsLife Span:  6 to 8 years
The Bernese Mountain Dog, affectionately called the Berner (and known as the Berner Sennenhund in his Swiss homeland), is instantly recognizable with his flashy, tricolor coat and white "Swiss cross" on his chest. Underneath that beautiful coat is a sturdy dog well suited for heavy work: These beautiful, gentle dogs have been traditionally used in Switzerland as herders and draft dogs. The Berner was originally a vital part of farm life, serving to drive cattle, protect his family, and pull carts loaded with goods to sell at nearby villages. Although he"s a good-mannered, hard worker, he nearly became extinct in the early 20th century, when other means of transportation became accessible to farmers. Fortunately, a handful of fanciers sought to preserve the breed. In addition to being strikingly good-looking, the Berner has a wonderful temperament. He is known for being loyal, affectionate, eager to please, and intelligent. He"s easy to train, if you allow him time to analyze what you want him to do. Most of all, he has a happy-go-lucky attitude about life. The Berner is calm but gregarious, and sometimes even a little goofy when he plays with his family. He does well with children of all ages and with adults, but he isn"t a good choice for people who live in apartments or don"t have a large, fenced yard for him to play in. The Berner needs to live with his family, rather than be relegated to an outdoor kennel. He"s happiest when he can participate in all family activities. Since he was bred to be a working dog, the Berner likes to learn and can be easily trained. Since he is very large — about 100 pounds — when mature, early obedience training and socialization are recommended. Prospective owners should know that the Berner is slow to mature, both physically and mentally; he may remain puppyish for some time. Additionally, the Berner is known to have a "soft" personality; his feelings are easily hurt and he doesn"t respond well to harsh corrections. Despite his beauty and excellent temperament — or perhaps because of these qualities — Berners are struggling to survive today. The breed has a small gene pool, which has resulted in numerous health problems related to inbreeding. As more people find out about the breed, many dogs with health problems are being bred with little or no regard to the effect this has on the breed as a whole. Those considering a Bernese Mountain Dog must be very careful to buy a puppy only from a reputable breeder.    
Berners have numerous health problems due to their small genetic foundation, and perhaps due to other reasons yet undiscovered. Currently, the life span of a Bernese Mountain Dog is comparatively short, about six to eight years. Because of the Berner"s popularity, some people have bred dogs of lesser quality in order to sell the puppies to unsuspecting buyers. Be especially careful about importing dogs from foreign countries that have few laws governing kennel conditions. Often these dogs are bought at auction and little is known about their health history. Veterinary care can be costly because of the health problems in the breed. Berners shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. If shedding drives you crazy, this may not be the right breed for you. The Berner likes to be with his family. He"s likely to develop annoying behavior problems, such as barking, digging, or chewing, if he"s isolated from people and their activities. When Berners are mature, they are large dogs who like to have a job to do. For those reasons, it"s wise — and fun — to begin obedience training early. Although they"re very gentle with children, Berners sometimes accidentally knock over a small child or toddler. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
One ancient breed, the Molosser, stands out as of the most versatile, well traveled, and influential in the development of a variety of Mastiff-type dogs, including Berners. It"s thought that the four Swiss Sennenhund breeds (Appenzeller Sennenhund, Entlebucher Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, and Berner Sennenhund) developed as crosses between farm dogs from the Swiss Alps and the Molosser or Mastiff-type dogs that the Romans brought with them when they invaded the Alps in the first century B.C. It"s likely that the Berner has been working on Swiss farms for more than 2,000 years, quietly tucked away on small holdings in the Alps, where he"s been pulling carts, accompanying livestock, standing watch, and providing his owners with loyal companionship. It is known that by 1888, only 36 percent of the Swiss population worked in agriculture, and need dwindled for a strong dog who could herd cattle and pull a cart filled with goods. In 1899, however, the Swiss became interested in preserving their native breeds and founded a dog club called Berna. Members included breeders of a variety of purebred dogs. In 1902, the Swiss dog club sponsored a show at Ostermundigen that drew attention to the Swiss mountain breeds. Two years later, the breeds took a big step forward through several events: At an international dog show held in Bern, the Swiss dog club sponsored a class for Swiss "shepherd dogs," which included the Mountain dogs. This was also the first year that these dogs were referred to as "Bernese." And in that same year, the Swiss Kennel Club recognized the Bernese Mountain Dog as a breed. During World War I, dog shows and breeding took a backseat to war efforts. But after the war, the first Bernese Mountain Dogs were exported, first to Holland and then to the United States — although the breed was not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, two British breeders began importing Berners, and the first litter of Berner pups was born in England. Also in 1936, the Glen Shadow kennel in Louisiana imported a female and a male Berner from Switzerland. By early 1937, the AKC sent Glen Shadow a letter saying that the Bernese Mountain Dog had been accepted as a new breed in the Working Class. World War II again interrupted the progress of the breed outside its native land, but after 1945, importation and registration resumed in the United States. In 1968, the Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America was founded, with 62 members and 43 registered Berners. Three years later, there were more than 100 members in the club. Meanwhile, the breed, which had died out in England during World War II, was reintroduced in Great Britain. The Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America became a member club of the AKC in 1981. In 1990, the AKC adopted its current Bernese Mountain Dog standard.
Males stand 25 to 27.5 inches tall and weigh 80 to 115 pounds. Females stand 23 to 26 inches tall and weigh 70 to 95 pounds.
The Berner is an affectionate, intelligent, and alert dog. He"s also gentle, calm, and tolerant. He likes to be with his family and thrives when he"s included in family activities. His large size is one of his most notable features, and of course early training is essential to teach him how to behave properly in the house and with people. Slow to mature, he reaches his adult size long before he reaches mental maturity. The Berner is protective of his family, though he isn"t usually aggressive. He can be aloof with strangers and generally a bit shy, so exposing the Berner puppy to a wide variety of people, animals, and situations is important. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Berner needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Berner puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Berners are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Berners will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Berners, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cancer: Various forms of cancer afflict a large number of Bernese Mountain Dogs and can cause early death. Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that don"t heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease common to large-breed dogs. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is a congenital abnormality in which blood vessels allow blood to bypass the liver. As a result, the blood is not cleansed by the liver as it should be. Symptoms, which usually appear before two years of age, can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Surgery is usually the best option. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Panosteitis: Commonly called pano, this condition causes self-limiting lameness. At about five to 12 months of age, the dog may start to limp first on one leg, then on another — then the limping will stop. There are usually no long-term effects. Rest and restricted activity may be necessary for a while if the dog is in pain. The best thing that you can do for your Berner is to feed him a high-quality dog food that doesn"t have too much calcium or too high a percentage of protein, which some believe may cause pano. Ask your vet for his recommendations. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bernese Mountain Dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.
Berners are not suited to apartment or condo life. A home with a large, securely fenced yard is the best choice. Because the Berner is a working dog, he has plenty of energy. In addition to yard play, he needs a minimum of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise every day; three times that amount keeps this sturdy dog in top condition. With his thick, handsome coat, the Berner is a natural fit for cold climates. He loves to play in the snow. Conversely, with his black coat and large size, he"s prone to heat stroke. Don"t allow him to exercise strenuously when it"s extremely hot; limit exercise to early mornings or evenings, when it"s cooler. Keep him cool during the heat of the day, either inside with fans or air-conditioning or outside in the shade. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Berner puppy. Like many large-breed dogs, Berners grow rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. Additionally, don"t let the Berner puppy run and play on hard surfaces (such as pavement), jump excessively, or pull heavy loads until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Berner in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Berner puppies need slow, steady growth. Choose a good-quality food that"s 22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat. For more on feeding your Berner, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Berner coat is gorgeous: a thick double coat with a longer outer coat and a wooly undercoat. Characteristically tricolored, the majority of the Berner"s body is covered with jet-black hair with rich rust and bright white. There"s usually a white marking on his chest that looks like an inverted cross, a white blaze between the eyes, and white on the tip of his tail. Beauty has a price, though, and in this case it"s that the Berner is a shedder. He sheds moderately all year and heavily in the spring and fall. Brushing several times a week helps reduce the amount of hair around the house and keeps the coat clean and tangle-free. Periodic bathing, every three months or so, will maintain his neat appearance. Brush your Berner"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Berner to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Berner is an excellent family pet, and he"s usually gentle and affectionate with children who are kind and careful with animals. Being so large, he can inadvertently bump or knock over very young or small children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Berner gets along with other pets well, though the greater the size difference, the more supervision and training required to keep everyone safe.
Berners are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Berners in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Berners rescue. Bernese Mountain Dog Club of America

With compact bodies, baby-doll faces, and fluffy white hair, Bichons are a very appealing breed whose looks are enhanced by a perky, good-natured disposition. They are often mistaken for white Poodles. The Bichon, as he"s affectionately called, is related to several small breeds: the Coton de Tulear, a dog who originated off the African coast on an island near Madagascar; the Bolognese, bred in northern Italy near the city of Bologna; the Havanese, from Cuba; and the Maltese, developed on the island of Malta in the Mediterranean. Bichons also appear to have originated in the Mediterranean and to have been taken along on trade routes into other countries. Bichons may be small dogs — large specimens reach barely a foot in height — but they"re hardy. Despite their diminutive size, they"re not classified as a Toy breed by the American Kennel Club; instead, they"re members of the Non-Sporting Group. Bichons are always white (although puppies may be cream or pale yellow), with black eyes and black noses. Their arched necks give them a proud, confident look, while their well-plumed tails curve gracefully over their backs. If you"re looking for a wonderful family pet, consider the Bichon. This dog loves to play. He"s always happy (except when left alone for long periods of time), and his demeanor is affectionate and gentle. Because they don"t shed like other breeds, Bichons often are recommended for people with allergies. This is something you should discuss with your allergist, since not everyone reacts the same way to a Bichon. Before making a commitment to getting a Bichon — or any type of dog — be sure to spend some time in the presence of the breed if you have allergies. Bichons have a reputation for suffering from separation anxiety. If you must leave your dog home alone for long periods of time, this may not be the dog for you. Bichons don"t just like to be with their families, they need to be with their families. They adjust well to a variety of lifestyles, as long as they don"t have to spend too much time alone. Because of their small size, Bichons are good pets for people who live in apartments. But they do have a lot of energy, and they need daily exercise, including walks and games. Bichons are intelligent and love to learn tricks, and they"re highly trainable. When training, you need to be firm but gentle. Harsh corrections and scolding will break a Bichon"s heart. Many Bichon owners train their dogs for obedience, agility, and rally competition. Both dogs and owners enjoy this activity, and it"s a good way to bond more closely with your Bichon. Another activity that brings out the best in the Bichon is therapy work. Because they"re gentle and sure to bring a smile to anyone"s face, they make perfect therapy dogs for visits in nursing homes and hospitals. Bichons generally get along well with other animals and people, but they will alert you when strangers come to the door.
Bichons can be difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended. Bichons don"t like to be left alone for long periods of time. Bichon Frise puppies are tiny and should only be handled by children under careful adult supervision. Bichons are intelligent and cunning. To help your Bichon be the best companion possible, obedience training is recommended. Grooming is a must! Be prepared to pay for professional grooming. Highly motivated owners can learn the technique, but it isn"t easy and requires a lot of time. Bichons can be prone to skin problems and allergies. Because they"re cute and small, you might be tempted to overprotect your Bichon Frise. This is a mistake and can lead to your dog becoming spoiled, shy, and fearful. Be watchful for dangerous situations, but teach your Bichon confidence by acting confident about his ability to cope with people, other animals, and situations. To get a healthy Bichon, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
As with many dog breeds, the exact origin of the Bichon Frise is uncertain. Common belief holds that the Bichon descended from the Barbet, a medium-sized, woolly water dog, and that the word Bichon is derived from barbichon, which is the diminutive of the word barbet. The Barbichon family of dogs includes the Bichon Frise, the Bolgnese, the Coton de Tulear, the Havanese, and the Maltese. All originated in the Mediterranean and have a similar look and disposition. The earliest records of the Bichon Frise breed date from the 14th century, when French sailors brought the dogs home from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. It"s thought that Bichon Frise dogs had been taken there by traders who used the Phoenician trade route, and that the Bichon Frise originally developed in Italy. Still other historians believe that Spanish seamen brought the breed to Tenerife and, in the 14th century, Italian (rather than French) sailors brought them back to the continent. According to this version of the story, when the French invaded Italy in the 1500s, they brought many Bichon Frise dogs back to France as war booty. Regardless of how the Bichon Frise arrived in Europe, the breed quickly became a great favorite with nobility. Bichons were popular in royal courts during the reigns of France"s King Francis I and England"s King Henry III in the 16th century. King Henry III was so fond of his Bichons that he carried them wherever he went in a special basket that he hung from his neck. Bichons became favorites of Spanish royal families and even of such painters as Goya, who included a Bichon in several of his paintings. Interest in the Bichon Frise remained strong during the rule of Napoleon III, but then the little dog fell out of favor with royalty until the late 1800s. By that time, it was considered a common dog, sometimes owned by organ grinders or circus performers and sometimes trained to help lead the blind. Had it not been for the Bichon"s intelligence and appeal, the breed probably would have become extinct during this period. After World War I, however, French breeders became interested in the Bichon and worked to preserve the breed. The official breed standard was adopted by the Société Centrale Canine of France on March 5, 1933, at which point the little dog had two names: Tenerife and Bichon. Later that same year, when the Bichon Frise was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (an international kennel club), the FCI president, Madame Nizet de Leemans, renamed the breed the Bichon à poil frisé ("Bichon with the curly coat"), and the moniker was anglicized to Bichon Frise. On October 18, 1934, the first Bichon Frise was admitted to the studbook of the French Kennel Club. Bichons Frises first were brought to the Untied States in 1956. The breed became eligible to enter the AKC"s Miscellaneous Class in September 1971 and was admitted to registration in the American Kennel Club Studbook in October 1972. In April 1973, the breed became eligible to show in the Non-Sporting Group at AKC dog shows. In 1975, the AKC recognized the Bichon Frise Club of America.
Males and females stand about 9 to 11 inches tall and weigh 7 to 12 pounds.
A cheerful attitude is the outstanding trait of the Bichon"s personality. This dog loves to be loved, enjoys being the center of attention, and is adept at charming his family, neighbors, groomer, or veterinarian with his winning personality. The Bichon has a playful, independent streak, but that doesn"t mean he likes to be alone. In fact, this breed hates being alone and commonly suffers from separation anxiety if left alone for many hours. In such situations, Bichons may become destructive, chewing and tearing up anything in sight. Obviously the Bichon is not a breed of choice for people who are away from home for long periods of time (indeed, no dog is). The highly intelligent Bichon needs to be taught proper canine manners, so it"s essential to sign up for obedience training, beginning with puppy classes. Bichons are quick studies, so taking them to such classes can be very satisfying. They"re also good at tricks and some canine sports. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Bichon needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bichon puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Bichons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bichons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bichons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Bladder Problems: Bladder stones and bladder infections: are not uncommon in this breed. Many factors can cause bladder stones, including excessive protein, magnesium, and phosphorus in the diet or long periods of time between urination. Bladder infections can be traced to bacterial or viral infections. If your Bichon needs to urinate frequently, has bloody urine, or seems to have difficulty urinating and loss of appetite, take him to the vet for a checkup. Allergies: Allergies can afflict Bichons due to several different causes, including contact allergies and food allergies. Bichons are well known for being sensitive to fleabites as well. If your Bichon is scratching, licking at his paws, or rubbing his face often, suspect that he has an allergy and have him checked by your vet. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Vaccination Sensitivity: Some Bichons are affected by this sensitivity, and many suffer even from routine vaccinations. Symptoms usually include hives, facial swelling, soreness, and lethargy. In rare instances, a vaccine-sensitive dog will develop complications or even die. Watch your Bichon carefully for a few hours after he"s been vaccinated, and call the vet if you notice anything unusual. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Juvenile Cataracts: Cataracts sometimes develop in relatively young (less than six years old) Bichons. This is thought to be hereditary. When buying a Bichon puppy, be sure to ask if the breeder her breeding stock is certified by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF), and ask to see the certificates yourself.
Bichons are active dogs but do well as apartment dwellers with proper exercise and play — and they live to play. Don"t leave your Bichon alone for long periods of time. To prevent destructive behavior, the wise owner leaves the Bichon in a crate when leaving the house for even a short time.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Bichon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Bichons, like many small breeds, are prone to urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract). Diet is an important part of treating and managing this condition; therapeutic diets and increased water intake can help prevent and control it. For more on feeding your Bichon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bichon Frise is a double-coated breed, always white. The soft and dense undercoat and course outer coat combine to create a soft but substantial texture. The coat stands away from the body, giving it a powder-puff appearance. The most popular trim for a Bichon follows the lines of the dog"s body, leaving the coat long enough to give him the signature "poufy" look. Bichons have a reputation for not shedding, which isn"t exactly true. All creatures with hair shed. With double-coated Bichons, however, the shed hair is caught up in the undercoat instead of falling to the floor. If this dead hair isn"t removed by brushing or combing, it can form mats and tangles, which can lead to skin problems if left unattended. Grooming a Bichon is not for cowards: this is a high-maintenance breed. You"ll need to allot considerable time for grooming and bathing: you should brush him at least twice a week or more, and you"ll need to bathe him whenever he gets dirty in order to keep that white coat clean. Be sure to make sure the coat is free of mats and tangles before bathing, or the mats will tighten and become nearly impossible to remove. You should check your Bichon"s ears often to make sure they"re clean. Sometimes it"s necessary to pluck out the hair that grows in the ear canal (which a groomer can do if you don"t feel comfortable with the job). If you notice a buildup of wax, redness, or a foul odor, or if you dog is scratching his ears and shaking his head, take him to the vet to be sure he doesn"t have an ear infection. Most Bichon owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every four to six weeks for a bath, brush, haircut, nail trimming, and ear cleaning. If you want to learn how to groom your Bichon yourself, check out the many good grooming books and videos on the market for instructions. Keeping a Bichon"s face clean and trimmed is important for health as well as looks. Mucus and discharge from the eyes tend to accumulate in the hair that grows around the eyes, and eye problems can result if you don"t clean the area regularly. Tearstains are common, as a result of eye problems or even food allergies. Because Bichons are prone to a number of eye diseases, it"s best to have your vet check your dog if tearstaining becomes a problem. Bichons are prone to blocked or small tear ducts, eyelashes that grow toward the eyeball, or eyelids that turn inward and cause the lashes to rub against the eye. Your vet will be able to determine if any of these conditions, or something else, is causing tearstains. Brush your Bichon"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Begin accustoming your Bichon to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Bichons are good family dogs and wonderful companions for children. They enjoy palling around with kids, joining in their games or sitting in their laps. They"re very tolerant of the noise and commotion associated with children. As with every breed, however, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Bichon enjoys the company of other dogs, as long as he receives his fair share of attention from his owner. With proper introductions and training, the Bichon can get along with cats and other animals.
Bichons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Bichons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Bichon rescue. Bichon Frise Club of America Rescue

One of America"s canine aristocrats, the Black and Tan Coonhound"s bloodlines hark back to the Talbot hound of a thousand years ago, yet he"s completely a creation of the mountain people of the Ozarks and the Smokies. Nose to the ground, he singlemindedly trails his prey, primarily the raccoon but also mountain lions, bears, deer, and other game, "barking up" when his quarry is treed. Of the six coonhound breeds, the Black and Tan is the one most frequently recognized, notable for his size and distinctive coloring. Among hunters, he"s famous for his cold nose; that is, the ability to pick up and follow an old trail, no matter how faint. Because of his strong hunting instinct and specialized skills, the Black and Tan Coonhound is rarely thought of as a family dog. Still, for people who admire the hound"s independent nature and sense of humor, he can make an excellent companion and at home he tends to be laidback, playful, and gentle. The stamina that makes this Hound a great hunting dog also makes him an excellent jogging or running companion. But he"s equally satisfied with a good daily walk, especially if there"s plenty of sniffing time built in. Afterward, expect him to sack out on the sofa, preferably in or near your lap. This is a dog who likes his comforts. Black and Tan Coonhounds are fond of children and willing playmates. They get along well with other dogs and can even be buddies with cats if properly introduced. They possess good watchdog skills, and are likely to sound off with a deep-throated bark to alert you that someone"s approaching. This dog is big enough to look intimidating, but unlikely to bite or otherwise harm anyone. As with every breed, Coonhounds have some drawbacks. For one thing, they can have a houndy odor. This is something you"ll either love or hate. Be sure you love it, because it can"t be washed away for more than a day or two. Also, these dogs can sing. No, you"re not getting the Mormon Tabernacle Choir here but the deep bay of a hound who"s treed a squirrel, cat, or other furry animal foolish enough to enter your yard. Lots of people love the music of the hounds, but those people might not include your neighbors. Nor is this a breed for the houseproud. Black and Tan Coonhounds drool when it"s hot, slobber after drinking water, and shed heavily. Finally, he"s not for the faint of heart. A Coonhound needs a leader who"s as stubborn and smart as he is. Still, if you can have a sense of humor and can accept his drawbacks, plus provide the Black and Tan with the human companionship he loves, moderate daily exercise, and firm, consistent, patient training, it"s hard not to fall in love with this breed.
Bays and howls as only a hound can; city living is not recommended Easily distracted by various scents. Once he has decided to follow one you"ll have a very hard time calling him off — this dog needs to be leashed! Coonhounds are not homebodies and will roam if given the chance. They can go for miles before looking up and realizing that home is nowhere to be found. Makes a good jogging or running companion but is also more than satisfied with 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, and walks that allow for plenty of sniffing time. This breed does well with children, but is active and bouncy when young. Easily gains weight if given the chance. Can be stubborn and independent, making training a challenge. A bored Coonhound is a noisy, destructive Coonhound. He needs lots human companionship and training. Obedience training is highly recommended and likely to lead to a closer relationship with your dog. Never buy a Black and Tan Coonhound from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents. Interview breeders thoroughly, and make sure the puppy"s parents have been screened for genetic diseases pertinent to that breed. Ask breeders about the health issues they"ve encountered in their dogs, and don"t believe anyone who claims that her dogs never have any health problems. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they"re happy with their Coonhound. Doing your homework may save you a lot of heartbreak later.
Scenthounds descend from the Talbot Hound, the hunting dog used by nobles and kings a thousand years ago. The direct ancestor of the Black and Tan Coonhound is the English Foxhound, but the coonhound breeds themselves are a uniquely American creation. The Black and Tan Coonhound, developed in the mountains of the southern United States in the 1700s, takes his size, coloring, long ears, and scenting ability from the foxhounds and bloodhounds perched in the branches of his family tree. He was bred to tree raccoons and possums, but he"s more than capable of running bigger game. That versatility made him an ideal companion for colonial settlers who created him to be a "trail and tree" dog, meaning he could find his quarry and tree it until the hunter arrived. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1945. The first Black and Tan Coonhound registered by the AKC was Grand Mere Big Rock Molly. Despite his fine qualities, the Coonhound has never made the leap to popular companion dog, something for which his fans are probably grateful. He ranks 131st among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
The largest of the six coonhound breeds, Black and Tans range in weight from 75 to 100 pounds. Males stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder, females 23 to 25 inches.
This working scenthound was bred to work closely with other hounds, so he knows how to go along and get along with canine pals. With people he doesn"t know, he might be reserved but never shy or vicious. He can be headstrong and likes to have his own way, but with firm, consistent, patient training the Black and Tan Coonhound is a well-mannered companion, albeit one who"s slow to mature. Expect to have a fun-loving puppy on your hands for at least three years. At home he"s an easygoing friend, but put him on a scent trail and he"s as serious as a heart attack. This compulsion to follow his nose means you won"t ever want to have him off leash unless you"re in an enclosed area.
As with all breeds, the Black and Tan Coonhound can be prone to certain health conditions. Following are some conditions that can affect Black and Tan Coonhounds: Hip Dysplasia (HD): This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Cataracts. A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Note: Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least two years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed. Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Black and Tan Coonhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than two years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.
Being a pack dog, the Black and Tan Coonhound is among the few breeds who can adjust to kennel life and even live outdoors — if it"s not too cold, he"s with another social dog, and he"s given warm, dry shelter. But if he"s an only dog, he should live indoors with his human pack so he doesn"t get lonely. If you do keep him outside, make it during the day only and bring him in at night. He"ll need a large fenced yard since hounds are the original "travelin" man" and will roam for miles if they catch whiff of an interesting scent. A fence keeps your Black and Tan Coonhound safely at home. Note: An underground electronic fencing isn"t strong enough to contain him. Because of his tendency to wander, it"s essential that a Coonhound be tattooed and microchipped and always wear a collar with identification tags. Coonhounds are big enough to countersurf, and they"ll eat anything you leave within reach. Put the garbage up high, and don"t leave pies, bread, roasts, or any other goodies cooling on the counter, or they"ll be gone when you turn your head. It is important to crate train your Coonhound puppy. Puppies explore, get into things they shouldn"t, and chew stuff that can harm them. It can be expensive both to fix and replace destroyed items, not to mention the vet bills. Crate training ensures not only the safety of your puppy but that of your belongings. While they"re mainly sweet and easygoing, Black and Tan Coonhounds have the independent and stubborn nature common to hounds. They"ve been bred to work on their own, and don"t necessarily see why they should have to do things your way. On the plus side, they generally housetrain quickly. Obedience training is highly recommended, but don"t count on perfect compliance. This is a dog who enjoys putting his own spin on obedience commands. Use treats and positive reinforcement techniques to persuade your Black and Tan that he wants to do as you ask. And "ask" is the operative word. Hounds will flat-out ignore you if you try to boss them around. When training a Black and Tan Coonhound, bear in mind the saying that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Hounds like to eat. Monitor your Black and Tan Coonhound"s food intake so he doesn"t get fat. Keep your Coonhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Coonhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A short, dense coat protects the Black and Tan Coonhound as he trails his quarry through rough brush. It is, of course, black, with rich tan markings above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, and on the chest, legs, and back of the thighs. The toes bear markings that look as if they were made with a black pencil. Brush the Black and Tan two to three times a week with a hound mitt or firm bristle brush to distribute skin oils and keep loose hair from floating off the dog and onto your furniture and clothing. Check and clean his long, graceful ears weekly to prevent infections. Bathe as needed. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Black and Tan Coonhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Nails should be trimmed regularly to keep them short. Your Black and Tan"s nails may need to be trimmed weekly or only monthly; each dog is different. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Coonhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Get your Coonhound accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Black and Tan Coonhounds are patient and tolerant with children. That said, it"s never appropriate to leave dogs and young children alone together. They should always be supervised to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party. Being pack dogs, Black and Tan Coonhounds are always happy to have the company of other dogs. A bored hound will find ways to entertain himself — destructive ways that you won"t like — so if no one"s home during the day, it"s best if he has at least one canine buddy. They can also get along well with cats, rabbits and similar pets if they"re raised with them in the home. Be sensible and don"t leave them unsupervised with other pets until you"re sure they all get along.
Black and Tan Coonhounds are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Coonhounds end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Contact rescue organizations for more information about available dogs and adoption requirements.

The Black Mouth Cur, named for the characteristic black color that usually covers its lips and muzzle, is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, nor is any dog with "cur" in its name. Despite this fact, it is a purebred dog that hails from the southeastern United States where it was bred to be an all-around working dog capable of protecting its human family, and the United Kennel Club recognizes the Black Mouth Cur as a purebred scenthound. These dogs are known for their courage, loyalty, and strength, though they are also quite sensitive and are highly intuitive when it comes to knowing how their humans are feeling.The Black Mouth Cur requires an experienced owner with a Goldilocks approach to training. Owners must be firm, but not overly punitive or harsh to find a balance that is just right. These dogs have high exercise needs and do best with a large yard where they can run in addition to being provided with at least one long walk per day, lest they become bored and destructive in the home. They interact well with people and other dogs, though they are highly territorial and may respond aggressively to perceived intruders or threats to their family. It is important to start socialization training early to make sure Black Mouth Curs behave and remain non-aggressive.
This is a working dog that is comfortable as a hunting companion, a livestock herder, and a home protector. Black Mouth Curs have minimal grooming needs and shed moderately. One brushing per week should get the job done. The breed is incredibly loyal to its human family, especially children, though its tendency to play rough may make it ill suited for very young children. There are several different breeders of Black Mouth Curs who may produce differences in size, coat, and personality traits. Black Mouth Curs require a trainer that is able to maintain a firm hand, but these dogs are highly sensitive and do not respond to harsh rebukes. Training sessions should be thorough and productive, yet short enough to keep the dog"s attention. This breed is not the best choice for inexperienced owners. The Black Mouth Cur is energetic and requires a yard to run and burn off energy, as well as a bare minimum of one long walk per day. Anything less may result in boredom and destructive behavior. Black Mouth Curs are not apartment dogs. Black Mouth Curs are considered to be generally healthy dogs and are less prone to several of the conditions that plague other purebreds, though they do have some genetic predispositions that owners should be aware of and watch out for. In the novel Old Yeller, the titular dog is a Black Mouth Cur, though the dog who played Old Yeller in the 1957 film adaptation was a Labrador Retriever and Mastiff mix named Spike.
The origin of the Black Mouth Cur breed is somewhat of a mystery, but what is known is that the breed originated in the American south, most likely in Mississippi or Tennessee. This breed is probably descended from European and Asian cur dogs that were brought to North America and used by pioneers and settlers who hunted and farmed the land from Florida to Texas. They needed a farm dog that could help them herd livestock and hunt in the rugged terrain of the region, as well as ward off dangerous wildlife. The Black Mouth Cur played a major role in the settling of the American frontier, and some claim that westward expansion by European settlers wouldn"t have been possible without the breed.During those times, curs were crossbred with other dogs as needed, and record keeping on which breeds were used wasn"t of great importance. The lack of records contributes to the unknown specifics when it comes to the origin of the Black Mouth Cur. Some speculate that English Mastiffs, which were brought to America from Europe as early as the Mayflower voyage to Plymouth in 1621, played a part in the Back Mouth Cur"s ancestry. Whatever the case may be, it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when purebred Black Mouth Curs first appeared, and even today, there is variation in the breed based on the region and specific breeder that produces them. Still, they are considered to be purebred dogs, as modern Black Mouth Curs are usually only intentionally bred with other Black Mouth Curs.The Ladner family in southern Mississippi has bred Black Mouth Curs for over 100 years and may be the most well-known breeder of these dogs. Other variations include the Alabama Black Mouth Cur, known for their red coloration, and the Florida Black Mouth Cur, recognizable by its yellow coat. All of these variations have made it difficult to establish breed standards, which is why several kennel clubs do not recognize the breed, including the American Kennel Club. The United Kennel Club, however, registered the Black Mouth Cur in 1998, and they now appear in the show ring.The most famous Black Mouth Cur is the titular dog in the novel Old Yeller. Although the Black Mouth Cur breed isn"t mentioned by name, the physical description of the dog, as well as the depiction of his temperament and behavioral characteristics, heavily imply that Old Yeller is a Black Mouth Cur.
There can be much variation in size when it comes to Black Mouth Curs depending on breeding, and dogs within the same litter can be of different sizes, as well. Males tend to be larger, weighing in on average between 40 and 95 pounds, while females tend to range from 35 to 80 pounds. The breed is usually 16 inches in height or taller. Sometimes the purpose for which the dog has been bred factors into their size. Tree dogs range from 35 to 50 pounds, while herding dogs can weigh over 100 pounds.
The history of the Black Mouth Cur has had a heavy influence on which traits have been kept in the breed. Settlers needed a dog that could suit all of their needs, rather than focusing on a specific task. Black Mouth Curs are known to be courageous and never back down from a fight, which was useful in warding off predators of the American south, including wildcats, bears, and other animals. They have retained this fearlessness to modern times.Settlers also needed a dog that would be intelligent that could help them hunt for food and valuable pelts. They needed a dog that would be a loyal and dedicated family companion so that it would protect the homestead. They needed a dog that would be strong and able to handle life in the rugged frontier. All of these traits remain with the modern Black Mouth Cur.They were also bred to have a high energy level appropriate for long days of hard work, so it is important for Black Mouth Curs to get a good deal of exercise. They don"t do well in apartments or sitting on a couch all day. A yard to run around and at least one long walk per day are essential, as anything less can lead to boredom, anxiety, and destructive behavior.When it comes to training, the Black Mouth Cur can be stubborn, but an overly harsh approach does not work for this sensitive breed. They need a trainer who will be firm and lay down the law, but also won"t raise their voice in anger or frustration. Black Mouth Curs are eager to please, but they will also get bored if training sessions are too long or repetitive, and their attention may drift. Short, focused training sessions are best.
The Black Mouth Cur is considered to be a generally healthy breed with fewer of the genetic problems that tend to affect other breeds and a lifespan that usually goes well into its teens. Still, there are a few conditions that they are predisposed to. Owners should watch out for these conditions throughout their dogs" lives. Some of the conditions that might affect Black Mouth Curs include ear infections, epilepsy, mange, hip dysplasia, and cataracts.
It is important to care for a Black Mouth Cur"s ears, as they can trap dirt, water, and debris, leading to ear infections and other complications. This is especially true of dogs that like to play outdoors in water or in humid areas. Frequent, thorough ear cleanings are a must to prevent infection. They should also regularly have their eyes and bone health checked during routine vet visits to spot signs of cataracts, hip dysplasia, or other eye and skeletal conditions. Their teeth should be brushed regularly and professionally cleaned as needed. Your veterinarian can advise you further on what kind of care you should provide for your Black Mouth Cur.
A healthy diet for a Black Mouth Cur can vary depending on the dog"s size and the activities they participate in throughout the day. Working dogs that hunt or round up livestock, for example, need food that will provide them with adequate energy while they are performing their daily tasks. Dogs that stay at home and get moderate exercise have different needs. Typically, Black Mouth Curs need two quality meals per day.Your veterinarian should be able to help you determine an appropriate diet for your Black Mouth Cur based on their size and energy requirements. Make sure they get balanced meals, and you may wish to consult a nutritionist to advise you on what to feed your dog.
The appearance of Black Mouth Curs can vary depending on breeding, and even individuals of the same litter can look very different. Their coats are short and can either be course or fine. They can be red, yellow, black, brown, or brindle. Most have some black fur on their muzzle, the trademark that gives the breed its name, but not all of them do. Some may have the appearance of a mask around their face and eyes. Patches of white may appear on the face, chest, legs, or tail. Their eyes may be green, yellow, or brown.Black Mouth Cur coats shed moderately throughout the year and a bit more heavily before winter and summer. Generally, they need very little care. One brushing per week should be fine, and many Black Mouth Curs can go their whole lives without having their coats professionally groomed. They will need regular nail trimmings, and it"s important to keep their face and ears clean, especially where there are folds in the skin as these places can harbor bacteria, parasites, or debris.
The breed can be friendly to other dogs, especially if socialization training begins early. This is necessary because Black Mouth Curs can be territorial and respond to strangers or other dogs with aggression if they feel that they or their families are threatened. They are usually fine with another resident dog, though their high prey drive makes them unsuitable for homes with smaller pets, such as cats, rabbits, hamsters, etc.Black Mouth Curs need human interaction and companionship, and they are great with families and kids. As with all dogs, children should be supervised when playing with Black Mouth Curs, as they like to roughhouse and may not know that they need to be gentler with youngsters. It is important to teach children how to interact with dogs appropriately, as well, to avoid injuring them during play.

If the Black Russian Terrier were a human version of the observant guard dog he was bred to be, you"d want him standing guard for you during the most disquieting times. An innate protective instinct is developed by the time he is a year old. When combined with the size, agility, courage, and power of this gorgeous bearded beauty, that instinct creates an outstanding guard dog who loves to play with his family"s kids and hang out by your side. Blackies demand and thrive on human attention and affection, and they"ll wait at the back door until you let them in because playing is just no fun without people. The Black Russian is a working dog who responds best to firm and consistent training. You have to respect him or he won"t tolerate your command. Without a job to do and lacking adequate early training, a Blackie could easily become bored and destructive, and at that size he could do some real damage. He is so smart it"s scary. If you feel that you can"t live with a dog who is smarter than you are, then the Blackie might not be a good choice. Remember that the breed has historically been used to work for the military and police (although these days the Blackie is most often found protecting home and hearth). That intelligence means he trains quickly but can have a real stubborn streak, so you need to be the one in charge from the get-go. If you"re into performance competitions, such as agility, obedience, or Schutzhund, this guy is a natural performer who knows how to work a crowd. He"ll also excel at search and rescue. The Blackie is slow to mature, like most big dogs. He housetrains easily, and he doesn"t need to be leash-trained as he"ll follow naturally while on a leash. He"s also much more active outside than in the house. He can"t be left outside to live in a kennel; he"s just too people-oriented. Besides, some day he could start defending his kennel against you rather than defending your home. He has to see your home as his in order to protect it. Calm and quiet, the Blackie tends to be aloof with strangers, but not aggressive or shy toward them. He"ll accept a stranger that you admit into the household, but he"ll take his time considering whether such a person should be a friend. However, if he feels the stranger is threatening, then all bets are off — he won"t waste a moment hesitating to defend those he loves. Because the Blackie is so intelligent, stubborn, and large, he isn"t a good choice for first-time dog owners. For example, if you don"t want your adult Blackie on the furniture or in your bed, you need to start out right by not allowing the puppy to be in those places. He won"t give up those habits once he"s gotten away with them a time or two — his stubborn streak is just too strong. In some, that streak can be so deep that it doesn"t allow them to compromise at all. That means the Black Russian Terrier is best suited to experienced dog people used to large, dominant guard dogs. They"ll walk all over people they can intimidate — they are large and in charge. Bred to work as a partner with his owner, he is a thinking dog who responds better to logic than to force. Positive reinforcement is best with these guys. But for those who know how to train and live with a powerful, smart guard dog, the Blackie is a wonderful choice.
Blackies need a job. They were bred for it and will be unhappy without one. Their job as your companion could be competing in agility, obedience, Schutzhund, or various canine sports. Black Russian Terriers need at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. They are intelligent and powerful, and exercise provides a needed outlet. A Black Russian can manage in an apartment with sufficient outdoor exercise. A fenced yard is best for the Blackie living in a house. They don"t bark or shed much — but they do bark and shed. Blackies enjoy the company of their families and prefer to stick close to their human pack. They don"t do well stuck in the backyard by themselves. The sometimes stubborn Blackie needs firm training as soon as you get him home so that he won"t try to establish himself as the leader of the pack. Blackies are by nature aloof with people they don"t know, and unless they have regular exposure to lots of different people — ideally beginning in puppyhood — they can become overly protective of you around strangers. This may lead to biting out of fear and aggression. Give your Blackie lots of contact with friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers to help him polish his social skills. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
A legacy of the Cold War, the Black Russian Terrier was bred by Soviet Army scientists who were striving for the perfect working dog. Wonderfully adapted to the inhospitable Russian winters, the Black Russian was bred to patrol the borders alongside soldiers. The scientists weren"t trying to invent a new breed; they just wanted a dog who was suited to their military needs. The Red Star Kennel, where the breeding took place, was established under the Red Army and had the full resources of the government for assistance. Unfortunately, thanks to the Russian Revolution, World War II, and other economic difficulties, purebred dog breeding had taken a back seat during much of the 20th century, and the team — which included breeders and geneticists — didn"t have much homebred stock with which to work. However, they did an admirable job. They wanted a dog with endurance who could run long fence lines, chase and catch intruders, and stay warm enough to survive. They started crossing Giant Schnauzers, Airedales, and Rottweilers, but there are traces of 17 breeds, including Great Danes and some large Russian breeds such as the Ovcharka. The Blackies worked at rail crossings, prisons, and assorted military venues including gulags, and they excelled at it. However, when the gulags began closing in the 1950s, they had more dogs than needed, and thus the Army began selling the puppies to the public. Fanciers made a few changes in the breeding; Newfoundlands, for instance, were added for stability. In 1958, the Soviet Army created the first breed standard for the Black Russian Terrier. Officially, the Black Russian Terrier obtained breed status from the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture in 1981. It didn"t take long for him to become one of the most admired breeds of the world because of his many fine traits: large size, ability to protect home and family, excellent working abilities, courage, elegant appearance, sociability, and love of children. Black Russian Terriers came to the United States between 1989 and 1990. One of the first American kennels to produce Black Russians was in Mississippi, where an immigrant Russian couple started a kennel. (Blackies do well there even without any hope of snow in which to play.) The AKC admitted the Black Russian Terrier into the Miscellaneous Class in 2001. The breed became part of the AKC Working Group on July 1, 2004. Over time, breeders have worked to eliminate the health concerns and physical faults that the breed began with, and today the Blackie is a healthy and hearty breed, still just becoming known to legions of dog lovers.
A powerful, well-built large breed, the Black Russian"s weight can range from 80 to 140 pounds (although 140 is a bit above average). Males can be 27 to 30 inches tall; females can be 26 to 29 inches tall.
Black Russian Terriers are calm, confident, and courageous. These dogs have exceptionally stable nervous systems and radiate confidence and tranquility. Bred by the military, they"re self-assured, loyal, and aloof toward those they don"t know. Purposely designed to guard and protect, Blackies could become dangerous without their famous emotional stability. Highly intelligent, Blackies take well to firm direction and need a job to perform, so training is easy. Start early to offset a potential sense of overprotection. Blackies love children and will guard those in their circle. They"re house dogs and need to feel like part of the family — they aren"t not suited to life in the backyard. Blackies need almost constant attention and guidance, and they"ll become withdrawn if you don"t give them enough. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Black Russian Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Blackie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. The more properly socialized Blackies are, the better they are with other dogs, although some will only enjoy other canine companions who live in their household. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Blackies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Blackies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Blackies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.
Your Blackie needs daily exercise and mental stimulation, at least half an hour each day, including walks, runs, disc games, obedience, or agility. Hanging out alone in the back yard is not exercise; even if that"s what you intended, your Blackie will just spend the time at the door waiting to be let back in. He has a great need for human contact, so he"s always happier when you"re hanging out with him. When you"re not playing with your companion, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied. The Blackie can live in an apartment as long as he has adequate exercise. In a single-family dwelling, he should have a fenced yard. Puppies don"t need as much hard exercise as adults, and, in fact, you shouldn"t let them run on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they"re at least a year to eighteen months old. Otherwise large-breed pups like the Blackie may stress their still-developing skeletal systems, which can cause future joint problems. Obedience classes can help you curb your Blackie"s behavior, as they help satisfy his need for mental stimulation and work. He"ll respond well to training methods that use positive reinforcement — rewards such as praise, play, and food — and is likely to happily take commands from his trainer. He just needs to know who"s in charge. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Blackie doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Blackie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Your Blackie doesn"t want to spend all day in a crate, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Blackies are people-oriented dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives alone or in a crate.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Blackie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Blackie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Blackies have black coats, but a sprinkling of gray hair can sometimes be seen, even in puppies. They have a double coat, and the outer coat is coarse, with the undercoat soft and thick. It varies in length from 1.5 to 4 inches. Blackies have a tousled coat, although some might be tempted to call it wiry or curly. Brushing is a weekly event for Blackies: they need regular and frequent maintenance to prevent matting. To brush that coat, you"ll want a slicker brush, an undercoat rake, and a stripping comb. You can find any of these grooming tools in a good pet supply store. Blackies don"t shed a lot, but those dogs with longer coats may leave little clumps of hair everywhere unless brushed regularly. The eyebrows, moustache, and beard can be left alone and aren"t trimmed. Show grooming for Blackies is a fairly involved task, but if your companion isn"t showing in conformation, the coat can be clipped twice a year for manageability. You can clip your companion yourself; it takes a little practice but it"s not difficult. If you keep him brushed, your Blackie should need a bath only when he"s dirty. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his skin and coat. The Blackie beard soaks up water which he can then spray liberally around the house, so the beard may need a little extra attention during grooming. Brush your Blackie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Blackie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Despite their impressive size, Blackies are great with children and will protect them. Females seem more willing to play with children than the males, but both sexes treat children with whom they are raised with gentleness and respect. Don"t forget, however, that Blackies are large and active companions, and extremely young children may be accidentally knocked over or injured by a playful and energetic dog of this size. Use caution with very young children. Blackies who have not been exposed to children from puppyhood may not be as tolerant--something to consider if you"re looking to add an older or rescue dog to your household. Either way, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Make sure your Blackie is well socialized as a puppy and adult so that he doesn"t become overprotective of his family and property. Male Black Russians don"t do well with other dominant dogs. Many of them aren"t suited to dog parks for this reason. At home, they do best with other canine companions who were already established in the house. They will be fine with nondominant or small dogs, as well as cats, horses, rabbits, and other pets.
Blackies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Blackies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

When we think of the Bloodhound, the images that come to mind range from the baying mantrailers in such films as Cool Hand Luke to a lazy hound sunning himself on the front porch of a home in a sleepy Southern town.The mantrailer is the more accurate image, but it also presents a somewhat false picture of the breed. The Bloodhound is indeed single-minded on the trail, but what many people don"t realize is that once he"s found his quarry, he might lick the person to death, but he"ll never attack.This wrinkled hound is gentle and affectionate, but he"s far from lazy. He can follow a scent trail for miles and will always prefer that to sleeping on the sun porch. Expect to commit to long walks every day if you live with a Bloodhound.The Bloodhound belongs to a group of dogs that hunt together by scent, known as Sagaces, from the Latin, which is the same root as the word "sagacious," referring to the qualities of keen discernment and sound judgment. Those words are certainly descriptive of the Bloodhound"s powers of scent.Originally used in medieval Europe to trail boar and deer, modern-day Bloodhounds have found careers as mantrailers for police departments and search and rescue organizations. So skillful are they that their "testimony" is considered admissible in a court of law. He can be a family dog, too, but he requires a high level of care.It"s not everyone who can live with a large dog who slings slobber, exudes a distinctive houndy odor, wants nothing more than to follow his nose, wreaks destruction in puppyhood, has endless energy and endurance, and is the definition of the word stubborn. If you can, you"ll find the Bloodhound to be kind, sensitive, and tolerant of children and other animals. With the right family, he"s a dog of great character who brings much joy and laughter.
This is a very active breed, not the lazy dog you may have seen portrayed on The Beverly Hillbillies. Bloodhounds are working dogs and need long daily walks or runs. Bloodhounds are not suited for apartment living. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard. Bloodhounds are pack dogs and will enjoy the company of other dogs. A cat will do in a pinch. Bloodhounds slobber and shed. Keep baby wipes or hand towels on hand throughout the house, and brush them weekly or more often if needed. Bloodhounds love and are extremely tolerant with them. Teach children how to treat a Bloodhound properly and supervise play between them. Bloodhounds may be too large for toddlers; they can knock them down with a single swipe of the tail. Bloodhounds need a fenced yard. This is not an option but a necessity. If they come across an interesting scent, they will follow it, head down, nose to the ground, eyes covered by their wonderful ears, oblivious to traffic and other dangers. For the same reason you need a fenced yard, you need to walk a Bloodhound on leash. Known for their stubbornness, Bloodhounds need an owner who is firm, loving, and consistent. A Bloodhound who is mistreated or feels he is mistreated will pout and hide. Bloodhounds do well with positive reinforcement training. Bloodhounds are prone to recurring ear infections. Routinely check their ears and clean them on a regular basis. Bloodhounds will chew and swallow the most unimaginable items, from rocks and plants to batteries and TV remotes. When they"re not following a trail, Bloodhounds prefer to live indoors with the family. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Dogs that hunt by scent have been known for millennia. Reports of dogs that "discover and trace out the tracks of the animal" date as far back as the first century AD. It was in medieval Europe, however, that the dogs began to be developed into the scenthound we know today as the Bloodhound.The first actual reference to the breed by that name was in a poem by Sir Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford, titled William of Palerne (1350). It depicts a dog, called a Bloodhound, as a careful hunter who is on the trail of two lovers disguised as bears.From that poem, we can deduce that the name Bloodhound was a familiar word in the English language. The name comes from the dogs" status as an aristocratic breed kept by noblemen and abbots; in other words, it was a "blooded" hound.These early scenthounds were known as St. Hubert hounds, bred by the monks of St. Hubert"s Abbey, and they were the ancestors of today"s Bloodhounds. During his life, Francois Hubert (656-727) was a passionate hunter who made it his life"s work to breed dogs capable of following old, or cold, trails, an occupation he maintained even after retiring to a monastery following the death of his wife.After his death, he was canonized and became the patron saint of hunters. In France, you will still hear Bloodhounds referred to as St. Hubert hounds.For several centuries after Hubert"s death, his hounds flourished. William the Conqueror took them to England when he invaded in 1066. They were highly prized gifts among monarchs and nobles. Elizabeth I, a noted huntress, kept packs of St. Hubert hounds, and Shakespeare described a dog that could only have been one in his play "A Midsummer Night"s Dream."But a thousand years after their beginning, the St. Hubert hounds were brought low by the French Revolution. With the aristocracy fled and the chateaus in ruins, the great hunts were no more.Fortunately for the breed, they were still prized in England, not only for the skills in the hunt, but also for their ability to track down wrongdoers. The first written record of Bloodhounds tracking thieves and poachers was in 1805, although stories of their use for that purpose date to the 16th century.They also benefited from three Victorian-era trends: the rise of dog shows, the new status of dogs as companions, and a society that loved anything exotic or unusual. They had as well the patronage of dog-loving Queen Victoria, who entered one of her Bloodhounds in a dog show in 1869.England is where the modern Bloodhound was developed, but the breed had also made its way to America in colonial times. In a letter, Benjamin Franklin expressed an interest in acquiring some Bloodhounds to track down marauding Indians.Through no fault of his own, the Bloodhound"s reputation took a whipping during the Civil War, thanks to the breed"s depiction as vicious beasts in Harriet Beecher Stowe"s antislavery novel Uncle Tom"s Cabin. Interest in them waned until 1888 when three English Bloodhounds competed in the Westminster Kennel Club show. Wealthy Americans took an interest in them and began breeding them again, producing some very fine dogs.Today, the Bloodhound is employed primarily by law enforcement agencies as a mantrailer or for search and rescue work. They are an uncommon breed, ranking 45th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
The male Bloodhound stands 25 to 27 inches tall and weighs 90 to 110 pounds; females are 23 to 25 inches and 80 to 100 pounds.
The dignified Bloodhound is a study in contradictions. He"s docile yet stubborn, determined but not quarrelsome, affectionate but somewhat shy with people he doesn"t know. When it comes to training, he"s sensitive to kindness or correction, but he still wants to do things his way.He can sniff out the slightest hint of a trail, but as a watchdog or guard dog, he"s poor, given his love of people. Some Bloodhounds can be vocal, barking up a storm when they"re excited. Others are nice and quiet.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Bloodhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bloodhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Bloodhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bloodhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Bloodhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or weight management or anti-inflammatory medication to control the pain. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Ectropion: Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infection. If ectropion is severe, it can be corrected surgically. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Bloodhound has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if needed when the dog matures. Epilepsy: This seizure disorder, which can be hereditary, acquired, or of unknown cause, can be managed with medication, but it can"t be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disease. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Fold Dermatitis: This skin infection is caused by friction or trapped moisture in the folds of the skin. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor, usually on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, and any fold on the body. The treatment for Fold Dermatitis can vary depending on the area that is affected but it can include surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. It can also include topical ointments, antibiotics. The best means of treatment is to properly maintain your dog"s coat and subsequent folds to prevent the condition.
Bloodhounds should be indoor/outdoor dogs who have frequent interaction with their people. They are best suited to homes with large fenced yards. Many are escape artists and require fences at least six feet high. Underground electronic fences will not contain a Bloodhound. His desire to follow a scent is far stronger than the fear of a momentary shock.It was once said that Bloodhound people always have one arm that"s longer than the other. That"s because this breed is a strong puller, thanks to his nose dragging him forward as he follows a trail. Your Bloodhound can learn to walk nicely on a leash, and he must be leashed when outside the yard to prevent him from taking off to find the source of an interesting smell.Bloodhounds need long daily walks and are capable of going for miles. If you live in the country or enjoy hiking, this is the breed for you. They can make great jogging buddies. You may also wish to train your Bloodhound for search and rescue work or tracking tests.Like all breeds, a Bloodhound puppy"s exercise should be limited until he reaches physical maturity. The rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every month of age; therefore, a 3-month-old puppy should be exercised for only 15 minutes a day, a 4-month-old for 20 minutes, and so on. Know your dog"s signs of fatigue.Bloodhound puppies are nosy, curious, and into everything. Crate training is highly recommended. Not only will it keep them out of trouble and save your belongings from destruction, it"s an excellent aid to housetraining. This breed is easily housetrained, but a crate will help him learn to control his bladder and bowels.Your adult Bloodhound is just the right height to go counter-surfing, so keep food well out of reach. A swipe of his long, tapering tail can clear a coffee table. You might want to put breakables elsewhere.Bloodhounds of all ages are chewers and will chew on anything that smells good or looks interesting. Be diligent in letting your Bloodhound know what"s okay to chew and what isn"t. He still might eat your lawn furniture, but if you"ve provided him with plenty of chew toys and exercise, he"s somewhat less likely to do so.When it comes to training, Bloodhounds are highly intelligent but independent, with a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. Be consistent in what you permit or don"t permit, or your Bloodhound will constantly test whether you really mean what you say. Be patient and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise and food rewards.Keep training sessions short, about 15 minutes, and always end them when your Bloodhound has done something well and you can praise him for it. Give firm but gentle corrections, never harsh verbal or physical punishment. Most important, remember this bit of advice: Never tell a Bloodhound what to do, ask him.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Bloodhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.Bloodhounds are messy eaters, so you may want to tuck the ears into a snood before mealtime. Choose water dishes with a narrow diameter to help keep the ears from dragging in them.Bloodhounds are prone to gastric torsion, also known as bloat. Factors that contribute to bloat include eating a large meal and then drinking large amounts of water, heavy exercise directly before or after a meal, giving food in raised feeding dishes, and stress. Keep these things in mind when you feed your Bloodhound.For more on feeding your Bloodhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bloodhound"s coat is loose and thin to the touch. Around the neck and head, it hangs in deep folds. As the head hangs down, the skin falls into loose, pendulous ridges and folds, especially over the forehead and sides of the face. These wrinkles, combined with the loose, pendulous skin beneath the neck and throat (known as the dewlap) and the long, sweeping ears, help funnel scent from the ground up to the Bloodhound"s nose and hold it there.Bloodhound colors are black and tan, liver and tan, and red. The darker colors are sometimes interspersed with lighter or badger-colored hair (a mixture of white, gray, brown, and black) or flecked with white. You may see a small amount of white on the chest, feet, and tail tip, known as the stern.Brush your Bloodhound weekly, or more often if you prefer, with a rubber hound mitt. He sheds seasonally, and during that time you may want to use a shedding blade to remove excess hair. Remember that his skin is thin and be gentle.Clean his wrinkles daily to prevent bacterial infections. Wipe them out with a damp washcloth and then dry them thoroughly. Do the same for the flews (the hanging part of the upper lip) after every meal.A Bloodhound"s ears seem to be specially designed for trapping dirt and breeding yeast and bacteria, making them prone to infection. Clean them weekly with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. Hold the ear up so you can see the ear canal. Squeeze in a large amount of ear cleaner, lower the ear flap, and gently massage the liquid into the ear. You will hear a swooshing sound, and your Bloodhound will probably moan with pleasure.Now take a cotton ball and wipe the debris outward from the outer ear canal. (Don"t insert it any further than the first knuckle of your finger.) Let the dog shake his head and repeat the wipedown with a clean cotton ball. Every time your Bloodhound shakes his head, it pulls out more debris from deep within the ear canal. Repeat the wiping until the cotton ball is no longer dirty. Never dig around in the ears with a cotton swab; you could easily damage them.If your Bloodhound"s ears develop an infection despite your best efforts, have your veterinarian test the dog to determine the cause of the infection. Then he or she can prescribe the most effective antibiotic to clear it up.The Bloodhound"s need for ear care can be a big deterrent for some prospective owners and is something you should take into consideration. If you don"t have time to properly care for a Bloodhound, including the time it takes to ensure clean ears, then this breed may not be for you.The only other grooming a Bloodhound needs is dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bloodhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Bloodhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Bloodhounds love children. That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. They"re best suited to homes with older children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.In general, Bloodhounds are quite friendly with other dogs, although a few have issues with small dogs. They usually get along fine with cats, although your cat may not appreciate being slobbered on.
Bloodhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Bloodhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Bloodhound rescue.

These dogs have a noble history, being descendants of the French Grand Bleu de Gascogne and the English Foxhound, many of whom were brought to the United States in colonial times. On the trail, the Bluetick may be slower than some of his coonhound compatriots, but he has a superior nose and a never-say-die attitude. Although he"s a hunter first and foremost, the Bluetick can be a fine housedog and loves his people. Bear in mind that hounds are a challenge to train. Be patient and persistent as you help them find their motivation, which is more likely to be food than any real desire to please.

Boerboels" physical strength is only matched by the strength of their devotion to their homes and families. The Boerboel breed is descended from dogs brought by Dutch settlers to South Africa who defended the homestead from hyenas, lions, leopards, and other dangerous wildlife. Today, they are prized as watchdogs, guardians, and competitors in canine competitions, as well as highly protective family companions that adore kids. They can, however, be quite territorial, and without proper training and socialization, they can exhibit aggressive tendencies to strangers and other dogs. Boerboels require plenty of mental and physical exercise. Being surprisingly agile for their size and very intelligent, their need for stimulation of both mind and body is high. Leaving them alone for too long can result in boredom and anxiety, which can lead to destructive behavior. They need a home that can accommodate their size and exercise needs and a trainer who is patient and confident. In the right home, they can be an invaluable watchdog and affectionate pet for the whole family.
The Boerboel is a massive dog and incredibly muscular. They weigh as much as Great Danes, even though they are significantly shorter in stature. There is much speculation about which breeds were bred together to make the modern Boerboel, but their exact ancestry is not well known. Dutch settlers brought dogs to South Africa to defend farms from big cats and other wildlife. Only the strongest dogs were able to survive the harsh climate and conditions in South Africa, and they became some of the ancestors of the modern Boerboel. After the World Wars, breeding wasn"t regulated, and the Boerboel almost completely disappeared. It has made a resurgence after breed enthusiasts began an effort to restore the Boerboel in the 1980s. Boerboels are known to be especially loving and protective of their human children. They are excellent guardians, though they can be overprotective. The Boerboel has minimal grooming needs and few health concerns, though their need for training and socialization makes them a poor choice for novice owners. Since Boerboels have been revived in South Africa, they have grown in popularity and have been exported around the world. Even so, they are still considered to be a more rare breed. Although they average between 110 and 200 pounds, it is not unheard of for Boerboels to weigh well over 200 pounds. The Boerboel is considered to be the most agile of the Mastiff type dogs. Socialization is necessary for Boerboels, as they can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex and breed.
The name "Boerboel" comes Afrikaans/Dutch words for farmer ("boer") and dog ("boel"), and indeed they were farmers" dogs when they were bred by Dutch settlers in South Africa starting in the 1600s. They were needed to defend the homestead and hunt dangerous wildlife such as hyenas, baboons, leopards, and other big cats. Eurpoean settlers brought large, strong dogs with them to South Africa, which bred with indigenous domestic dogs and a variety of other breeds over the course of several centuries. Bulldogs and Mastiffs were also brought by the English and crossbred with Boerboels, and the Da Beers diamond mining company imported Bull Mastiffs to guard their mines, which also bred with Boerboels to make them what they are today. It is uncertain exactly which breeds make up the Boerboel"s ancestry, but only the strongest dogs were able to survive the hot weather and encounters with wildlife, which contributed to the Boerboel"s tenacity and strength. During the 1800s, colonists began to protest British rule of South Africa and moved inland. As a consequence, their dogs were scattered and often taken in by isolated communities, where they became necessary for hunting, herding, guarding, and protection from dangerous people. After the World Wars, South Africa became more urbanized, and Boerboels started to be crossbred with other dogs without regard for breed purity. In the 1980s, however, a group of breed enthusiasts sought to begin breeding pure Boerboels again. Due to their efforts, the Boerboel gained popularity in South Africa and started to be exported around the world. The breed, however, is still fairly rare outside of South Africa.
Boerboels are large dogs with males averaging 24 to 28 inches in height at the shoulder, while females tend to be between 22 and 25 inches in height. Boerboels usually weigh between 110 and 200 pounds, though some can be larger or smaller.
Boerboels are playful, intelligent, and eager to please. They are happiest when given a job to do, whether it"s tough farm work, guard dog duty, or preparing for a competition where they can show off their agility and strength. This breed loves human family members, even children, though they are quite overprotective at times. The same instincts that make them good watchdogs and protectors can also make them fiercely territorial and aggressive if they aren"t trained or socialized properly. When having guests over, it is important for a family member to introduce them to the resident Boerboel so the dog doesn"t feel threatened. Usually Boerboels are welcoming of guests that they"ve met and trust, though they may still be on their guard. When it comes to training, Boerboels tend to be dominant and require an assertive trainer who will use positive reinforcement and set boundaries without being harsh. This is not a dog for first time owners. Patient, consistent training should be accompanied by early socialization to prevent aggression, and Boerboels should get plenty of mental and physical stimulation, as they can get bored and anxious, which will lead to destructive behavior. Long walks, vigorous play sessions, and challenging devices like puzzle feeders can all help them get the activity they need. Being a large dog breed with moderate exercise demands, Boerboels require space, so an apartment is not their ideal environment. They do best in a home with a backyard and a high, durable fence that will give them plenty of space to safely run around. While these dogs are not for novices, they will reward the right owners by being adoring family companions that will defend their homes and humans at all costs.
The Boerboel is generally considered to be a healthy breed with few known hereditary conditions. There are, however, a few ailments that they are predisposed to and may develop over the course of their lives. They may suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, heart disease, conditions that affect the eyelids, vaginal hyperplasia, and bloat. Rarely, they may also suffer from juvenile epilepsy. If you see signs of any of these conditions in your Boerboel, you should consult your veterinarian immediately.
The Boerboel"s main need when it comes to care is to be mentally and physically stimulated through exercise and play. Beyond that, regular care is fairly simple. Their nails should be trimmed about once every two weeks, and their teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Boerboels" ears should be checked for debris and wax buildup weekly and cleaned as needed to avoid infection or infestation by pests.
A Boerboel diet should be formulated for a large to giant breed with moderate to high exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Boerboel and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will changes as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.
Boerboels have short, straight overcoats that are smooth and shiny, which cover their soft, dense undercoats. They can be shades of red, fawn, brown, brindle, or black. Some have spots of white on their coat, especially around the neck, face, and paws, though it is considered a fault if more than 30 percent of the coat is white. Many Boerboels have dark markings around their eyes, mouths, and noses, and some have dark patches around their paws. The coat sheds an average amount and doesn"t require much care. Weekly brushing and monthly baths should help catch the shedding fur and keep the coat healthy.
Boerboels love their human families and are especially known for being protectors of their children. That said, they are large, playful dogs and may knock over a child by accident if things get out of hand. Children should be trained on how to interact with animals to avoid incident, as well. No poking and prodding, no matter how trained and docile a Boerboel may be. As with any dog, play time should be supervised. The Boerboel"s natural protective instinct may also be an issue when children have playmates over, as the Boerboel may interpret play as aggression and defend its family. That said, this is a breed that is known for absolutely adoring the human children within the family, and you couldn"t ask for a better kid protector than a gigantic, agile Boerboel. When it comes to other dogs, Boerboels do well with animals that they have been raised with and live in the same household, but they can be quite territorial and standoffish with unfamiliar dogs. They can also become competitive and aggressive with other Boerboels of the same sex. Early socialization can help keep the breed"s confrontational instincts in check, but they may be best suited to a home where they are the only dog.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 6 inches to 1 foot, 10 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  30 to 45 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
If you"ve ever had the pleasure of watching a Border Collie herd sheep, you know you"re watching a master craftsman at work, with his intense stare as he approaches the sheep, his almost intuitive response to the shepherd"s command, and the skillful manner in which he maneuvers the sheep exactly where the shepherd wants them to go. It is awe-inspiring.The Border Collie, a medium-sized dog at 30 to 45 pounds, possesses a seemingly supernatural amount of energy and stamina — a hardiness that was developed when he was required to work all day in the hills and valleys of the rugged Scottish border country, sometimes running 50 miles or more a day. When it comes to the ideal working dog, it doesn"t get much better than the Border Collie.If there is a dark side to the Border Collie"s energy and workaholic attitude, it comes out when he"s brought into a family that doesn"t understand him. He is not a cuddly, couch-potato dog. He doesn"t want to be coddled. He wants — and needs — a job. Keeping up with the Border Collie"s intense mental and physical stamina is exhausting, even exasperating, to an owner or family that wants a laid-back family pet.The Border Collie is a herding dog, which means he has an overwhelming urge to gather a flock. That flock could be sheep, children, cats, squirrels, or anything that moves, including cars. This instinct to nip, nudge, and bark, along with his energy, cannot be trained out of him. Rather, it must be directed. He must have a task, whether it"s actually herding sheep or competing in dog sports. A brisk walk or a game of fetch every day isn"t enough activity for the Border Collie.That said, for the right owner, a Border Collie is a wonderful dog to live with. His intelligence and tractable nature make him easy to train. He"s sensitive and, according to those who know him well, he has an uncanny ability to know what you"re going to ask of him before you ask it. If he is well socialized and trained from puppyhood, he can adapt to almost any living situation that provides the mental and physical exercise he requires.The Border Collie is a good match for an owner who is as active as he is, especially one who"s eager to get involved in dog sports. With the right training, this breed excels in any activity he tries, including sheepdog trials, agility, flyball, flying disc, advanced obedience, freestyle obedience, or tracking.The owner or family that"s willing to properly socialize and train the Border Collie will find a soul mate in this intelligent, sensitive breed.
The Border Collie is highly sensitive, often responsive to the subtlest command and seemingly able to predict his owner"s desires in advance. A workaholic who thrives on mental and physical stimulation, the Border Collie must have a positive way to direct his energy. Otherwise he"ll invent his own games — and he can become a problem to live with. The Border Collie will herd anything that moves, including children, cars, people on bikes, cats, and squirrels. He can become a real problem if he"s allowed to roam in a neighborhood; a securely fenced yard is essential. The noisy play of young children can stimulate the Border Collie"s herding instinct and cause him to nip, nudge, and bark. To prevent shyness, the Border Collie must be well socialized. The Border Collie doesn"t usually roam, but his curiosity and intelligence can lead him to become an escape artist. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Border Collie"s ancestors have been around since humans in what is now Britain first began using dogs to help guard and herd sheep. In the border country between Scotland and England, the herding dog became one of the most valuable assets a shepherd could have, and the best working dogs were bred with each other.The type varied, depending on the terrain or the work required in each region. These herding dogs became associated with their particular regions and were eventually known as Welsh Sheepdogs, Northern Sheepdogs, Highland Collies, and Scotch Collies. The Border Collie"s name reflects his partially Scottish heritage: the word collie, which refers to sheepdogs, is derived from Scottish dialect.In 1860, Scotch Sheep Dogs were shown at the second dog show ever held in England. On a trip to Balmoral a short time later, Queen Victoria saw one of the dogs and became an enthusiast of the breed.One R.J. Lloyd Price is given credit for beginning sheepdog trials. In 1876, he brought 100 wild Welsh sheep to the Alexandra Palace in London for a demonstration. An account in the Livestock Journal described the astonishment of the spectators at the keenness of the dogs, whose only assistance from their handlers was in the form of hand signals and whistles.Today the Border Collie is recognized as the premier sheepherding dog. The breed"s superior herding ability leads many fanciers to advocate breeding Border Collies only to working, not conformation, standards. The Border Collie was recognized by the American Kennel Club on October 1, 1995.
Males stand 19 to 22 inches tall and weigh 35 to 45 pounds. Females stand 18 to 21 inches and weigh 30 to 40 pounds.
Quite simply, the Border Collie is a dynamo. His personality is characteristically alert, energetic, hardworking, and smart. He learns quickly — so quickly that it"s sometimes difficult to keep him challenged.This breed likes to be busy. In fact, he must be busy or he becomes bored, which leads to annoying behavior, such as barking, digging, or chasing cars. He"s not a dog to lie quietly on the front porch while you sip a glass of lemonade; he thrives on activity. Remember, he was bred to run and work all day herding sheep.The Border Collie is also renowned for being highly sensitive to his handler"s every cue, from a whistle to a hand signal to a raised eyebrow.Of course, the Border Collie isn"t perfect. He can be strong-minded and independent, and his compulsion to herd can become misdirected. In the absence of sheep, or some kind of job, he is apt to gather and chase children, cars, or pets.He can also become fearful or shy if he isn"t properly socialized as a puppy. Puppy classes and plenty of exposure to a variety of people, places, and things help the sensitive Border Collie gain confidence.
Border Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Border Collies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Border Collies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Collie Eye Anomaly: This is an inherited condition that causes changes and abnormalities in the eye, which can sometimes lead to blindness. These changes can include choroidal hypoplasia (an abnormal development of the choroids), coloboma (a defect in the optic disc), staphyloma (a thinning of the sclera), and retinal detachment. Collie eye anomaly usually occurs by the time the dog is two years old. There is no treatment for the condition. Allergies: There are three main types of allergies in dogs: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.
While the Border Collie is a highly adaptable dog, he"s best suited to an environment that gives him some elbow room: a city home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch. Because he has a propensity to herd and chase, he must be protected from his not-so-bright instinct to chase cars.Regardless of the environment, he requires a great deal of mental and physical stimulation every day, and he needs an owner who is willing and able to provide that. This can be a great burden to owners who don"t know what they"re getting into. If you"re considering a Border Collie, make sure you can provide him with a proper outlet for his natural energy and bright mind. If you don"t have a farm with sheep, dog sports are a good alternative.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Border Collie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Border Collie breed boasts two varieties of coat: rough and smooth. Both are double coats, with a coarser outer coat and soft undercoat. The rough variety is medium length with feathering on the legs, chest, and belly. The smooth variety is short all over, usually coarser in texture than the rough variety, and feathering is minimal.His coat is most often black with a white blaze on the face, neck, feet, legs, and tail tip, with or without tan. However, he may be any bicolor, tricolor, merle, or solid color except white.The hardworking Border Collie isn"t prissy, and he doesn"t need excessive grooming to keep him looking good. His weather-resistant double coat needs weekly brushing to keep coat oils well distributed, and to prevent matting in the rough variety. More frequent brushing during shedding season is a good idea to minimize hair shed around the house (he sheds seasonally). Bathe only as needed — about every four months or when he"s really dirty or smells terrible.Brush your Border Collie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once a month if needed, and check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Border Collie is a good family dog, as long as he is raised properly and receives training when he"s young. He gets along with children and other pets, though his instinct to herd will cause him to nip, chase, and bark at kids (especially very young children) and animals if his herding instincts aren"t otherwise directed.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Border Collies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Border Collies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Border Collie rescue. Border Collie Society of America

The Border Terrier is a small dog with an alert gaze, a powerful drive to hunt and dig, the typical high terrier energy level, and a good-natured personality. He"s intelligent, loyal, fearless, loving, and determined, and about as aggravating as any dog can be. After that intro, you may be quickly hitting the back button to hunt for a different breed — and that may be exactly what you should do. The Border Terrier is not for everyone, and before taking one home, you should be fully committed to taking his antics in stride with an amused shake of your head. But for the right people, Border Terriers are wonderful dogs who play hard and love harder. They"re ideally suited to active families who can give them plenty of exercise and prevent them from practicing their escape-artist skills. Border Terriers need a securely fenced yard to keep them safe. Given a lack of supervision and enough time alone, they"ll dig under or climb over fences to go exploring. They"ll escape through holes in fences, through open gates and doors, or by any other means they can find. In fact, they"re bred to be able to cross any wall or scramble through any wire entanglement. The drive to chase prey is another inherent part of a Border Terrier"s personality. He"ll run right in front of a car in pursuit of a cat or rabbit. A Border Terrier"s more likely to die in an accident than of old age, so be prepared to protect him from himself. It"s also important to prevent boredom. A bored Border — one who"s left alone for long periods — becomes noisy and destructive. This is not a dog that does well left out in the yard all day. You"ll likely come home to find your neighbors lined up to complain about the barking (which is meant to be heard from 10 feet underground) and your yard filled with holes indicating that your Border is well on his way to China. To keep your Border and the neighbors happy and your yard free of holes, give your Border at least half an hour per day of vigorous exercise. Besides keeping him entertained, exercise will help keep your Border trim — this small breed is prone to obesity. With their needs for companionship and activity met, Borders are happy dogs who generally get along well with everyone from children to strangers. They"ll bark at noises, making them excellent watchdogs, but don"t expect them to be fierce guard dogs if an intruder enters your home. The Border Terrier can make you laugh and cry and laugh some more. He approaches training with an independent spirit, but he wants to please. If you praise him for a job done well, he"ll quickly learn anything you can teach. He can be a handful, but he"s always the apple of his owner"s eye.
Border Terriers become overweight easily, so be sure to measure your Border"s food and give him at least a half hour of vigorous exercise each day. Border Terriers thrive when they"re with their people and aren"t meant to live outdoors with little human interaction. When left to their own devices, they can be noisy and destructive. These escape artists will find the way out of a fenced yard if given the time and opportunity. They"ve been known to climb over and dig under fences, and once they get out they have little street sense to keep them from dashing out in front of cars. Border Terriers have a high threshold for pain. If your dog"s sick, the only sign may be a behavioral change, such as the dog becoming withdrawn or quiet. Border Terriers have a natural instinct to dig. Rather than fighting it, give your Border Terrier a place of his own to dig or put his digging drive to work with fun games. Border Terriers are active and bouncy. They love jumping up on people to greet them. The Border Terrier"s coat needs weekly brushing and periodic stripping — removing the dead hair by hand or with a stripping tool — to maintain its trademark rough texture. Border Terriers love to chew. Some will grow out of chewing inappropriate items such as furniture and shoes, but others enjoy chewing throughout their lives. Giving them plenty of appropriate chew toys is the best way to avoid expensive replacements and unnecessary vet bills. Border Terriers aren"t yappy, but they"ll bark to alert you of anything unusual, and they can become nuisance barkers if they get bored. Border Terriers have a high prey drive and will chase, attack, and even kill neighborhood cats, squirrels or other small animals. They"ll also go after small pets such as rabbits, mice, or gerbils. Because of their tendency to chase, make sure your yard is securely fenced, and don"t let your Border off leash in an unfenced area. Border Terriers do well with other dogs and with family cats if the cat is raised with the Border Terrier or lived in the home before the Border Terrier. Border Terriers can make excellent companions for kids, but they can be rambunctious, especially when young, and can unintentionally hurt small children. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Border Terrier originated in northeast England, near the border with Scotland, during the 18th century. He"s a result of the neverending battle between farmers and foxes. Borders were built to have a long, narrow, flexible body, the better to squeeze through narrow holes and flush foxes out of their hiding places, and legs long enough to follow the horses during a foxhunt. Of course, they had stamina to spare, a weather-resistant coat, and thick, loose skin that wasn"t easily pierced by the teeth of their foxy adversaries. Early evidence of the breed includes a 1754 painting by Arthur Wentworth of two Border Terriers. While he was prized in England"s border country for his fearless and implacable nature, the Border Terrier was little known elsewhere. You would certainly have seen him at agricultural shows in Northumberland in the late 19th century, but on the whole dog fanciers took little notice of him until the early 20th century. In 1920, he was recognized by England"s Kennel Club, and a breed club was formed. The first Border Terrier registered in the United States was Netherbyers Ricky, in 1930. For most of his existence, the Border Terrier has been an unknown, and his people prefer that he stay that way if it means protecting him from the ravages of popularity. Currently, he ranks 81st among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
The Border Terrier is built to be big enough to keep up with hunters on horseback and small enough to squeeze into tight spaces. Males weigh 13 to 15.5 pounds; females 11.5 to 14 pounds. They stand 10 to 11 inches.
Considering that they"re terriers, Borders are pretty good-tempered, affectionate, obedient, and easily trained. They"re highly intelligent and quickly learn the cues that signal you"re going outside for a walk or to the office, when it"s mealtime, and what you like and don"t like them to chew. They"re not so affectionate with other small animals. When it comes to going after prey (even if you don"t keep them as hunting dogs), they"re fearless and relentless. Like every dog, Border Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Border Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Border Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain health conditions. Not all Border Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Border Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Hip Dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs who have hip dysplasia shouldn"t be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help. Heart defects of various kinds can affect Border Terriers, the most common of which is pulmonic stenosis, a narrowing of the valve that separates the right chamber of the heart from the lungs. If your Border Terrier has a heart murmur, it may indicate that he has a heart condition that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They"re graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and six being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets. The best way to avoid heart defects is to check that the breeder has not used dogs with heart defects in her breeding program. Malocclusions, meaning the dog"s jaws don"t fit together correctly, are sometimes found in Border Terriers. There are three different types of incorrect bites. An overshot bite is when the upper jaw extends past the lower jaw. This causes difficulties in grasping; in more severe cases, the lower teeth can bite into the roof of the mouth, causing serious injuries. An undershot bite is when the lower jaw extends out past the upper jaw. Although it is standard in some breeds, it can cause difficulties in Border Terriers and may need to be corrected with surgery. The last type of incorrect bite is wry mouth, a twisting of the mouth caused when one side grows more quickly than the other. It causes difficulties with eating and grasping. In some cases, puppies grow out of these incorrect bites, but if the bite hasn"t become normal by the time the puppy is 10 months old, it may need to be corrected surgically. If this is the case, wait until the puppy has finished growing. Corrective surgeries can include tooth extraction, crown height reductions, or the use of spacers. Dogs with incorrect bites, even if the bite is corrected surgically, should not be used for breeding. Seizures can be caused by a number of factors and can occur at any time. Signs of a seizure include sudden trembling or shaking, sudden urination, stiffness, staring, slight muscle spasms, or a loss of consciousness. Seizures aren"t curable, but they can be successfully managed with medication. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can"t maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy"s grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder"s lines. Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner.
Border Terriers are family dogs and should live indoors with their people, not tied out in the backyard — although they do enjoy having access to a yard. Just make sure the fence is high and secure — these dogs can be expert escape artists. They"ll enjoy at least a half hour of exercise daily, such as a walk on leash, off-leash play in a fenced area, or a good game of fetch. Without enough exercise, Border Terriers are prone to weight gain and boredom. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior and lots of barking. Border Terriers can be a trainer"s mixed blessing. On one hand, they"re eager to please and intelligent. They quickly learn house rules and other important dog etiquette such as housetraining, walking on leash, and greeting people politely (although they may never give up the habit of jumping up). When it comes to more advanced training, the real challenges begin. Border Terriers were developed to be independent because, during foxhunts, they had to work at a distance from their handlers. This trait is still strong in the breed, and although they may listen to a command, they"ll decide for themselves when to obey it. Even so, use a light touch; they"re sensitive and respond poorly to harsh training techniques, which will break their spirit. To train your Border Terrier, look for a trainer who understands the terrier mentality and uses positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Given a regular schedule and plenty of opportunities to go to the bathroom outside, Border Terriers are easy to housetrain. Crate training helps with housetraining and will keep your Border Terrier from chewing things while you"re away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don"t keep your Border locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Border Terrier is with you. Leash training is another must. It"s amazing how quickly a Border Terrier can run off in search of prey or adventure. This drive does not fade with age; if anything, it becomes stronger.
Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Border Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Border Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Border Terrier has a short, dense undercoat covered with a wiry topcoat. His skin is thick and loose — something that came in handy during his fox-hunting days, as it protects him from bites. The Border Terrier coat can be red, blue and tan, grizzle and tan, or wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a small patch of white on the chest. Weekly brushing and periodic stripping (every five to six months) of the rough terrier coat will keep your Border looking neat and tidy. Your grooming kit should include a fine comb, a natural bristle brush, and a stripping knife (unless you opt for having a professional groomer take care of stripping the coat). Stripping involves plucking the dead hair by hand or removing it with a stripping knife or other stripping tool. It"s the kind of thing you can do while you and your Border are watching a 30-minute television show. Your Border"s breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it — not all do. You"ll find that by stripping the coat, you"ll have less Border hair decorating your clothing, furniture, and flooring. For easier care, you can clipper the coat, but the texture and color will become softer and lighter and the coat won"t be weather resistant. If you don"t mind the scruffy look, you can just leave the coat as is, with no stripping or clipping, but the coat may shed more. Border Terriers do not need to be bathed often — only when they"ve gotten into something gross and it"s really necessary. Their coat naturally repels dirt and, with weekly brushing and a wipe-down with a damp cloth when needed, it should stay fairly clean. When you do bathe him, use a shampoo made for the rough terrier coat to help maintain its texture. Brush your Border Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don"t get caught in the carpet and tear, and don"t scratch your legs when your Border Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Start grooming your Border when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Border Terriers love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but they"re a little rambunctious for households with children under the age of 6 years. As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Border Terrier, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party. Border Terriers usually get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. They do best with dogs of the opposite sex. They"re likely to chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they shouldn"t be trusted alone with pet birds or small, furry pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils.
Border Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Border Terriers end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Border Terriers who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

With his tall, lean body, long, narrow head, and silky coat, the Borzoi is the picture of refinement and elegance. Borzois carry themselves proudly, and it"s easy to envision them lounging in the palaces of Russian Tsars or swiftly running down a wolf in the Russian countryside. But before you bring a Borzoi to your palace, you need to decide if a Borzoi is right for you. Prized for their grace as well as their sweet dispositions, Borzoi are known for their speed, juxtaposed with a laidback personality. They prefer a quick sprint to long-distance running and are then satisfied to return indoors to relax on a favorite sofa. They"re not what you"d call a high-energy dog. If you want to spend the day in bed or on the sofa, your Borzoi will be happy to spend it there with you. Despite his relaxed attitude and regal appearance, the Borzoi is not simply a beautiful showpiece for your home. This giant breed, whose height ranges from 28 to 32 inches, has a mind of his own and a desire for human companionship. He"s not the best choice for people who are away from home for long hours every day. His luxurious double coat, which kept him warm during brutal Russian winters, sheds heavily. His size is also a consideration for people with small children. The Borzoi is gentle, but puppies are enthusiastic and may accidentally knock over a toddler in play. The Borzoi"s athleticism serves him well in dog sports. Naturally, he"s beautiful in the show ring, and he can also compete well in agility, obedience, and rally. But where he shines is in the lure coursing field, exercising his natural instinct to chase. In Western states, Borzoi are sometimes used in open field coursing to hunt jackrabbit, and some farmers use them against coyotes to protect their livestock. No longer a royal hunting companion, today the Borzoi"s most important job is that of family friend. With his sweet, gentle demeanor, it"s a job at which he excels.
Borzoi are sighthounds and will chase anything that moves. They should never be allowed to run loose unless in a secure area. Borzoi can be sensitive to drugs, especially anesthetics, due to their lack of body fat. Make sure your vet is aware of this. The drug Ropum (Xylazine) should never be used for a Borzoi. Also, avoid exercising them on lawns that have been recently treated with fertilizer, insecticides, herbicides, or other chemicals. Borzoi can be fussy eaters. Borzoi can be prone to bloat. Feed frequent small meals and prevent heavy exercise after eating. Borzoi can be nervous around children and should be introduced to them at a young age if they will be in frequent contact with them. Borzoi bark infrequently and do not have strong guarding instincts. They make poor watchdogs as they cannot be relied upon to raise the alarm when an intruder is sighted. They can live successfully with cats and small animals if introduced to them at an early age. Some Borzoi only follow the "no chase" rule indoors and cannot resist the instinct to chase a running cat if outdoors. The Borzoi is not a common breed, so it may take some searching to find a breeder who has puppies. Be patient. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Once known as the Russian Wolfhound, the Borzoi"s written history can be traced to 1650, when the first standard for the breed was written in his homeland, Russia. Bred for hundreds of years by Russian nobles, the Borzoi is believed to have been developed from the early Russian bearhound, the coursing hounds of the Tatars, and the Owtchar, a tall sheepdog. The hunts of the nobles were quite the spectacle. They might involve more than one hundred Borzoi, hunted in trios of one female and two males, as well as an equal number of foxhounds, which were used to seek and flush the prey. When the wolf was sighted, the huntsmen released their dogs to capture, pin, and hold it. After they ceremoniously bound and gagged the wolf, the huntsmen sometimes set it free to be hunted again another day. These lavish hunting expeditions were common until 1861, when the serfs were emancipated and the nobles could no longer rely on an unlimited work force. By 1873, few Borzoi remained, alarming those who admired the breed"s beauty and speed. Russian fanciers created the Imperial Association to protect and promote the breed"s characteristics, and the bloodlines of many Borzoi in America can be traced to dogs from the kennels of Imperial Association members. The association"s members included Grand Duke Nicholas, the uncle of Czar Nicholas II, and Artem Boldareff, a wealthy landowner. Sadly, this association with the aristocracy was lethal. Many Borzoi were slaughtered after the Russian Revolution in 1918 because of it. The breed was saved only because many had been given as gifts to royals in other countries, including Queen Victoria and Alexandra, Princess of Wales, or had been imported by people interested in the breed. The first Borzoi known to be imported to the United States was named Elsie, purchased from Britain by a Pennsylvania man named William Wade. Poor Elsie wasn"t much to look at apparently, being described as "small, light, and weedy." Another American, C. Steadman Hanks, visited Russia in the 1890s and imported Borzoi directly from their homeland to establish his Seacroft Kennels. The first Borzoi registered with the American Kennel Club was Princess Irma in 1891. In 1903, Joseph B. Thomas contributed to the establishment of the breed in America by making three trips to Russia to purchase dogs from the Perchino Kennel of Grand Duke Nicholas and the Woronzova Kennel of Artem Boldareff. The Borzoi Club of America, then known as the Russian Wolfhound Club of America, was formed that same year. In 1936, the breed name was changed from Russian Wolfhound to Borzoi. Today, there is little difference between the Borzoi in your living room and his forebears in Mother Russia. He remains the same tall and glamorous sighthound that was one of the great treasures of Czarist Russia. The Borzoi ranks 96th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Males stand at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weigh 75 to 105 pounds. Females are at least 26 inches and weigh 55 to 85 pounds.
The gentle-spirited Borzoi personality ranges from serious and stately to clownish. As a companion, the Borzoi is quiet, sensible, and intelligent. He prefers not to be left alone for long periods. His reaction to strangers ranges from aloof to friendly. In general, he"s trusting of people and not shy. The Borzoi"s easygoing nature doesn"t necessarily mean he"s easy to train, however. He"s an independent thinker and can be stubborn. Last but not least, it"s important to the Borzoi to know that he"s loved, cared for, and will never be put in harm"s way. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Borzoi need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Borzoi puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Borzoi are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Borzoi will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Borzoi, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as gastric torsion or bloat: This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.
Borzoi are housedogs, and they like their comforts. Expect to share the furniture with them or to provide them with cozy beds throughout the house where they can rest their bones. Some do best in a home with a yard, while others are fine simply being walked every day. If you are considering a Borzoi for an apartment or condo, however, take into account whether you"ll need to carry the dog up and down the stairs if he"s ever sick or injured and can"t manage them on his own. Borzoi are not generally high-energy dogs, but activity levels vary among individuals. Some will exercise themselves if turned out into a yard while others are lazy and must be taken for a walk. Most Borzoi will be satisfied with a 20-minute walk daily and the occasional opportunity to run full out in a safely fenced area. Walks on leash or playtime in a safely fenced area are musts for this breed. The Borzoi is a sighthound, born to chase, and he"ll go after anything that"s moving, even if that means running in front of a truck. And you definitely won"t be able to catch him once he takes off. An underground electronic fence will not contain a Borzoi. The desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock. Like all hounds with a hunting heritage, Borzoi have minds of their own, which doesn"t make training easy. People who don"t understand the Borzoi mind may label them stubborn or dumb. They"re stubborn, all right, but they"re not dumb. They"re just debating whether they want to do what you"ve asked and if so, what"s in it for them. They quickly become bored with repetition, so keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. Constant positive reinforcement is the key to successfully training a Borzoi. Training through intimidation will never work. Borzoi should not be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, not only as an aid to housetraining, but also to protect your belongings and prevent your Borzoi puppy from getting into trouble when you"re not around to supervise. When introduced properly, Borzoi become very fond of their crate and will often spend time in it on their own. Be sure to provide padding to protect their bony body. A good crate size for an adult Borzoi is 26 inches wide by 36 inches high by 48 inches long. Borzoi puppies are slow to mature, so don"t expect puppy destructiveness to disappear any time soon. You can alleviate it by providing your Borzoi with plenty of exercise and companionship.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Borzoi are prone to gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat. The likelihood of this often-fatal condition can be decreased by feeding the Borzoi two or more small meals daily rather than a single large meal and avoiding exercise for a couple of hours before and after mealtime. Keep your Borzoi in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Borzoi, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Borzoi"s long, silky coat, which can be any color or combination of colors, may be flat, wavy, or curly. Short, smooth hair covers the head, ears, and front of legs, and a profuse, curly frill adorns the neck. Thick feathering covers the tail and rear end. The hair"s beautiful silky texture is resistant to dirt and mud, so it"s easy to keep clean. Brush your Borzoi"s coat weekly with a pin brush. Be sure to remove any mats from behind the ears or between the hind legs. Avoid using a wire slicker brush, which can ruin the coat. Borzoi are seasonally heavy shedders and may need brushing more frequently during that time. Bathe him as needed. Brush your Borzoi"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Borzoi enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Borzoi to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Borzoi can be too large for a household with small children, especially toddlers. They"re giant dogs and can easily knock over a child by accident. Nor are they especially tolerant of toddlers poking and prodding them. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Generally, Borzoi aren"t aggressive toward other dogs, although in an uncontrolled situation their sighthound heritage may take over, especially if small dogs are running around. Some can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex. With training, young Borzoi can learn not to chase or snap at smaller household pets, including cats. That training may only hold indoors, however. Cats outdoors — even your own cat — may be viewed as fair game.
Borzoi are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in need of adoption and or fostering. National Borzoi Rescue Foundation Borzoi Club of America

The Boston Terrier may have been bred to be a ferocious pit-fighter, but you"d never know it today. The little American Gentleman, as he was called in the 19th century, is definitely a lover, not a fighter, although males have been known to show their terrier ancestry with a bit of posturing when they feel their territory is being invaded by another dog. Boston Terriers are known for being very intelligent — sometimes too much so. Their lively, affectionate nature makes them extremely loveable, though their sometimes stubborn nature or spurts of hyperactivity can land them in hot water with their owners. Any angst about their behavior, however, soon melts when they look up at you with those huge, round eyes that seem to say "I love you." Although Boston Terriers are small, they"re sturdy and muscular. They have a sleek, shiny, straight coat with crisp white markings in a pattern that resembles a tuxedo — part of the reason they gained the name American Gentleman. Boston Terriers" distinctive ears naturally stand erect and are quite large. And then there"s those big, beautiful eyes that are set quite apart to add to their outstanding good looks. Boston Terriers have a broad, flat-nosed face without wrinkles. They belong to a class of dogs called brachycephalic (brachy meaning short, and cephalic meaning head). Like other brachycephalic dogs, the lower jaw is in proportion to the body, but they have a short upper jaw to give them a "pushed in" face. Boston Terriers" carriage give them a presence that goes beyond their size. They have a slightly arched, proud neckline, a broad chest, and a sturdy, boxy appearance. Their tail is naturally short (docking is forbidden) and set low on the rump. The Boston Terrier"s small size and lively, affectionate nature make him a great family pet and companion. They love children and amuse people of all ages with their antics and unique, appealing expression. They are especially good companions for older people and apartment dwellers. Although gentle and even-tempered, they can have the spunky attitude of their terrier ancestors.
Short-nosed dogs like Boston Terriers can"t cool the air going into their lungs as efficiently as longer-nosed breeds, and they"re much more susceptible to heat stress. Because of their short coat, they can"t stand extremely cold weather either. Even in temperate climates, the Boston Terrier should be kept indoors. Because Boston Terriers can have respiratory problems, avoid pulling on your dog"s collar to get him to go what you want. Your Boston Terrier is prone to corneal ulcers because his eyes are so large and prominent. Be careful about his eyes when you"re playing or taking him for a walk. Depending in part upon their diets, Boston Terriers can be prone to flatulence. If you can"t tolerate a gassy dog, a Boston Terrier may not be for you. Because of their short noses, Boston Terriers often snort, drool, and snore (sometimes loudly). With their large heads and small pelvises, whelping isn"t easy for Boston Terrier mothers. If you have thoughts about breeding, be sure you realize that in addition to the potential whelping problems that often require a caesarean section, Boston Terrier litters typically are not large (a litter consisting of only one puppy is not uncommon). You may have to wait for several months to get a good quality Boston Terrier puppy from a qualified breeder. While Boston Terriers typically are quiet, gentle dogs, not prone to yappiness or aggression, males can be scrappy around other dogs that they feel are invading their territory. Boston Terriers can be gluttonous about their food, so monitor their condition and make sure they don"t become overweight. They can be stubborn, so persistence and consistency are definite pluses in training methods. They are sensitive to your tone of voice, and punishment can make them shut down, so training should be low-key and motivational. Crate-training is recommended while housetraining your Boston Terrier. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Although everyone agrees that the Boston Terrier came into existence in the late 1800s in Boston, Massachusetts, there are varying stories about how the breed came to be. One story has it that coachmen of wealthy families developed the breed by crossing Bulldogs and the now extinct English White Terrier to create a new dog-fighting breed. Another account is that a Bostonian named Robert C. Hooper imported an Bulldog/English Terrier cross named Judge from England in 1865 because he reminded Hooper of a dog he"d had in his childhood. Yet another story is that Hooper purchased Judge from another Bostonian, William O"Brian, around 1870. While we may never know which story is true, the fact is that there was, indeed, a dog named Judge, and that from him, came the breed we know today as the Boston Terrier. According to The Complete Dog Book, Judge was "a well-built, high-stationed dog" weighing about 32 pounds. He was a dark brindle color with a white blaze on his face and a square, blocky head. Amazingly, Judge was bred only once. From a union with a 20-pound white dog named Burnett"s Gyp (or Kate) who belonged to Edward Burnett, of Southboro, Massachusetts, came one puppy, a male named Well"s Eph. By all accounts, Judge and Kate"s offspring wasn"t an attractive dog, but he had other characteristics that Hooper and his friends admired, so he was widely bred. One of his matings was to a female named Tobin"s Kate, who weighed only 20 pounds and had a fairly short head. She was a golden brindle color and had a straight three-quarter tail. It"s thought that their offspring was bred with one or more French Bulldogs to form the foundation for the Boston Terrier we know today. But they weren"t called Boston Terriers in the beginning. The multitude of Eph"s offspring were called by various names, including bullet heads, round-headed bull-and-terriers, American terriers, and Boston bulldogs. In 1889, about 30 owners of Boston Bull Terriers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, and they called them Round Heads or Bull Terriers. Bull Terrier and Bulldog fanciers objected to the name. Since the Bulldog contingency had a lot of power with the American Kennel Club (AKC) at that time, the Boston Bull Terrier fanciers decided that discretion was the better part of valor and changed the name of their club to the Boston Terrier Club, in tribute to the birthplace of the breed. People started referring to the breed as Boston Bulls. The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1893. The Boston Terrier was one of the first Non-Sporting dogs bred in the U.S. and was the first of the 10 made-in-America breeds currently recognized by the AKC. In the early days, the breed"s color and markings weren"t considered to be very important. Additionally, although the dogs being bred met the standard outlined by the club, there was a lot of inconsistency within the breed. After years of careful inbreeding to set the type, the Boston Terrier as we know it today was developed. In the 1900s, the breed"s distinctive markings and color were painstakingly written into the standard, making them an essential feature of the breed. Boston Terriers quickly became popular in the U.S. In 1915, Boston Terriers were the most popular breed in the U.S., remaining in the top ten most popular breeds until the 1960s and topping the list again in 1920 and 1930. In 1918, there were an amazing 60 Bostons entered in a single all-breed show. Hollywood actors and actresses adored their Boston Terriers. Silent film star Pola Negri, Rudolph Valentino"s lover, reportedly took her Boston Terrier, Patsy, with her everywhere, including restaurants and nightclubs. When one of the restaurants refused to let her enter with her beloved dog, she stormed out, shouting "No Patsy, no Pola. Goodbye forever!" Another famous person who had a Boston Terrier named Patsy was gossip columnist Louella Parsons. In 1976, the Boston Terrier was chosen as the bicentennial dog of the U.S. Three years later, he was named the official state dog of Massachusetts. Rhett the Boston Terrier is the mascot of Boston University. Wofford College in South Carolina and Redlands High School in California claim the Boston Terrier as their mascots as well.
The Boston Terrier comes in three weight classes: under 15 pounds, 15 to 19 pounds, and 20 to 25 pounds. They typically stand 12 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder. No matter what they weigh, they should look sturdy, never skinny or spindly.
Known as the American Gentleman, the Boston Terrier is lively, smart, and affectionate with a gentle, even temperament. They can, however, be stubborn, so persistence and consistency are definite musts when training. Like every dog, the Boston Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Boston puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Boston Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Boston Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Boston Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website (offa.org). Cataracts: This is a clouded film over the eye lens. Boston Terriers are prone to developing both juvenile and adult cataracts. Juvenile cataracts develop between eight weeks of age and 12 months. While you can sometimes see juvenile cataracts, sometimes they can only be detected by a veterinary ophthalmologist using a CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) test. When purchasing a Boston Terrier puppy, it"s wise to ask the breeder if the puppy has been tested for juvenile cataracts. Cherry eye: Cherry eye is a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid that is believed to be genetic in origin. It frequently occurs in dogs that are less than a year old. Some veterinarians reposition the gland surgically to its original site at the base of the third eyelid, while others remove the prolapsed gland altogether. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Heart murmurs: This is a soft or loud, harsh, regurgitant sound in the heart, especially over the mitral valve area where a defect causes a backflowing of blood into the left atrium. Because of this, the heart is not as efficient as it should be in providing blood to the body. Treatment often includes a low-sodium diet, restriction of exercise, diuretics, and medications. Deafness: Boston Terriers have a high incidence of deafness in one or both ears. Breeders should have puppies BAER tested to determine the status of the puppies" ears before they go to new homes. Note that Boston Terriers who are white over more than one-third of their heads and/or bodies tend to produce more deaf puppies. Brain tumors. Allergies: Boston Terriers can suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. If your Boston is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, he may have an allergy. Allergies can be diagnosed by your vet. Megaesophagus: This is a defect in the structure of the esophagus that causes a dog to regurgitate its undigested food. Regurgitation differs from vomiting in that there generally is no advance warning that it will occur, whereas with vomiting there is visible effort involved. Reverse sneezing: Reverse sneezing is a condition that can occur at any time in your Boston Terrier"s life. Generally it occurs when your dog is overly excited, gulps his food too fast, or is affected by pollen in the air. Nasal secretions drop onto the soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe. The dog makes a wheezing sound and may become alarmed. Talk soothingly to him and try to get him to relax to shorten the episode. Some people say that pinching the nostrils closed or holding the palm of your hand over his nose so the dog is forced to breathe through his mouth is the quickest way to stop the reverse sneezing. You may also try stroking his throat.
The Boston Terrier is a lively dog, but he doesn"t have excessive exercise requirements. He"s relatively inactive indoors and well suited for apartment dwellers or those who don"t have a yard. He enjoys taking a walk with you and playing in a yard, but is definitely an indoor dog and should never be housed outside. Always keep in mind that Boston Terriers can"t handle the heat or cold very well. Bostons are sensitive to your tone of voice, and punishment can make them shut down, so training should be low-key and motivational. Use positive techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.
Recommended daily amount: 0.5 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Boston Terriers can be gluttonous about their food, so monitor their condition and make sure they don"t become overweight. They can also be prone to flatulence, which may be related to their diet. Feed a high-quality food to reduce the likelihood of this problem. For more on feeding your Boston Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog .
Perennially on the best-dressed list, the Boston Terrier wears a smooth, fine coat that comes in three colors: black, seal (looks black but has a reddish cast when seen in sunlight), or brindle, all with a white muzzle, face blaze, and chest, giving him the look of wearing a tuxedo. Boston Terriers don"t come in solid colors such as black, gray, liver, or white. Be wary of breeders who try to sell you one of these dogs because of the "rare" color. Not sticking to the breed standard is a warning sign of a low-quality breeder. Boston Terriers are easy to groom. Brush them weekly with a firm bristle brush and bathe them with a dry, powder shampoo and a damp cloth, or give them an occasional bath when necessary. Because their eyes are so large and prominent, you should wash their faces every day and check their eyes for signs of redness or irritation. Although they do shed, it"s minimal and should be easily controlled by regular brushing. Brush your Boston Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Boston Terrier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Boston Terrier loves children and makes a good playmate for them. He"s small enough that he won"t knock them down but large enough that he"s not easily injured. In general, he gets along well with other dogs and cats, especially if he"s socialized to them at an early age.
Boston Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Boston Terriers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Boston Terrier rescue.

With his tousled coat and powerful build, the Bouvier des Flandres embodies a rugged adventurer packed with strength, endurance, and vigor. Originally bred to be a hard-working farm dog, he aslo makes a great family pet who thrives among the people he loves. While his appearance is striking, the appeal of this dog is often found in his intelligent and serene nature. As a member of the Herding Group, he has a tendency to herd moving objects, including children, people on bikes, and joggers. He is naturally protective of his "flock," and will defend his family should the need arise. However, he is not aggressive without cause. Fearless and confident with a strong personality, the Bouvier is a natural athlete outdoors, but he is also happy hanging out with you inside. While not terribly high-energy, he does need vigorous exercise to keep healthy. He can live comfortably in small quarters, such as a condo or apartment, but it"s important he is walked or exercised several times a day. The Bouvier does well with training and generally learns quickly. Still, since he can be strong-willed and sometimes stubborn, he"s not recommended for first-time or timid owners. Neither is he recommended for owners who can"t stand a mess. His shaggy coat is a mud-burr-dirt magnet so he"s prone to tracking dirt and debris throughout the house. Perhaps most annoying is his amazingly odiferous flatulence. For those, however, who embrace his strong personality, extreme grooming needs, large size, and protective nature, the Bouvier can be a great choice.
The Bouvier is not recommended for fastidious people who can"t stand a mess. Although he can be tidied up with a significant amount of elbow grease, his coat tends to collect dirt and debris, which in turn is deposited throughout your house. Not surprisingly, the Bouvier requires a lot of grooming — which can be time-intensive and/or expensive. Because of his assertive personality, this breed is not recommended for first-time dog owners. The Bouvier"s size, herding instinct, and strong personality make leash training highly advisable. The Bouvier is happiest when he is with his family.
As you might expect, the Bouvier des Flandres originates from the European region of Flandres, and the name means either "cow herder" or "ox herder from Flandres." A versatile farm dog, the Bouvier was used to herd cattle, guard the herd, pull carts, and help the farmer and his family in a multitude of tasks. The development of the working Bouvier seemed to be a matter of practicality. His exact ancestry is unknown, but he may be descended from early Sheepdogs, the Dutch Griffon, and the Barbet. The Bouvier worked as a service dog during both World Wars, and was also used as a messenger, a sentry (especially by the United States military), and a search dog to locate ammunition and mines. The first standard for the Bouvier was developed in 1912 by the vice president of the Club St. Hubert du Nord in Europe. The Bouvier came to the United States in the 1920s, and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1929. The breed"s working heritage is highly prized. In Belgium, a Bouvier cannot win the title of conformation champion unless he has also proven himself as a working dog.
Males stand about 26 inches tall and females stand about 25 inches tall. Weight varies from 70 to 100 pounds.
The Bouvier is known for being intelligent, protective, and strong willed. Not surprisingly, this herding dog likes to gather and protect his flock. He is deeply attached and devoted to his family, and happiest when he"s a part of the action. Left alone for long periods of time, he"s like to get bored — and resort to annoying behaviors like barking, chasing, and chewing — as well as become very unhappy. The Bouvier maintains a stiff upper lip, however, when it comes to showing affection for his family. He is not likely to jump for joy, Golden Retriever-style, when you return home, but is more likely to quietly show his devotion by curling up at your feet. The Bouvier has a strong personality: He needs an owner who can kindly and consistently show leadership, otherwise, he"s likely to fill the void. This doesn"t mean you should take a drill sergeant approach, but you must act the confident leader and consistently, albeit gently, enforce guidelines. Like every dog, the Bouvier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bouvier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Bouviers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bouviers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops. Entropion: This is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment. Ectropion: Another eye condition, Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritations and infection. If severe, surgery is required, but in mild cases, no treatment is necessary. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This is a heart problem is caused by an abnormally narrow connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. Fainting is the main symptom, eventually leading to heart failure and death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bouviers. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this is an extremely serious condition caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Symptoms include vomiting, a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to misdiagnose until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe symptoms occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Cushing"s Disease: Also known as hyperadrenocorticism, this condition sets in when the body produces too much cortisol, sometimes due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Bouvier exhibits these two symptoms, take him to the veterinarian. Treatments include surgery and medication. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bouviers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Bouvier des Flandres is happy to lie around the house and enjoy the luxuries of companionship. He isn"t highly active, but he does need regular exercise. He lives comfortably in the city or country. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Bouvier puppy. Like other large breeds, the Bouvier grows very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making him susceptible to bone disorders. Don"t let your Bouvier puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement or pull a cart until he"s full grown and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility play, with its one-inch jumps. Training should begin the day you bring your Bouvier puppy home. He is generally eager to please so training is fairly easy. But he can be stubborn, so owners must be consistent and firm to overcome his dominant personality. Another important step in training a Bouvier des Flandres puppy is socialization. Socialization is the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people. The Bouvier can be suspicious of strangers and very protective of his family — good qualities for a herding dog. Socialization will prevent him from becoming overly shy or protective. You can take the Bouvier puppy to many places that allow dogs, like pet supply and building supply stores to familiarize the dog to strangers and unfamiliar situations. Puppy training classes are highly recommended. Crate training is an important aid in housetraining, and it keeps the Bouvier safe and out of trouble when you are away from home. But he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Bouviers aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Leash training is a must with the Bouvier. Although the breed is not known for wandering off, he is known for a strong herding drive. He may be unable to resist the temptation to chase people on bikes, cars, or other animals, which can endanger him and others. Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young. You can choose to crop his ears, or not. It requires surgery and several months of care after. If you like the look of cropped ears, factor in the care and expense, as well.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Bouvier puppy. Like other large breeds, the Bouvier grows very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making him susceptible to bone disorders. Feed your puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast (22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat). NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Bouvier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Bouvier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bouvier des Flandres is blessed (or cursed, depending on you look at it) with a weather-resistant double coat. The outer coat is coarse and long; the undercoat is fine and dense. It appears in several colors, including fawn, black, salt and pepper, and brindle, and sometimes a white star is found on the chest. While he doesn"t shed excessively, the handsome Bouvier does require quite a bit of grooming to keep his coat looking good. (It is important to begin this process when the Bouvier is a young puppy so he learns to accept grooming as a normal part of life.) His Dutch nickname, Vuilbaard, means "dirty beard," and like all dogs with a fluffy coat, the Bouvier gets grubby fairly easily. Expect muddy paws, leaves or burrs, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet, dirty beard. The Bouvier"s thick coat needs to be brushed several times a week, and it"s a great idea to check the coat for burrs, ticks, or weeds every day. Bathe him every six to eight weeks, and trim his coat every few months. Many owners hire a professional to groom their Bouvier, though you still need to brush thoroughly on a very regular basis. If you are considering the Bouvier, consider the time and/or expense required for his upkeep. Brush your Bouvier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Bouvier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Bouvier is a wonderful family dog who is devoted and protective with his family, including children. He may wish to herd his children with nudges and barks. To best teach him to get along with kids, he should be raised with them or, if he doesn"t live with them, he should be exposed to children as he grows up. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Bouvier should be raised with other dogs and animals for the best chance at getting along with them when he grows up. If he is socialized and trained properly, he usually just ignores other animals in his household. Buy hid instinct to herd and chase is strong, supervision is always a good idea.
Bouviers are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Bouviers in need of adoption and or fostering. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Bouvier rescue. American Bouvier Rescue League

Boxers are large, muscular, square-headed dogs who look imposing — that is, until you look into their eyes and see the mischief and joy of life reflected there. Because of their playful nature and boundless energy, they are sometimes called the "Peter Pan" of the dog breeds. Boxers aren"t considered fully mature until they are three years old, meaning they have one of the longest puppyhoods in the world of dogs.The typical Boxer is intelligent, alert, and fearless, yet friendly. He"s loyal to his family and loves to play with them, but he"s also headstrong, especially if you try to use harsh training methods with him.With minimal grooming needs and legendary patience and gentleness with children, Boxers are great family companions, as long as you provide them with the physical exercise and mental stimulation they need. If you"re willing and able to provide them with adequate exercise in the form of walks or runs, they can even adapt to apartment living, so long as they are able to be close to their beloved people.Boxers originated in Germany and were brought to the U.S. after World War I. Their short, shiny coats are striking: fawn or brindle with flashy white markings. All white or mostly white Boxers are not desirable because genetically, deafness is associated with white coloring.Many Boxers have docked tails and cropped ears. If the ears are not cropped, they will hang down. Many dog owners are opting to leave their Boxers" ears uncropped these days.Boxers are renowned for their great love of and loyalty to their families. They often are distrustful of strangers at first, but will not be aggressive unless they perceive a threat to their families. Boxers are so loving that they often think they are lapdogs and try to lie as close to you as possible.Boxer owners around the world take special delight in their beloved dogs" clownish behavior. Boxers are high-spirited, happy, and energetic. They often paw, cat-like, at their toys, food bowls, and even their owners. When they are excited, they often "kidney bean," a little dance that involves twisting their bodies into a semi-circle, similar to the shape of a kidney bean, and then turning in circles. Boxers also make a unique sound, called a "woo-woo," when they want something or are excited. It is not exactly a bark, but rather sounds as though they are saying "woo-woo," look at me!Watching a Boxer run is a delight. They are so exuberant, happy, and graceful, it"s sure to bring a smile to your face, especially if they start jumping (something they love to do), twisting, and even turning somersaults to entertain you.But life isn"t all fun and games for all Boxers. Because of their strength and courage, Boxers have a wide use in the military and the police, as well as search-and-rescue work. When specifically trained for guard work, Boxers are excellent watchdogs and will restrain an intruder in the same manner as a Mastiff. Boxers also excel in obedience, agility, and schutzhund (a demanding three-phase competition event that tests the dog"s tracking, obedience, and protection abilities).Boxers should not be left outdoors for extended periods of time. Their short nose doesn"t cool hot air efficiently in the summer, and their short coat doesn"t keep them warm in the winter. Many Boxer people joke that their Boxers" range of tolerance is between 72 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit (21-22 degrees Celsius).Boxers aren"t the breed for everyone, but if you like a big dog who likes to cuddle, don"t mind a little drool between friends, want a dog that will delight you with his clownish antics and yet be gentle with your children, and most of all, if you are prepared to keep your Boxer physically and mentally stimulated, the Boxer just might be the right dog for you!
Boxers are high-energy dogs and need a lot of exercise. Make sure you have the time, desire, and energy to give them the play and activity they need. Boxers are exuberant and will greet you ecstatically. Early, consistent training is critical — before your Boxer gets too big to handle! Although they are large, Boxers are not "outdoor dogs." Their short noses and short hair make them uncomfortable in hot and cold weather, and they need to be kept as housedogs. Boxers mature slowly and act like rambunctious puppies for several years. Boxers don"t just like to be around their family — they need to be around them! If left alone for too long or kept in the backyard away from people, they can become ill-tempered and destructive. Boxers drool, a lot. Boxers also snore, loudly. Although they have short hair, Boxers shed, especially in the spring. Boxers are intelligent and respond well to firm but fun training. They also have an independent streak and don"t like to be bossed around or treated harshly. You"ll have the biggest success in training your Boxer if you can make it fun for him. Some Boxers take their guarding duties a little too seriously, while others may not exhibit any guarding instincts at all. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Boxer"s ancestors were the German Bullenbeisser (a dog that descended from Mastiffs) and the Bulldog. The Bullenbeisser had been used as a hunting dog for centuries to hunt bear, wild boar, and deer. Its task was to catch and hold the prey until hunters arrived. Over time, Bullenbeissers lost their jobs on estates and began to be used by farmers and butchers to guard and drive cattle.The Boxer we know today was developed in the late 19th century. A Munich man named Georg Alt bred a brindle-colored female Bullenbeisser named Flora with a local dog of unknown origin. In the litter was a fawn-and-white male that was named Lechner"s Box. This is believed to be the start of the line that would become the Boxer we know today.Lechner"s Box was bred to his dam, Flora, and one of the litter was a female called Alt"s Schecken. She was registered as a Bierboxer or Modern Bullenbeiser. Schecken was then bred to an English Bulldog named Tom to produce a dog named Flocki, who became the first Boxer to be entered in the German Stud Book after winning at a Munich show that had a special event for Boxers.Flocki"s sister, a white female, was even more influential when she was mated with Piccolo von Angertor, a grandson of Lechner"s Box. One of her pups was a white female named Meta von der Passage, who is considered to be the mother of the Boxer breed even though photographs of her show that she bore little resemblance to the modern Boxer. John Wagner, author of The Boxer (first published in 1939) said the following about her:"Meta von der Passage played the most important role of the five original ancestors. Our great line of sires all trace directly back to this female. She was a substantially built, low to the ground, brindle and white parti-color, lacking in underjaw and exceedingly lippy. As a producing bitch few in any breed can match her record. She consistently whelped puppies of marvelous type and rare quality. Those of her offspring sired by Flock St. Salvator and Wotan dominate all present-day."In 1894, three Germans named Roberth, Konig, and Hopner decided to stabilize the breed and put it on exhibition at a dog show. This was done in Munich in 1895, and the next year they founded the first Boxer Club.The breed became known in other parts of Europe in the late 1890s. Around 1903, the first Boxers were imported into the U.S. The first Boxer was registered by the American Kennel Club in 1904, a dog named Arnulf Grandenz. In 1915, the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the first Boxer champion, Sieger Dampf v Dom, owned by Governor and Mrs. Lehman of New York. Unfortunately, there weren"t many female Boxers in the U.S. to breed to him, so he didn"t have much influence on the breed.When Word War I broke out, Boxers were enlisted into the military, serving as messenger dogs, carrying packs, and acting as attack and guard dogs.Boxers started becoming popular in the U.S. in the 1940s when soldiers coming home from World War II brought their Boxer mascots with them. Through them, the breed was introduced to more people and soon became a favorite companion animal, show dog, and guard dog.The American Boxer Club (ABC) was formed in 1935 and gained acceptance by the AKC in the same year. In the early days, there was a lot of controversy within the club about the Boxer standard. In 1938, the club finally approved a new standard. The latest revisions of the standard were in 2005. Today, the Boxer ranks 7th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Males typically stand 22.5 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh about 70 pounds. Females typically stand 21 to 23.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh about 60 pounds.
The Boxer is described as a "hearing" guard dog, meaning he"s alert and watchful. When he"s not clowning for you, he"s dignified and self-assured. With children, he"s playful and patient. Strangers are greeted with a wary attitude, but he responds politely to friendly people. He"s aggressive only in defense of his family and home.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Boxers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Boxer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Boxers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Boxers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Boxers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cancer. Boxers are especially prone to the developing mast cell tumors, lymphoma, and brain tumors. White Boxers and Boxers with excessive white markings can be sunburned and may even develop skin cancer. If your Boxer is light-colored, apply sunscreen on his ears, nose, and coat when he goes outdoors. Aortic stenosis/sub-aortic stenosis (AS/SAS). This is one of the most common heart defects found in Boxers. The aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It"s an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn"t known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Dogs with this condition should not be bred. Boxer cardiomyopathy (BCM). Also called Boxer Arrythmic Cardiomyopathy (BAC), Familial Ventricular Arrhythmia (FVA) and Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BCM is an inherited condition. The dog" heart sometimes beats erratically (arrhythmia) due to an electrical conduction disorder. This can cause weakness, collapse, or sudden death. Because it is difficult to detect this condition, it can cause an unexpected death. Boxers who show signs of this condition should not be bred. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Treatment ranges from supplements that support joint function to total hip replacement. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Corneal Dystrophy: This refers to several diseases of the eye that are non-inflammatory and inherited. One or more layers of the cornea in both eyes are usually affected, although not necessarily symmetrically. In most breeds, corneal dystrophy appears as an opaque area in the center of the cornea or close to the periphery. This usually isn"t painful unless corneal ulcers develop. Demodectic Mange: Also called Demodicosis. All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems. If your Boxer has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, he can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange, also called demodicosis, can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link to its development. The third form of this disease, Demodectic Pododermititis, is confined to the paws and can cause deep infections. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like Boxers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and type of food might be additional factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed. Allergies: Boxers are prone to allergies, both environmental allergies and food-related allergies. If you notice that your Boxer has itchy, scaly skin, have him checked out by your vet. Deafness: White Boxers are especially susceptible to deafness. About 20 percent of white Boxers are deaf, and white Boxers should not be bred because the genes that cause deafness in white Boxers can be inherited. Additionally, Boxers that carry the extreme white spotting gene can increase the incidence of deafness in the breed.
Boxers are housedogs. Their short noses and short coats make them unsuited to living outdoors, although they"ll enjoy having a fenced yard to play in.Boxers love to play. To keep their muscles toned and satisfy their need for exercise, plan on playing with them or walking them at least twice a day for half an hour. Play fetch, take him for long walks, or get him involved in dog sports such as agility or flyball. Giving your Boxer plenty of daily exercise is the best way to ensure good behavior. A tired Boxer is a good Boxer.Training is essential for the Boxer. He"s so big and strong that he can accidentally hurt people by knocking them over if he doesn"t learn to control his actions. The Boxer"s temperament plays a role in his trainability. He"s happy and excitable, bouncy, and a bit of a mischief-maker. Getting him to take training seriously requires starting early and using firm, fair training methods and positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. Be consistent. Your Boxer will notice any time you let him get away with something, and he"ll push to see what else he can get away with. Before you head to training class, settle him down a little with an energetic walk or play session. He"ll focus better once he"s got his ya-yas out.Patience is the key to housetraining your Boxer. Some are housetrained by 4 months of age, but others aren"t reliable until they"re 7 months to a year old. Take your Boxer out to potty on a regular schedule and praise him wildly when he does his business outdoors. Crate training is recommended.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Boxer trim by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Boxer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Boxers have a sleek, short coat with tight skin over their athletic bodies. They come in two colors: fawn or brindle, with or without white markings. Fawn ranges from light tan to mahogany. Brindle is a striking tiger-striped pattern of black stripes on a fawn background.White markings usually appear on the belly or feet and shouldn"t cover more than one-third of the coat. When the white extends onto the neck or face, the color is called flashy fawn or flashy brindle. Boxers without any white are referred to as plain Boxers. On the face, the Boxer has a black mask, sometimes with a white stripe, or blaze, running up the muzzle between the eyes.Boxers don"t carry the gene for a solid black coat color, so you won"t ever see a black Boxer. In the United Kingdom, fawn boxers are typically rich in color and are called "red."White markings covering more than one third of the body is a disqualification in the show ring. That"s because excessive white markings in Boxers make them more susceptible to health conditions such as skin cancer and deafness. Reputable breeders don"t want to pass on those genes. In the past, breeders often euthanized white puppies at birth, but today most breeders place them in pet homes. While white Boxers can"t be shown in conformation and shouldn"t be bred, they can compete in obedience and agility, and of course, they still have the wonderful Boxer personality that makes them such great companions!The Boxer coat requires minimal grooming. Boxers are clean dogs and have been known to groom themselves like cats do. Boxers can shed quite a bit, but weekly brushing with a bristle brush or hard rubber grooming mitt will help keep hair under control. You can enhance the natural sheen of your Boxer"s coat by rubbing it down every now and then with a chamois cloth. If you decide to use a shedding blade, be careful when using it around your Boxer"s legs so you don"t injure him. Bathe as needed.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Boxer"s teeth several times a week to help remove tartar and bacteria. Daily is best if you want to prevent periodontal disease.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Boxer enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Boxer to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Boxers love kids and are great playmates for active older children. They can be too rambunctious for toddlers, however, and can accidentally knock them down in play.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Boxers can get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re raised with them.
Boxers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Boxers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Boxer rescue.

In his homeland of Italy, the Bracco (plural is Bracchi) is primarily a hunting dog, but people are starting to discover that this attractive dog with the noble appearance and pleasant personality is also an excellent companion and show dog. Also known as the Italian Pointer, the Bracco is capable of all types of hunting and both points and retrieves. In the home, he"s calm and sweet. Train this intelligent dog with gentleness and consistency and he"ll always aim to please, but sharp corrections will cause him to stop trying. Ever alert, he"ll probably bark when people approach the home, but he"s too gentle to make a guard dog. The Bracco is accepting of other people and dogs, children, and even cats if he"s raised with them.

Often called "a heart wrapped in fur," the Briard makes a great family dog. He is devoted to his owner, happiest following you around the house while you do chores or watching you watch television on a rainy day. The Briard is an ideal companion for someone who wants a lovable, but not overly dependent, dog. A member of the Herding Group, he weighs in at around 75 pounds and lives comfortably in the country or city — as long as he"s with his family and gets sufficient exercise. The Briard is an intelligent breed and a quick study when it comes to training, though he can be stubborn and want to do things his own way. Owners must be prepared to establish pack leadership from an early age or the dog is likely to take a shot at the role himself. With a strong instinct to herd, it"s not unusual for him to try to gather or keep the children or adults in his family within certain boundaries. He may nudge, push, or bark at his "flock." The Briard"s wariness of strangers makes him an excellent guard dog, and he"s forever ready to defend his family and territory if he perceives danger. With the proper training and socialization, however, you can encourage him to be more accepting of outsiders. A Briard puppy should be introduced to many new and different people, places, and situations during the first year of his life. These early experiences help ensure you have an adult Briard with a positive outlook on life. There are exceptions, of course, but for the most part, the Briard does extremely well with children. If you"re bringing a Briard pup —  or any dog — into a house with kids, it"s important to teach both how to interact with each other. If you do not have children, but plan on doing so in the next few years, it"s essential that you socialize your puppy to children.
The Briard needs daily grooming. Although his coat is considered low- to non-shedding, it tangles and matts easily. If you do not have the time or patience for grooming, consider another breed. The Briard is naturally independent, which is a wonderful quality if your puppy has been trained properly. However, without training, that independent, confident puppy can turn into an unmanageable adult. The Briard must be socialized early to avoid aggression toward people or animals he doesn"t know. Briards were bred to be guard dogs and still take this role seriously. The Briard enjoys being with his owner. He does best when he is allowed to hang out with the people he loves. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Briard originated in France and can be dated back to the 8th century. He was known as the Chien Berger De Brie, which is believed to be derived from his place of origin, the region of Brie (although the Briard was found in many parts of France). A more romantic explanation exists as well — that is, the name is a distortion of Chien d"Aubry. A 14th century legend claims that Aubry de Montdidier, a courtier of King Charles V, built a cathedral in memory of a valiant Briard who saved his son"s life. Regardless of the origin of the name, the Briard can be linked back to the Emperor Charlemagne through his depiction in early tapestries. The Briard has also been linked to Napoleon and was the official breed of the French Army. It is believed that Thomas Jefferson imported the first Briards to the United States, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1928. Surprisingly, the Briard was not introduced to the United Kingdom until the late 1960s.
Males stand 23 to 27 inches tall and females stand 22 to 25.5 inches tall. Most Briards weigh between 70 and 90 pounds, though some males can reach 100 pounds.
The typical Briard is brave, loyal, and intelligent. He is good-natured and loving with his family, and thrives on participating in family activities. In spite of his large size, he is essentially a housedog. He doesn"t belong in the backyard by himself, but curled up next to you while you sip mint tea. A protective guardian, the Briard can be aloof with strangers. He also can be stubborn and willful, but with plenty of encouragement and positive reinforcement, he can be persuaded to come around on both counts. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents —  usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like any dog, the Briard can become timid if he is not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences —  when he is young. Primary socialization should be with people outside the household. Socialization helps ensure that your Briard puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Briards are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Briards will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Briards, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB): CNSB affects dogs in varying degrees. It can be as slight as difficulty moving in poor light to total blindness in a dim light; it can also mean complete blindness in any light. Research is underway for genetic testing. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Cancer: Symptoms of canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Briards. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.
The Briard can adapt to city or country life. He is a fairly calm breed when inside, but he does need 30 to 60 minutes of exercise daily. Without enough activity, the Briard can become bored, paving the way for annoying or destructive behaviors like barking, digging, chasing, and chewing. Dog sports, especially herding trials, are a good outlet for his energy and hone his natural herding ability. The Briard puppy must learn who the pack leader is or he"ll try to assume the position; therefore, training should start as soon as the Briard puppy comes home. This doesn"t mean he should know advanced commands by 9 weeks of age, but he should be learning proper manners and rules of the house right away. Crate training can be an important aid — it helps with housetraining and keeps your pup safe when you"re away — but remember that he should be with the family (not in his crate) when you are at home. Because the Briard is naturally suspicious of people outside his "flock," it is important to encourage your Briard puppy to be friendly with strangers. If a Briard is not properly socialized and trained, it can lead to aggression toward people or animals he considers a threat.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Briard in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Briard, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Although considered a low- to non-shedding breed, the Briard has an outer coat and undercoat. The outer coat is slightly wavy with a coarse texture, about six inches long, while the undercoat is soft and fine. You"ll see it in a variety of colors, or combination of colors, including black and shades of gray and tawny. Do you have several hours a week you can devote to grooming your Briard? If not, consider another breed. His fabulous coat requires quite a bit of brushing, combing, and fussing to keep it looking good. A thorough brushing every day is recommended, plus a bath every six to eight weeks. Like all dogs with fluffy coats, the Briard can get dirty easily, so you"re in for muddy paws, leaves or burrs tracked into the house, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet and dirty beard. If the idea of keeping up with the Briard coat is overwhelming, consider hiring a professional groomer to help. You won"t get out of regular brushings between groomings, but bathing and drying the coat is much easier in a salon equipped with waist-high tubs and high velocity dryers. It"s especially easy when you"re paying someone else to do it! Brush your Briard"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The Briard usually has rear dewclaws so don"t forget to trim these, too. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Briard to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A loving and playful companion, the Briard makes an excellent family dog. He is protective of the children in his family, and has been known to "defend" them when parents discipline. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. If the Briard is raised with other dogs and pets, and learns they are members of his pack, he gets along fairly well. However, his prey drive is strong, so training is necessary for him to learn not to chase the family cat or quarrel with your Beagle. Supervision is a good idea, as animals outside his immediate family are likely to trigger his instinct to give chase. Keep him on a leash when you are in public.
Briards are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Briards in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Briard rescue.

The Brittany is a happy, elegant gundog who is alternately described as hyperactive and as the perfect family friend. The truth depends on your own interests and activity levels. Like all sporting breeds, the Brittany has energy to spare — he is certainly an Energizer Bunny of a dog — and that combined with his other qualities can make him a good fit for the right home. Brittanys are remarkable in many ways. Their medium size — 30 to 40 pounds and 17 to 20 inches tall — is attractive to families and sportsmen alike. They"re not too big to stay in the house or travel with you in your car if you have a passion for hunting. And they"re versatile. Brittanys have won more dual championships than any other breed. A dual championship means that the dog has won championships in both field trials and conformation shows. However, the Brittany isn"t for everyone. For one thing, his energy level might be more than many people bargain for. Brittanys have an irrepressible joy of life and a high level of enthusiasm for everything they do, whether that"s playing with the kids, seeking out birds, or simply enjoying life with a good, stretched-out, no-holds-barred run. If you don"t have the same energy and enthusiasm, it can be difficult to keep up with a Brittany. Because of his extraordinary energy, it"s important to provide him with plenty of exercise. A walk around the block isn"t enough. If his basic need for exercise and a job to do isn"t met, he may become neurotic and hyperactive, expending his energy in ways that you probably won"t like. All dogs like to have "work" to do, but Brittanys are especially task-oriented. You can"t leave your Brittany home alone all day while you go to work and then expect him to be mellow and want to lie at your feet when you come home. Not going to happen with this dog! He will have a day"s worth of energy and affection pent up, and he"ll be bursting at the seams to expend both. Brittanys require an hour or more of exuberant exercise every day, which makes them unsuitable for most apartment dwellers. If you"re looking for a Brittany puppy, you may hear breeders differentiating between "American" Brittanys and "French" Brittanys. Both are the same breed, but the American Brittany is taller and faster than the French Brittany, which is smaller and generally works more closely to the hunter. Brittanys are known for being sensitive to harsh treatment. A stern look or a sharp word is often sufficient punishment when your Brittany is acting up. Train them firmly but gently, using positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Because of their happy, friendly nature, Brittanys are good with children and other pets. Their exuberance, however, make cause them to accidentally injure a small child, so be sure to supervise your Brittany when it is playing with your children. If you purchase your Brittany to use for hunting, you"ll find that he works much like a pointer, with a smaller range. Brittanys point on game and willingly retrieve both on land and in the water. Brittanys have a natural instinct for hunting, which makes them a good choice for people who are new to the sport of hunting. If hunting is not the sport for you, consider participating in agility, flyball, or other such activities with your Brittany. Your dog will love it, and so will you! If you can keep up with the Brittany"s exercise needs and need for a job, you"ll find that he"s a great family companion. Brittanys are good-looking dogs who attract compliments. Their grooming needs are relatively simple. They"re always happy, friendly, and affectionate. They could well be the perfect dog for families who play hard, love the outdoors, and want a dog to share it with them.
Brittanys are high-energy dogs. They need at least an hour of intensive exercise each day. Without sufficient exercise, your Brittany may become neurotic and destructive. Brittanys are smart and need mental stimulation as well as physical exercise. Training for dog sports is a great way to provide this. Brittanys don"t respond well to harsh treatment. Be gentle and consistent but firm — don"t let them run the household. Brittanys are people-oriented and don"t like to be left alone for long periods of time without something to keep them busy. If you work outside the home, you should consider getting two Brittanys to keep each other company. Although they are friendly and like children, it"s not recommended that you let your small children play with your Brittany without supervision. Your Brittany has so much energy and enthusiasm, he may accidentally injure your child. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Brittany takes his name from the Celtic area of northwest France that was once an independent kingdom. Brittany lies just across the English Channel from Wales, and for well over a thousand years there was a great deal of commerce between the two countries, with dogs surely being a part of that trade. It"s easy to see by their coloring alone as well as other physical characteristics that the Brittany and the Welsh Springer Spaniel probably had common ancestors. The first records of Brittany-type dogs are visual: paintings and tapestries dating to the 17th century. They show a liver and white dog pointing partridge. Modern Brittanys started to take shape in the mid-1800s in Pontou, a small town in Brittany. It"s said that they were the result of a cross between a white and mahogany female owned by a French hunter and a lemon and white male brought to Brittany for shooting by an English sportsman. Of the two pups they produced, one was considered to have the requisite hunting ability and became a popular stud in the area. The result was bob-tailed dogs that pointed and retrieved. Apparently, local poachers were quite fond of them for their speed, agility, and willingness to take direction. Around the same time, dog shows became popular in Britain and other parts of Europe, including, naturellement, la France. Brittanys moved effortlessly from the field to the show ring and were recognized as a breed in France in 1907. The first French Brittany registered in that country was an orange and white dog named Boy. Brittanys didn"t make it to the United States until 1931, but once they became known, they gained steadily in popularity. The first Brittany registered with the American Kennel Club was Edir du Mesnil, in 1934. The American Brittany Club was formed in 1942 and rewrote the French standard to suit themselves. Like so many breeds, Brittanys suffered a decline as a result of World War II. In France, breeding of Brittanys came to a halt during that time. After the war, French breeders decided to allow black spotted dogs in the standard because the gene pool was so depleted throughout Europe. U.S. breeders did not follow suit. Even today, black is not an accepted color for Brittanys in the U.S. and Canada, but it is accepted in all other countries. For many years, many breeders wanted to delete the word "spaniel" from the name of the breed because Brittanys are pointing dogs, not flushing dogs like spaniels. In April 1982, the AKC Board of Directors approved changing the name to Brittany, deleting the word "spaniel" as a part of the name. In some other countries, however, they still are called Brittany Spaniels. Today, the Brittany ranks 31st among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Brittanys are 17 1/2 to 20 1/2 inches tall and weigh 30 to 40 pounds.
Brittanys are happy and alert. As befits a pointing breed, they are curious and independent, but respond well to their people and want to please them. They can be singleminded when it comes to birds, but when they"re not focused on their feathered prey, they enjoy spending time with their people, especially if they"re doing something active. Brittanys are not just energetic, they"re smart, so they needs loads of exercise and mental stimulation each day. When it comes to training, be consistent but never harsh. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Brittanys need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Brittany puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Brittanys are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Brittanys will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Brittanys, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. In mild cases, with proper diet and exercise the animal can lead a full and active life. In more severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Your veterinarian can x-ray your dog"s hips for evaluation. Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. While epilepsy can"t be cured, it often can be controlled with medication. If your Brittany has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Hypothyroidism: This condition is caused by an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.
Brittanys are active, indoors and out. They do best if they have a large yard or, better yet, some acreage where they can run off some of their excess energy. They"re not best suited to apartment life or city living unless you truly have the time and dedication to provide them with the amount and type of exercise they need. This breed is resistant to cold and damp conditions when hunting, but should live indoors with the people they love. Like any dog, they should be confined to a safely fenced yard when they aren"t being supervised. Limit exercise to no more than half an hour at a time in puppies younger than two years of age. Their joints aren"t yet fully formed, and neither is their muscle coordination and ability to focus. Take a break from training, play, or other activity any time your Brittany pup seems tired or unenthusiastic. Brittanys love to run in wide-open spaces. It"s essential to teach them to come when called. Train them with firmness and consistency, but never be harsh. Often, a sharp word is more than enough to stop any misbehavior. Like any dog, Brittanys can be destructive as puppies. They can also be destructive as adults if their needs for mental and physical challenges aren"t met. Keep them occupied with exercise and training, and crate puppies to prevent them from getting into trouble if you"re not around to supervise.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Brittany in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Brittany, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Brittanys aren"t heavily coated dogs. They have dense, flat, or wavy hair that"s never curly, wiry, or silky. You"ll see a little feathering on the ears and legs, but not so much that the Brittany would have trouble making his way through dense brush and undergrowth. You might notice that your Brittany"s skin is fairly loose. Loose skin sort of rolls when it comes in contact with burrs and thorns, protecting the dog from puncture wounds. Most commonly, Brittanys are orange and white or liver and white. Sometimes their coats have a roan pattern, which is a fine mixture of colored and white hairs; for instance, orange roan. Some ticking — small isolated areas of black hairs on a white background — is desirable. Occasionally you"ll see a tri-color Brittany, a liver and white dog with orange markings on the eyebrows, muzzle, cheeks, inside the ears, beneath the tail, and orange freckles on the lower part of the legs. Brittanys are easy to groom. Keep their coats in good condition with weekly brushing, and a bath or dry shampoo when necessary. They don"t shed a great deal. Check the ears weekly for signs of infection such as redness or tenderness, as well as for foreign objects, especially if your Brittany has been out in rough or brushy terrain. Brush your Brittany"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Brittany enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Brittany to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Brittanys are a good choice for a family with active children, but their energy level might be overwhelming for toddlers. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Brittanys enjoy the company of other dogs and can also get along fine with cats, especially if they"re introduced at an early age.
Brittanys are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Brittanys in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Brittany rescue.

"Monkey face" is a term often used to describe the appealing Brussels Griffon. This small, sturdy dog has an intelligent and lively look that"s almost human in expression. Brussels Griffons, often called Griffons for short, originated in Belgium, where their hunting skills were used to keep stables free of rats and mice. They eventually became more popular as house pets, and these cheerful, curious, and affectionate dogs do make great companions — for the right person. They"re sensitive, sometimes moody and high-strung, and more than a little demanding of their owner"s attention. In the U.S., there are two types of Brussels Griffons: The rough-coated Griffon and the smooth-coated Griffon, called the Petit Brabancon. In the breed"s homeland of Belgium, there are three types: the Petit Brabancon (which is smooth-coated, as in the U.S.), the Brussels Griffon, which has a rough red coat, and the Belgian Griffon, which has a rough coat that can be any color other than red. The Griffons" flat face, prominent chin, and large, wide-set eyes have led to many comparisons to the Ewoks or Wookie creatures in Star Wars. Despite their small size and cuddly looks, these sturdy dogs are suprisingly heavy and athletic. Many Griffons compete in agility, obedience, and other performance sports. Griffons usually get along well with other dogs and pets, but can be irritable with rowdy children. They"re very affectionate and tend to bond most closely with one person in the family. They especially love to snuggle with their favorite person. Because they"re small and active in the house, they make good apartment dogs, although you may have to train them not to bark at every noise they hear. This unique breed isn"t for everyone. The Griffon needs an owner who appreciates a dog that"s up-close and personal rather than independent. Empty nesters are often ideal, because Griffons are like children who never grow up and leave for college. Of course, this trait doesn"t appeal to everyone. Griffons require a time commitment, not only because they want a lot of time and attention from their people, but also because they can live to be 14 or 15 years old.
Some Brussels Griffons can be gluttonous, and others are picky eaters. It"s best to measure out their food and give them regular meals, instead of leaving out food for them all the time. Griffons can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain — stay patient, consistent, and definitely use a crate. They"ll bark enthusiastically at every sound, making them good watchdogs but sometimes noisy housemates. Teaching your dog the "quiet" command is recommended. Griffons are sensitive dogs and when treated roughly, they may become fear biters — dogs who bite out of fear, rather than aggression. Griffons can snap and growl at rambunctious kids who handle them roughly or give them unwanted hugs and kisses, so they"re not a good match for homes with young children. Some Griffons aren"t fond of children of any age. It"s difficult to breed Griffons. They often need Caesarean sections, the litters are typically small, and puppy mortality is high. Griffons are not backyard dogs. Like other dogs with short noses, they"re vulnerable to heat stroke, and their short hair makes them vulnerable to the cold as well. They need to live inside with the family. The demand for Griffon puppies surged after a Griffon dog was featured in the movie As Good As It Gets. With the increased market for puppies came careless breeding. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments. Griffons can be either shy or aggressive, especially if they come from low-quality breeders who don"t test the parent dogs for temperament problems.
Brussels Griffons trace their roots back to Belgium, where small, terrier-like dogs were bred to hunt and kill vermin in stables, especially those of horse-drawn hansom cabs--the equivalent of today"s taxi — in the cities. The Brussels Griffon as we know it today was created from several breeds, including the Affenpinscher, Pug, and English Toy Spaniel. The Affenpinscher contributed the size and wiry coat texture, while the Toy Spaniel influence is seen in the large, expressive eyes, rounded head, and upturned underjaw. In the smooth-coated variety of the Brussels Griffon, the Pug influence is seen. These crosses eventually created a small dog with great rat-hunting abilities and an almost human-looking face — the Brussels Griffon or, as they are called in Europe, the Griffon Bruxellois. Over time, these cocky little dogs became popular as house pets for both noblemen and workers. By 1883, Belgian breeders created a standard for the breed — a written description of how the breed should look--and started entering them in dog shows. Marie Henriette, Belgium"s queen and a dog enthusiast, fell in love with the little Griffon Bruxellois and began breeding them and promoting them in Europe and abroad. In 1889, the Club du Griffon Bruxellois was formed in Brussels with the smooth-coated variety being called the Griffon Brabancon. Both rough-coated and smooth-coated Brussels Griffon were exported to England in the early 1890s. In 1898, the breed was admitted to the English Stud Book, and clubs formed to develop the breed. The Griffon found his way to the U.S. around the same time. In 1899, the first Brussels Griffons were registered with the American Kennel Club and were shown at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1900. The numbers of Griffons shrank during World Wars I and II, when breeding dogs — or even keeping a small dog as a pet — was a luxury that few could afford. By the end of World War II, Brussels Griffons were nearly extinct in their country of origin, Belgium, but they hung on in England, thanks to the efforts of English breeders. Brussels Griffons have remained a fairly rare breed, although they became trendy for a time in the late 1950s, and again in the late 1990s, after a Griffon upstaged Jack Nicholson in the movie As Good As It Gets.
Griffons typically stand 7 to 8 inches tall and weigh 7 to 12 pounds. Occasionally, a Griffon will grow to be 20 pounds, a throwback to the breed"s larger ancestors.
Dogs are individuals, and in this breed temperaments range from outgoing and active to reserved, verging on shy. Most fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. The Brussels Griffon has a bossy streak and will run the household whenever he"s allowed to, but beneath that tough-dog exterior he"s a softie who loves being with his people and is in constant need of their time and attention. They"re often called "Velcro dogs" because they like to stick close to your side. A Brussels Griffon who feels ignored will resort to misbehavior to get your attention. He dislikes being left home alone and will find a way to let you know of his displeasure. Temperament doesn"t happen in a vacuum. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Brussels Griffons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. Brussels Griffons love their people, but they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Brussels Griffon who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.
Griffons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Griffons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Griffons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Veterinary care includes giving your Griffon supplements and medicines to help prevent or lessen the pain of arthritis and, in severe cases, surgery. Patella Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Eye Problems: The Brussels Griffon"s prominent eyes are prone to being scratched and becoming irritated. Be sure to check with your vet if your dog"s eyes are red or he is rubbing them excessively. Skin Allergies: Brussels Griffons can be prone to allergies. If yours is itching or licking at his paws excessively, have him checked by your vet.
Without a doubt, Griffons are housedogs. But so long as they"re inside with the family, their small size makes them suited to any household, from city highrises to country estates. In either place they can impress you with their inborn rat-hunting skill. They have a lot of energy and need regular exercise to stay in shape, but they"ll do okay without a yard so long as they get walks or some other exercise every day. Because they"re short-nosed dogs, they can"t cool the air they breathe in, and can overheat on hot, humid days. Heat stroke is dangerous, so keep your Griffon someplace cool on a hot day. If you do take him out in the sun, watch for the signs of heat exhaustion — deep, rapid panting and sluggishness. More serious signs include vomiting or diarrhea and seizures. Don"t let him play hard on a hot day, and be sure he has access to plenty of fresh, cool water. His intelligence and athletic ability make the Griffon a contender in dog sports such as agility, obedience, and even tracking, as long as you persuade him that it"s worthwhile. Training must be fun, and positive reinforcement — rewarding your dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for mistakes — is the only way to get cooperation from a Griffon. You can"t force a Griffon to do anything, but you can make him believe it"s his idea. Like so many small breeds, Brussels Griffons can be hard to housetrain. Use crate training and be consistent and persistent, and your dog may eventually be reliable in the house. Or not.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Griffon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Griffon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Rough-coated Brussels Griffons have a wiry, dense coat with no silky hair anywhere on their bodies. The hair on the head is slightly longer around the eyes, cheeks, and chin. Although it"s wiry, the rough coat should never appear untidy. Smooth-coated Brussels Griffons have a straight, short, glossy coat that lies close to the body, with no trace of wiry hair. Brussels Griffons come in four colors: Red (a reddish brown color with perhaps a little black at the whiskers and chin) Belge (black and reddish brown mixed, usually with black mask and whiskers) Black and Tan (black with uniform reddish brown markings under the chin, on the legs, above each eye, around the edges of the ears, and around the vent — the rear end to you and me) Black A mature Brussels Griffon may sport a gray muzzle, but otherwise you won"t see any white hairs on him. To keep their coats looking neat, rough-coated Griffons must be brushed weekly with a natural bristle brush or hound glove to remove dead hair and then combed with a medium-tooth metal comb. Twice a year they need specialized grooming. The coat must t be "hand stripped," which involves gently plucking loose hairs out by hand to allow new coat growth. Your BG"s breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it — not all do. The benefits? Stripping maintains the coat"s hard, wiry texture and reduces scratching and shedding. And this type of coat is somewhat more friendly to people with allergies. You can keep your BG in a schnauzer clip if you don"t want to deal with the time or expense involved in stripping the coat, but if you have allergies it may be worth your while to have it done or learn to do it yourself. Clipping the coat makes it feel softer, and the dog will shed more than he does with his wiry coat. Smooth-coated Griffons, on the other hand, need very little grooming other than weekly brushing and an occasional bath when they start to smell doggy. If your Griffon likes to play outdoors and then nap on your sofa or bed, you may want to bathe him weekly. As long as you use a shampoo made for dogs and rinse thoroughly, this shouldn"t dry out his skin or hair. Whether smooth-coated or rough, the Griffon sheds little hair. Brush your Griffon"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Griffon enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Griffon to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Griffons don"t enjoy hitting, unwanted hugs, being chased, or being forced to sit in someone"s lap. If they"re cornered or can"t escape someone"s grasp, they"ll growl or snap. For these reasons, they"re not a good match for homes with young children, who often don"t understand that a cute little Griffon might not want their "love and kisses." It"s fine to let your Griffon be around young kids — in fact, it"s important to get him used to children, especially during puppyhood, when his temperament is still taking shape. But always supervise your Griffon when children are around, and never let young kids pick him up; instead, make the child sit on the floor with the dog in his lap. Pay attention to the dog"s body language, and put him safely in his crate if he looks unhappy or uncomfortable with the child"s attention. Griffons usually get along well with other pets, but like most small breeds they"re completely unaware of their size and will take on dogs much bigger than themselves. Be prepared to protect them from themselves.
Brussels Griffons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Griffons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Griffon rescue. National Brussels Griffon Rescue, Inc.

If you remember the late 1980s, you probably recall the Budweiser commercials featuring a Bull Terrier named Spuds Mackenzie, whose sly grin and on-screen antics turned the breed into a pop icon. Many people were captivated by the breed"s unique head, muscular build, and fun-loving nature. After the ads aired, the Bull Terrier"s popularity soared.Nicknamed "the kid in a dog suit," the Bull Terrier is active and friendly, as well as being one of the clowns of the dog world. He has a larger-than-life personality that ranges from intelligent and innovative — not always the most desirable qualities in a dog — to placid and loyal. He also comes in a smaller version — the Miniature Bull Terrier — who shares the same attributes.Life with a Bull Terrier is always an experience. He"s a "busy" dog from puppyhood well into middle age. The Bull Terrier isn"t content to spend long periods alone day after day; he wants to be with his people, doing what they"re doing. He does best with an active family who can provide him with plenty of energetic play. He also needs someone who will consistently (but kindly) enforce the house rules. Otherwise, he"ll make up rules of his own. For that reason, he"s not the best choice for timid owners or people who are new to dogs.Like most terriers, Bull Terriers (unneutered males in particular) can be aggressive toward other animals, especially other dogs. To be well-behaved around other canines, they need early socialization: positive, supervised exposure to other dogs that begins in early puppyhood and continues throughout life. Cats and other furry animals who enter their territory should beware.Because they can be rambunctious, Bull Terriers aren"t recommended for homes with younger children, but with older kids they"re tireless playmates. They enjoy vigorous daily exercise and can be highly destructive if they"re bored. Successfully training a Bull Terrier calls for patience, confident leadership, and consistency.Some cities and states have restrictions on or ban ownership of Bull Terriers, and you should be aware of your local laws before you bring your Bull Terrier home.If you"re ready to take on the challenge of a Bull Terrier, you"ll find him to be an affectionate, loyal companion who"s always ready to entertain you — he"s been known to make even the most serious of people giggle — or go on an adventure. One thing"s for sure: life with this breed will never be dull.
Bull Terriers thrive in the company of their people, and should live indoors with their human family. They don"t do well when left alone for long periods and will wreak destruction when bored. Bull Terriers aren"t suited for cold, damp climates. Keep your Bull Terrier warm with a coat or sweater in winter. These aren"t high maintenance dogs, grooming-wise. A weekly brushing and occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth is usually all it takes to keeps them clean, although they must be brushed more frequently during twice-yearly shedding periods. The Bull Terrier needs 30 to 60 minutes of exercise, play, and mental stimulation daily. Ownership of Bull Terriers is restricted or banned in some cities, states, and provinces. Research your local dog laws before you get one; banned dogs may be seized and euthanized. The Bull Terrier is strong-willed and can be difficult to train. He"s not recommended for timid or first-time dog owners. Without early socialization and training, Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs, animals, and people he doesn"t know. Bull Terriers are too rough and rambunctious for homes with young children, but they"re tireless playmates for active older kids who"ve been taught how to interact with dogs. Never buy a Bull Terrier from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Bull Terrier dates to approximately 1835 and was probably created by crossing a Bulldog with the now-extinct white English Terrier. These "bull and terrier" dogs were later crossed with Spanish Pointers to increase their size. They were known as gladiators for their prowess in the dog-fighting ring.In 1860, fanciers of the bull and terrier, in particular a man named James Hinks, set about creating an all-white dog. The striking animals became fashionable companions for gentlemen and were nicknamed "White Cavalier" because of their courage in the dog-fighting ring and their courtliness toward people. While they"re no longer used for fighting, white Bull Terriers still go by that sobriquet to this day, a tribute to their sweet disposition (which of course is shared by colored Bull Terriers).The first Bull Terrier registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) was Nellie II in 1885. Twelve years later, in 1897, the Bull Terrier Club of America was formed. The colored Bull Terrier was made a separate variety in 1936, and the Miniature Bull Terrier became a separate breed in 1992.Well-known fans of Bull Terriers include General George S. Patton, whose white Bull Terrier Willie followed him everywhere; actress Dolores Del Rio; author John Steinbeck; and President Woodrow Wilson. One well-known Bull Terrier is Patsy Ann, who greeted each ship that docked in Juneau, Alaska during the 1930s. Beloved by tourists, she was photographed more often than Rin Tin Tin, and in 1934 she was named the official greeter of Juneau. Today, Patsy Ann"s spirit lives on in a bronze statue that was commissioned and placed on the Juneau wharf in 1992.A Bull Terrier appeared in Sheila Burnford"s book "The Incredible Journey," as well as the first film version of it, but that film didn"t have the same effect on the breed as Budweiser"s 1980-era commercials starring Bull Terrier Spuds Mackenzie. When the ad campaign aired, the breed"s popularity soared.A colored Bull Terrier made history in 2006, when Ch. Rocky Top"s Sundance Kid (Rufus to his friends) became the first colored Bull Terrier to win Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. The only white Bull Terrier to win the prestigious event was Ch. Haymarket Faultless in 1918. The breed"s appearance has changed quite a bit — for the better, breeders say — since then.Today, Bull Terriers rank 61st in popularity among the breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club, up from 85th in 1996. Miniature Bull Terriers rank 129th.
Bull Terriers come in a wide range of sizes, ranging from 35 pounds to 75 pounds. Generally, males weigh 55 to 65 pounds and females 45 to 55 pounds. They stand about 21 to 22 inches at the shoulder.The Miniature Bull Terrier stands 10 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 25 to 33 pounds.
Never one to take a backseat to anyone or anything, the Bull Terrier is a friendly, feisty extrovert who"s always ready for a good time, and always happy to see you. A Bull Terrier who"s shy and backs away from people is absolutely not normal.Bull Terriers and Mini Bull Terriers are described as courageous and full of fire. These are good traits, but they can veer into the disagreeable category if the Bull Terrier is allowed to become possessive or jealous. Without early training and socialization — exposure to dogs and other animals — they can be potentially aggressive toward other animals.With people, though, they have a sweet disposition. On the downside, they can be chewers, barkers, and tail chasers, and are often difficult to housetrain.
Bull terriers are generally healthy, but like any breed, they can have health issues. Reputable breeders provide health certifications for a puppy"s parents.In Bull Terriers, you should expect to see the results of BAER hearing tests for white Bull Terriers, health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for the heart and thyroid, and UP:UC ratios for kidney function.Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.The following problems may occur in the breed: Hereditary Nephritis is a severe form of kidney disease found in Bull Terriers, often at an early age. It"s caused by small and undeveloped kidneys or a malfunction of the kidney"s filters, resulting in high levels of protein in the urine. Bull Terriers with this disease usually die before they"re three years old, although some live to be 6 or 8 years old before succumbing to kidney failure. A urine protein/urine creatinine (UP:UC) test is recommended annually, starting when dogs are 18 months old. Bull Terriers with an abnormal UP:UC ratio, meaning there"s too much protein in the urine, should not be bred. Bull Terriers can also suffer from renal dysplasia, a congenital disease (meaning the dog is born with it) in which the kidneys don"t mature properly, hindering their ability to perform properly. Deafness in one or both ears is common in white dogs, and some colored Bull Terriers can be deaf in one ear. All Bull Terrier puppies should undergo BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) testing to ensure that their hearing is normal. A veterinarian or a Bull Terrier club can help you find the nearest BAER testing facility. Bull Terriers who are deaf in one ear can lead relatively normal lives, but puppies that are deaf in both ears require special training techniques and handling. Heart Disease caused by defects in heart structure and function is occasionally found in Bull Terriers. Some cases are more serious than others and usually are indicated by the presence of a heart murmur. In some cases, a cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram) may be necessary to diagnose the problem. Some Bull Terriers outgrow their murmurs, some live with them for years with no problem, and others develop heart failure. Depending on the condition and the stage at which it"s diagnosed, treatment may range from medication to surgery. Skin Problems can affect Bull Terriers, especially white ones, who have sensitive skin that can be prone to rashes, sores and irritations. They may also be prone to contact or inhalant allergies, caused by a reaction to substances such as detergents or other chemicals or airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Check your Bull Terrier"s skin regularly and treat any rashes quickly. Provide soft, clean bedding in crates and other sleeping areas to prevent sores. Sometimes a change to a diet with few or no chemical additives can help. Other Bull Terriers need long-term treatment with antibiotics or steroids to keep skin problems under control. Spinning is an obsessive form of tail-chasing that usually begins at approximately six months of age. It can continue for hours and leave the dog with no interest in food or water. Spinning may be a type of seizure and is sometimes successfully treated with medications such as phenobarbitol, anafranil or Prozac. Treatment is often more successful in females than males. Bull Terriers can also develop a milder form of tail chasing that"s easily dealt with by eliminating the dog"s boredom. Lens luxation is when the lens of the eye is displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It"s sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.
The Bull Terrier needs someone at home during the day. Leaving a Bull Terrier to entertain himself is about as smart as leaving a creative and intelligent child unsupervised in a room full of explosives. For one thing, they"ll eat just about anything, and many die from gastrointestinal blockages that aren"t discovered until it"s too late. Rawhide toys can be especially problematic. Bull Terrier-proof your home!A Bull Terrier needs half an hour to an hour of physical and mental exercise daily. He"ll enjoy going for walks, chasing a ball, or testing his wits against an interactive toy. He"s also capable of competing in agility and obedience trials. Be sure to always walk him on leash so he won"t run after other animals or go off exploring on his own.Bull Terrier puppies are bouncy and into everything. High-impact exercise can damage growing bones, so until your puppy"s full grown, at 12 to 18 months of age, beware of bone-jarring activities such as jumping on and off the furniture, playing Frisbee, or running on slick wood or tile floors. These can all stress or injure the still-developing joints and ligaments.Early and consistent training is essential. You must be able to provide leadership without resorting to physical force or harsh words. A Bull Terrier isn"t the easiest breed to train, and you"ll be most successful if you appeal to his love of play with positive reinforcement techniques while still remaining firm and consistent in what you expect.Bull Terriers can be difficult to housetrain. Follow the housetraining program closely; the crate method is best. A crate will also prevent your Bull Terrier from destroying your belongings or otherwise getting into trouble.Bull Terriers are suspicious of strangers and can be aggressive toward other animals (especially dogs of the same sex) and people. Take him to puppy socialization classes as early as possible, as well as to dog-friendly public places so he can get used to many different situations, people, and dogs. He should also learn to welcome visitors to your home.
Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 4 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Bull Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Bull Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bull Terrier"s coat is short, flat, and shiny, with a hard texture. Bull Terriers come in two color varieties: white and colored. White Bull Terriers are solid white, with or without colored markings on the head but nowhere else on the body. Colored Bull Terriers are any color other than white or any color with white markings.Bull Terriers are easy to groom; they need only weekly brushing with a rubber mitt or curry brush. The exception is during their twice yearly shedding season, when daily brushing will be necessary to keep all the hair under control. Unless they"ve rolled in something stinky, Bull Terriers don"t need frequent bathing and can be washed with a dry shampoo or dusted off with a damp cloth.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bull Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don"t get caught in the carpet and tear. If the feet need to be tidied up with trimming, the best time to do it is when you are clipping the nails.Check the ears weekly to make sure there"s no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean them as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog"s breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don"t stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger.Begin getting your Bull Terrier used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Bull Terriers and Miniature Bull Terriers are active dogs who can play rough, so they"re not recommended for homes with young children. They"re great playmates with boundless energy for active older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Bull Terriers can, however, be aggressive toward kids they don"t know, especially if there"s a lot of shouting or wrestling going on. They may feel it"s their duty to protect "their" children from their friends. Always supervise play; as with any dog, never leave a dog alone with a child, and teach children how to approach and touch dogs.With the children in their own family, they"re highly tolerant, but they don"t like being teased. Don"t permit your children to play tug-of-war with the dog.Bull Terriers, especially unneutered males, can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex, but opposite genders usually get along well. Bull Terriers shouldn"t be trusted with cats or other small furry animals.
Bull Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting a Bull Terrier, a rescue group is a good place to start.

What do England, the U.S. Marines, Yale University, University of Georgia, and dozens of other schools all have in common? The dog they have all chosen to represent their tough, tenacious characters. That dog? Why, it"s the Bulldog, of course! Sometimes called the English Bulldog or the British Bulldog, the breed originated in England and has a bloody past. It descended from fighting mastiffs that were brought to the British Isles by the Romans and was used in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, however, the Bulldog only slightly resembles his ancestors in appearance. And all of the ferociousness that he exhibited in the bullbaiting pens? Gone for good. Despite his still ferocious appearance, you"d be hard-pressed to find a dog with a sweeter, more loving disposition. Bulldogs are never mistaken for other breeds of dogs. They are a medium-size dog with a thick-set, low-slung body. Their short-muzzled head is massive and square. They have broad shoulders and chests, with thick, sturdy limbs. Although Bulldogs are low to the ground, they are wide and muscular. Their broad heads have cheeks that extend to the sides of their eyes, and the skin on their foreheads should have dense wrinkles. A Bulldog has a droopy upper lip and his lower jaw is undershot, meaning that his lower teeth stick out farther than his top teeth. The Bulldog"s jaws are massive and strong, intended for latching on to his opponent and holding on. Bulldogs have round, dark eyes. Their ears are small and thin, folded back like a rose. Their short tails are carried low on their rumps. The Bulldog"s muscular body leads him to have a distinctive gait. Because his stocky legs are set at each corner of his body, he moves with more of a waddle than a walk. It resembles sort of a loose-jointed, shuffling, sideways roll. Because their shoulders are much wider than their rear ends and they have such large heads, it"s difficult for the females to whelp puppies without assistance. Most have to have caesarean sections to deliver their puppies, so breeding a Bulldog is an expensive proposition. Despite cartoon depictions of them as ferocious dogs, today"s Bulldogs are bred to be affectionate and kind. They are, indeed, resolute and courageous, but they aren"t out to pick a fight. They often have a calm dignity about them when they are mature, and while they are friendly and playful, they can be a bit stubborn and protective of their families. Bulldogs love people. They seek people out for attention and enjoy nothing more than languishing next to their masters, and perhaps snoring while sleeping with their heads in their laps. Unfortunately, the Bulldog"s unique body and head structure makes him prone to health problems, especially respiratory and joint difficulties. They can quickly become overweight if they don"t get enough exercise. Too much weight stresses their bodies and may aggravate existing health problems. The Bulldog is popular dog in the U.S., but he"s not for everyone. He"s surprisingly heavy for his size, and if you need to pick him up, say to take him to the vet, it can be a challenge. Inside the house, Bulldogs tend to be inactive, preferring to sleep until it"s time to eat again. They love children, but don"t expect them to spend hours chasing a ball or running with the kids in the backyard. Your Bulldog may engage in such play for a while, but then you"ll find him back at your side, content to watch the world go by and look up at you happily with that face that only a mother - or a devoted Bulldog fan - could love.
Bulldogs can be stubborn and lazy. Your mature Bulldog may not be very enthusiastic about going to a walk, but it"s important that he is exercised every day to keep him fit. Bulldogs can"t tolerate heat and humidity. When your Bulldog is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately if he starts to show distress. Some people put kiddy play pools filled with water in a shaded spot for their Bulldogs to lie in when the weather is warm and everyone is outside. They definitely are housedogs and should not live outdoors all of the time. Bulldogs are sensitive to cold weather. Bulldogs wheeze, snort, and snore. They also are prone to sleep apnea. Bulldogs are well-known for having flatulence. If this problem seems excessive with yours, talk to your vet. Bulldogs" short noses make them prone to a number of respiratory ailments. Bulldogs can have pinched nostrils that make it difficult for them to breathe and may require surgery to correct. Bulldogs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if you don"t monitor their food intake. Because of the size of their heads and fronts, Bulldogs have difficulty giving birth. Most require caesareans to deliver their puppies. It isn"t advised for inexperienced breeders to try to breed them. As a short-nosed breed, Bulldogs are sensitive to anesthesia. Be sure to talk with your vet about this before any surgeries are done. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
The Bulldog is a much different dog today than his ancestors. Descended from ancient mastiff-type dogs, the Bulldog breed was developed entirely in England. The first mention of the breed was in 1500, a description of a man "with two Bolddogges at his tayle..." The then-fierce dogs were used in a practice called bull baiting, which involved the dog grabbing onto the bull"s nose and roughly shaking it. Bull baiting actually had a purpose; it was thought to tenderize the bull"s meat. For many years, this practice was said to "thin" the blood of the bull and make its flesh tender after it was butchered. This belief was so strong that many areas in England had laws requiring bulls to be baited before they were slaughtered. More than that, it was a popular spectator sport in a time when there were no professional sports, TV shows, movies, or video games. The angry bull would toss the dog up in the air with its horns if it could, much to the delight of the watching crowd. The dog, on the other hand, would attempt to latch onto the bull, usually at its snout, and pin it to the ground through the force of its painful bite. Upcoming bullbaitings were advertised and crowds wagered on the outcome of the struggle. These early Bulldogs were taller and heavier than today"s Bulldog, and they were bred to be especially adept at this bloody sport. Typically, they crept on their bellies toward the enraged bull so he couldn"t get his horns under their bodies and toss them up in the air. And their wide mouths and powerful jaws were impossible for the bull to shake off once the Bulldog had a firm hold on its snout. His short, flat nose enabled the Bulldog to breathe while holding onto the bull"s snout. He needed to be tenacious to hang onto the bull no matter how much the bull tried to shake him off. The Bulldog"s high tolerance for pain was developed to enhance his ability to excel at this barbarous spot. Even the wrinkles on his head are said to have had a purpose: to direct the blood that resulted from his grip on the bull to flow away from his eyes so he wouldn"t be blinded. In 1835, after many years of controversy, bullbaiting was outlawed in England, and many thought the Bulldog would disappear since he no longer had a purpose. At the time, the Bulldog wasn"t an affectionate companion. The most aggressive and courageous dogs had been selectively bred for generations to be bull-baiters. They lived to fight with bulls, bears and anything else that was put before them. It was all they knew. Despite this, many people admired the Bulldog"s stamina, strength, and persistence. These few decided to save the appearance and breed them to have a sweet, gentle temperament instead of the aggression needed for the baiting arena. And so the Bulldog was re-engineered. Dedicated, patient breeders started selecting only those dogs that had a docile temperament for breeding. Aggressive and neurotic dogs weren"t allowed to reproduce. By focusing their attention upon the temperament of the Bulldog, these breeders transformed the Bulldog into the gentle, affectionate dog we see today. Breeders started showing Bulldogs in conformation shows in England in 1859. The first dog show that allowed Bulldogs to be shown was at Birmingham, England in 1860. In 1861, a Bulldog named King Dick won at the Birmingham show. One of his descendants, a dog named Crib, was later described as being "close to perfection." In 1864, the first Bulldog breed club was formed by a man named R.S. Rockstro. The club had about 30 members and its motto was "Hold Fast." A member of the club, Samuel Wickens, wrote the first breed standard, using the pseudonym Philo-Kuon. The Bulldog"s breed standard reportedly was the first one written in the world. The club unfortunately disbanded after only three years. In 1875, another Bulldog club was founded, and it developed a breed standard that was similar to the Philo-Kuon. This breed club is still in existence. Bulldogs were brought to the United States, and a brindle and white Bulldog named Donald was shown in New York in 1880. A Bulldog named Bob was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1886. In 1890, H.D. Kendall of Lowell, Massachusetts founded The Bulldog Club of America. It was one of the first breed clubs to become a member of the new American Kennel Club. In the beginning, the club used the British breed standard, but thought it wasn"t concise enough, so they developed the American standard in 1894 for what they called the American-bred Bulldog. The English protested about the name and also some of the items in the new standard. After a lot of work, the standard was revised and accepted in 1896. This standard is still used today. The American Kennel Club recognized the Bulldog in 1890. During the 1940s and 1950s, Bulldogs were close to the top 10 breeds in popularity. Today, the Bulldog ranks 12th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC, a tribute to his solid credentials as a companion. More than anything else, the Bulldog is a triumph of the human ability to rehabilitate an entire breed and make it into a desirable, affectionate companion through thoughtful, dedicated breeding practices. In the 1800s, cities such as Rome passed laws that Bulldogs couldn"t be walked on the streets even on leash due to their ferociousness, and yet, a few years later, the Bulldog was already becoming known as one of the friendliest and most tranquil of dogs. All because some dedicated breeders had patience, knowledge, and a vision of what the Bulldog could be at its finest.
Mature male Bulldogs weigh about 50 pounds; mature females about 40 pounds. Show dogs may be about 10 pounds heavier. They stand 12 to 15 inches at the shoulder.
Sociable and sweet, but with a reputation for courage that makes him an excellent watchdog, the Bulldog is a lover, not a fighter. He"s dignified rather than lively and has a kind although occasionally stubborn nature. The Bulldog is friendly and easygoing; he gets along with everyone. He can be a slow learner, but once he knows something, he"s got it for good. Bulldogs don"t tend to be barkers. Usually their appearance alone is enough to frighten off intruders. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who"s available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Bulldogs need early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bulldog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Like all breeds, Bulldogs are prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Bulldogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them so you can be informed when you interview breeders and can know what to look for throughout your Bulldog"s life. Buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Bulldog possible. A puppy from a reputable Bulldog breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed. Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bulldogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbow, and knees, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF), certifying that the eyes are normal. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old. Overall, Bulldogs can have a lot of health problems. They are wonderful dogs, but be sure you"re willing to monitor their health closely and can afford any medical treatment they may need. The following conditions may affect Bulldogs: Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland under the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland. Dry Eye: This condition is caused when natural tear production is inadequate. Signs include a dry appearance or blue haze to the eye. Your vet can perform a test to determine if your Bulldog has dry eye and prescribe medication you can administer to relieve the pain of this condition. Entropion: This is a condition in which the eyelashes turn inward and rub against the eye, causing irritation. It may require surgery to correct. Inverted Or Reverse Sneezing: This isn"t really a health problem but generally occurs when nasal fluids drip down on the Bulldog"s soft palate, causing it to close. It also can occur when your Bulldog gets something in his nose. It sounds a lot worse than it is. Try to calm your Bulldog by stroking his throat and this should pass quickly. Brachycephalic Syndrome: This disorder is found in dogs with short heads, narrowed nostrils, or elongated soft palates. Their airways are obstructed to varying degrees and can cause anything from noisy or labored breathing to total collapse of the airway. Dogs with brachycephalic syndrome commonly snuffle and snort. Treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition but includes oxygen therapy as well as surgery to widen nostrils or shorten palates. Head Shakes. This resembles a fit, but it affects only the head. It"s seen as an involuntary shaking of the head from side-to-side or up-and-down. Sometimes, this is violent. This dog appears to be conscious and aware of what is happening. It may be linked to stress and low blood sugar. Breeders often suggest giving your dog some honey to bring the blood sugar level back up or distracting them to stop the shaking. If the shaking doesn"t appear to be related to stress or over-excitement, you should take him to the vet as soon as possible to make sure he isn"t in pain. Demodectic mange. Also called Demodicosis. All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can"t be passed to humans or even other dogs - only the mother can "give" these mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems. If your Bulldog has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, he can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck, and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. You should take your dog to the vet anyway because this can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. (Enlarged lymph nodes often are a sign that this will occur.) Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over its body. Dogs that develop localized or generalized demodicosis should not be bred because the condition is considered to have a genetic component. Hip Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Most Bulldogs appear to have hip dysplasia based on their hip x-rays, just because they tend to naturally have shallow hip joints, but it"s unusual for them to have the associated problems with lameness unless they"re allowed to become overweight or are exercised too much during their period of rapid growth. If your Bulldog is diagnosed with hip dysplasia, seek a second opinion and look into other treatment options, such as supplements, before agreeing to surgery. Tail Problems. Some Bulldogs have screw tails, inverted tails or other types of "tight" tails that can cause them to have some skin problems. You should keep your Bulldog"s tail clean and dry to prevent infection. Patellar luxation. Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.
Bulldogs are inactive indoors and don"t require a great deal of exercise (although they must be walked every day to keep them from gaining weight). They are indoor dogs and prefer a relaxed lifestyle. After about 15 minutes of play, they"re ready for a nap. This low to moderate energy level makes the Bulldog suited to any type home, from an apartment to a house with a yard. You can take the Bulldog for a walk of a mile or two during the cool part of the day, but he"ll be just as happy with a brief stroll up and down your street. Because of their pushed-in face, Bulldogs don"t do well in extremely hot (or cold) weather. They breathe heavily when they"re hot and don"t dissipate heat well. They"re especially susceptible to heatstroke. As little as half an hour outdoors in 85-degree temperatures can kill them. Provide him with an air-conditioned environment and plenty of fresh water. Bulldogs are also not swimmers. Their massive heads drag them straight down. If you have a pool, spa, or pond, protect your Bulldog from falling in. The Bulldog is unlikely to be an obedience-trial star, but once he learns something, he never forgets it. He learns best through fun training sessions that involve repetition and positive reinforcement through food rewards and praise.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s easy to overfeed a Bulldog, but obesity can stress his joints, so he shouldn"t be allowed to get fat. Keep your adult Bulldog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Bulldog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Your Bulldog"s coat should be straight, short, fine textured, smooth and glossy. He has soft, loose skin, especially on the head, neck, and shoulders. His head is covered with heavy wrinkles and he has two loose folds at the throat (from the jaw to the chest) to form what"s called a dewlap. Bulldogs come in a variety of colors: red brindle; all other brindles; solid white; solid red, fawn, or fallow (pale cream to light fawn, pale yellow, or yellow red; and piebald (large patches of two or more colors). Solid black isn"t common and isn"t much admired. Brush the Bulldog"s smooth, fine, short-haired coat once a week with a firm bristle brush. Wipe his face with a damp cloth every day, taking care to clean inside the wrinkles. Be sure to dry the inside of the wrinkles completely after they"re washed. Some people suggest wiping the wrinkles with baby wipes that have lanolin and aloe vera. If your Bulldog"s skin is irritated inside of the wrinkles, ask your vet to recommend a soothing ointment. After you"ve cleaned the wrinkles, wash your Bulldog"s nose and apply petroleum jelly to it to keep it soft and prevent it from becoming dry and flaky. The Bulldog is an average shedder. If you can take the time to brush him more than once a week, it will help reduce the amount of hair that gets on your clothes and furniture. Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Bulldog"s nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Bulldog to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is for both of you. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
His amiable temperament and bulk make the Bulldog an excellent companion for children, even young ones. A Bulldog will put up with a lot from a child, although he shouldn"t have to, and he"ll walk away if he gets tired of being tormented. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. With their pacific nature, Bulldogs also get along well with other pets, dogs and cats. They may be less sociable toward strange dogs, however.
Bulldogs are sometimes purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Bulldogs end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Bulldog has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they"ve already gone through the destructive puppy stage. The Bulldog Club of America Rescue Network

In 1901, a Mr. Burton of Thorneywood Kennels challenged a group of spectators at a dog show to take on the task of escaping a muzzled dog he had brought with him, the prize being one pound — a large sum of money at the time. The volunteer was a man experienced with dogs, but he must have soon regretted his act. Despite being given a head start, he was pursued, caught, and knocked down by the dog three times. Anyone who knew the dog was a Bullmastiff wouldn"t have been surprised. Developed by gamekeepers on England"s great estates, the dogs served as guardians of the grounds and were bred to be courageous, confident, strong, and fast. Large and powerfully built, the Bullmastiff has a formidable appearance that"s a wonderful deterrent to would-be attackers or intruders. He"s a determined protector when needed and a loving family companion the rest of the time. When he"s well-trained and well-socialized, the Bullmastiff is a confident, trustworthy, and noble credit to the breed and to dogs in general. In one sense, he"s a clean breed, with a short coat that"s easy to groom and doesn"t shed excessively. On the other, he"s a drooler. With this breed it"s advisable to keep a hand towel with you at all times. Despite his size, the Bullmastiff isn"t a high-energy dog. A couple of short walks or playtimes a day will meet his needs. He"s mellow enough to live comfortably in an apartment or condo, as long as he gets his daily outings. Of course, a puppy will have more energy than an adult dog, but he should settle down by the time he"s two years old. Being low-key doesn"t mean he"s lazy. The breed can excel in dog sports such as agility, conformation, obedience and tracking. Bullmastiffs are also super therapy dogs, thanks to their calm nature and comical expression. When it comes to training, he"s an independent thinker. Guide him with firmness, fairness, and consistency from an early age, and he"ll look to you as head of the household. Let him go his own way and he"ll soon be running things, so don"t let that happen. Early socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences — is essential. With this breed"s history of being a guardian dog, the Bullmastiff can do well in homes where both people work as long as he gets plenty of human interaction during at-home hours. It"s okay for them to spend time in a fenced yard or kennel run, but primarily these dogs should live in the home. After all, you want a guardian dog to be Johnny-on-the-spot in the event of an intruder as well as to be emotionally close to you so he"ll want to protect you. The Bullmastiff is a silent watchdog who detains unwelcome visitors with his size and presence, biting only as needed. Bullmastiffs do very well with children and show amazing patience with them. Their size can be overwhelming to toddlers, however. Nor is the Bullmastiff meant to be a baby sitter. No dog should be left unattended with young children. Bullmastiffs can reach a weight of 130 pounds, and most of that is muscle. Living with a Bullmastiff brings the responsibility of ensuring that you have a well-trained and socialized dog. When that"s the case, you"ll find yourself in possession of a wonderful dog who is loving, faithful, and courageous, a huggable lug who"s your best friend.
Bullmastiffs don"t need a lot of exercise and will be happy with a couple of short walks every day. Bullmastiffs can do well in families where both parents work. They are not overly concerned with being alone, but puppies will need someone who can come home to let them out for potty breaks. Bullmastiffs shed little and require only minimal grooming. Bullmastiffs can do well in apartments or condos because they"re so mellow. Bullmastiffs can be aggressive toward other animals if they"re not properly socialized Bullmastiffs should live indoors with their people. Bullmastiffs are prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke and should be kept indoors during hot or humid weather. Bullmastiffs drool and can be prone to gassiness. If wiping up drool bothers you in any way, this is not the breed for you. Bullmastiffs need early training that continues throughout their life. Training and socialization help curb unwanted aggression and willfulness. Large and loving, Bullmastiffs enjoy spending time with you on your couch, feet, and lap. They take up a lot of room but give you lots of love in return. Bullmastiffs can be determined guard dogs and will protect their home and family with their life if the need arises. Their size and confidence is a deterrent to intruders. Bullmastiffs are good with children, but they can accidentally knock over or step on toddlers. Bullmastiffs have a high pain threshold so it can be difficult to determine if the dog is hurt. Never acquire a Bullmastiff from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents. Reputable breeders perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don"t pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases. Interview breeders thoroughly, and make sure the puppy"s parents have been screened for genetic diseases pertinent to that breed. Ask breeders about the health issues they"ve encountered in their dogs, and don"t believe a breeder who claims that her dogs never have any health problems. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they"re happy with their Beardie. Doing your homework may save you from a lot of heartbreak later.
The Bullmastiff is a relatively modern breed that was developed in the mid-19th century, probably around 1860, by English gamekeepers who needed a large, quiet, fearless dog with the speed to track down poachers and the strength to hold them. They probably experimented with a number of breeds in an attempt to create the perfect dog for their needs, but the one that paid off was the Mastiff/Bulldog cross. The Mastiff was large but not aggressive enough, while the Bulldog, brave and tenacious, lacked the size needed to knock down and hold a man. The popular cross became known as the Gamekeeper"s Night-Dog and worked and lived alongside the gamekeeper and his family. The dogs were bred for utility and temperament with little thought put into looks, the exception being a preference for a dark brindle coat, which provided camouflage at night. Poaching eventually declined, and the Bullmastiff took on a new role as a guard dog. As a result of the Mastiff influence, the fawn coat with a black mask became more common as well. It wasn"t until the early 20th century that the Bullmastiff began to be bred as a distinct type rather than as a crossbreed. In 1924, England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed. The American Kennel Club followed suit in 1933. The first Bullmastiff registered by the AKC was Fascination of Felons Fear in 1934. Today the Bullmastiff ranks 40th among the 157 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC, a testament to his qualities as a companion.
A Bullmastiff male is 25 to 27 inches in height and weighs 110 to 130 pounds; females are 24 to 26 inches and weigh 100 to 120 pounds.
The ideal Bullmastiff is fearless and confident, but obedient to his people"s wishes. Smart and reliable, he can be an independent thinker, yet he wants to please. He"s a natural guardian of the home and family and will respond instantly if they"re threatened. Bullmastiffs were bred to be silent watchdogs, so it"s unusual for them to bark. As with every dog, Bullmastiffs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Bullmastiff puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Bullmastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Bullmastiffs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bullmastiffs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, as well as certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. Common health problems in this breed include cancer, hip and elbow dysplasia, torn anterior cruciate ligaments, bloat, subaortic stenosis, skin and coat problems, hypothyroidism, and entropion. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Hypothyroidism: Caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone, this disease may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Bullmastiff has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically, which is best done after the dog reaches maturity at one or two years of age. Subaortic Stenosis: This common heart defect occurs when the aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It"s an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn"t known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Dogs with this condition should not be bred. Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It"s identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred. Gastric Dilatation Volvulus, Gastric Torsion, Bloat: This life-threatening condition can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bullmastiffs, especially if they are fed only one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, or are allowed to exercise vigorously after eating. Raised feeding dishes and the type of food given may also be factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs who develop this condition be neutered or spayed. Ruptured Anterior Cruciate Ligament: This common knee injury tends to occur in large young dogs during play and older overweight dogs. A twisting of the dog"s hind leg, which causes the anterior cruciate ligament to tear or rupture resulting in a sudden lameness in a hind leg. When the ligament is torn or ruptured, the tibia and femur can move against each other. This can lead to arthritis fairly quickly. Surgery is one form of treatment if the ligament is completely torn. If the ligament is only partially torn and other circumstances rule out surgery as an option, the rupture can be treated medically with special instruction on low-impact exercise and, if the dog is overweight, diet. Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically. Cancers found commonly in Bullmastiffs include lymphosarcoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumors. Panosteitis: This is an elusive ailment sometimes seen in young dogs. Its primary sign is sudden lameness, and puppies usually outgrow it by the age of two years with no long-term problems. The lameness can be slight or severe and can be managed with canine pain relievers. Panosteitis is often misdiagnosed as elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, or even more serious disorders. If misdiagnosed, the vet may want to do surgery on your dog that isn"t needed. If signs occur, ask for a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist before allowing surgery to be performed. Skin Problems: Bullmastiffs have sensitive skin that can be prone to rashes, sores, and irritations. They may also be prone to contact or inhalant allergies, caused by a reaction to substances such as detergents or other chemicals or airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Check your Bullmastiff"s skin regularly and treat any rashes quickly. Provide soft, clean bedding in crates and other sleeping areas to prevent sores. Sometimes a change to a diet with few or no chemical additives can help. Other Bullmastiffs need long-term treatment with antibiotics or steroids to keep skin problems under control.
The Bullmastiff is a low-energy dog who can adapt well to most home environments, although his size makes him best suited to a house with a fenced yard. Besides keeping him from roaming and protecting him from traffic, a fence prevents the Bullmastiff from expanding his territory beyond his home and yard, which could cause him to try to prevent other people and dogs from entering the surrounding area. His short muzzle makes the Bullmastiff prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Avoid exercise during the heat of the day, and keep him indoors during hot or humid weather. Be sure he always has access to shade and fresh water when he"s outdoors. Start training your Bullmastiff puppy as soon as you bring him home, while he"s still at a manageable size. Enroll in a puppy socialization class to get him used to being around other dogs and people. This is extremely important for the Bullmastiff, who can be aggressive toward other dogs and people he doesn"t know if he isn"t taught manners. In addition to puppy kindergarten and regular obedience class, take your Bullmastiff to parks, outdoor shopping malls, and other places where he can learn to meet people and become accustomed to new experiences, sights, and sounds. Although he wants to please, the Bullmastiff thinks for himself and needs a confident trainer. Use positive reinforcement techniques, never physical punishment, but be firm and consistent in what you ask of him. Avoid repetitive training, or your Bullmastiff will get bored and start doing his own thing. Think beyond puppyhood. If you don"t want your Bullmastiff on the furniture when he weighs 130 pounds, don"t let him on it when he only weighs 20 pounds. Once a habit is established, it will be difficult to break. Housetraining shouldn"t be a problem as long as you make it a positive experience and provide your pup with a regular potty schedule and plenty of opportunities to go outside. Crate training is a wonderful tool for housetraining and keeping your young puppy from chewing things he shouldn"t. The Bullmastiff needs a firm hand when training, but he also needs love and patience. When he"s trained, you"ll find that he"s a wonderful, caring, and loyal companion who will gladly risk his life to defend yours.
Recommended daily amount: 3 1/8 to 4 1/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Bullmastiff in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Bullmastiff, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Bullmastiff coat is short and dense, offering good protection from rain, snow, and cold. It comes in three colors: red, fawn or brindle (specks and streaks of light and dark markings) with a dark muzzle and ears. Occasionally, a Bullmastiff will have a small white mark on his chest. Bullmastiffs don"t shed heavily, and their coats are easy to keep clean and shiny with a quick daily brushing using a rubber curry. Bathe only as needed. Check the ears weekly and clean as needed with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. If they smell bad or are filled with a waxy material resembling coffee grounds, the dog may have an infection or mite infestation, so take him to a veterinarian. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. If the nails get too long, the toes can become spread out, reducing the support provided by the foot and making it more likely that stickers and small stones will get stuck in the foot. Don"t forget dental hygiene. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease, daily for best results. Grooming provides you with an excellent opportunity to bond with your dog and to check his overall health. As you brush the coat or teeth, clean the ears and trim the nails, look for sores or other signs of irritation such as redness on the skin, mouth, feet, and ears. Eyes should be free of redness or discharge. Begin getting your Bullmastiff used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Bullmastiffs are patient with and protective of children, but because they"re so large, they can accidentally knock over or step on a toddler. If you have children, take their age and size into consideration when deciding whether to get a Bullmastiff. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child to never approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or try to take away the dog"s food. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Bullmastiff may well be aggressive toward dogs he doesn"t know. He does best with dogs of the opposite sex, especially if he"s been raised with them. He can get along with cats if he"s raised with them, although some Bullmastiffs can"t resist the urge to chase them. A cat who stands up for itself will fare better than one who runs away.
Bullmastiffs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Contact rescue organizations for more information about available dogs and adoption requirements.

If you"ve seen the movie The Wizard of Oz, you"ve seen one of the most famous Cairn Terriers ever. The dog who played Toto in the film was a female Cairn named Terry. Paid $125 per week for her role as Toto, she was owned by trainer Carl Spitz, and she had appeared in several movies prior to her famous role in Oz. She lived to be 11 years old. The film character Toto is characteristically Cairn: a small, sturdy, shaggy-coated terrier who"s highly intelligent and confident. The breed is alert and always ready for action. The Cairn is also curious and quick to learn. And, like all terriers, he"s independent and a bit stubborn. He must know who is in charge, or he will take charge. Early obedience training and socialization are essential. In spite of his independent nature, the Cairn is a sensitive dog. His feelings are easily hurt, and he doesn"t respond well to scolding or harsh corrections. Kind, positive training is the best method for teaching the Cairn. There is little this smart dog can"t learn. With proper training, a Cairn can master an unlimited number of tricks and commands. However, it may be downright impossible to stop a Cairn from doing what Terriers love to do: chase (and dig and bark). The Cairn will chase squirrels, cats, rabbits, and other dogs if given a chance. For this reason, he should only be walked in public places on a leash, and he should be given free run only in a securely fenced yard. The Cairn actively loves kids and will patiently bear their boisterous ways. Of course, children should not be left alone with dogs of any breed, including the Cairn, and responsible adults should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs. The Cairn Terrier is a family dog, and he needs to live in the house (or apartment or condo) with his family. He thrives on attention from his loved ones, and he"s unhappy if left alone too much. He can become bored at such times, which leads to destructive or annoying behaviors like barking, digging, or chewing. A Cairn Terrier is a wonderful family companion. He"s fun and entertaining, loves to play with kids, and sounds the alarm when visitors approach. He is able to compete in obedience, agility, or Earthdog trials. A Cairn is a great pet for anyone who wants an independent, alert companion with a take-charge attitude toward life.
The Cairn is a Terrier, which means his natural instincts are to bark, dig, and chase. These behaviors can be minimized with training, but they can"t be eliminated. If you don"t enjoy the typical terrier temperament, you should consider another breed. The Cairn is intelligent and curious. He also has a mind of his own. He will challenge your authority — good naturedly, of course — but you must be able to establish and maintain your role as pack leader, or he"ll get the upper hand. The Cairn loves the attention of his family. Do not leave him alone for long periods of time or he may become destructive. The Cairn Terrier often thinks he"s bigger than he actually is. Don"t be surprised if he stands up for himself against large dogs or animals. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Cairn Terrier was developed more than 200 years ago on the Isle of Skye, where Captain Martin MacLeod is credited with developing one of the oldest strains of the breed. All terrier breeds in Scotland were originally classified as Scotch Terriers. In 1873, a new system was implemented and Scotch Terriers were separated into two classes: Dandie Dinmont Terriers and Skye Terriers. The Skye Terrier classification included Cairns as well as dogs that are now known as Scottish Terriers, West Highland White Terriers. These breeds were distinguished only by color, as all three could come from the same litter. A club for Hard-Haired Scotch Terriers was formed for the three breeds in 1881; a standard was approved in 1882. Toward the end of the 19th century, Scottish Terrier breeders began to select for different characteristics, color among them. The West Highland White Terrier became a separate breed in 1908. In 1912, the Cairn Terrier was designated as a breed, taking its name from the piles of stones that marked ancient Scottish burial or memorial sites. These stone piles were often hideouts for the vermin sought by the terriers. The first Cairn Terriers were imported to the United States by Mrs. Henry F. Price and Mrs. Byron Rodgers in 1913. In both the U.S. and in England, the Cairn and the West Highland White were interbred until 1917, when the American Kennel Club barred registration to any dog from such interbreeding. That same year, the Cairn Terrier Club of America was granted AKC membership.
Males stand 10 inches tall and weigh 14 pounds. Females stand 9.5 inches tall and weigh 13 pounds.
The Cairn Terrier is a wonderfully friendly dog. He"s happy and cheerful, and he seems to truly enjoy meeting people. He"s also all terrier: independent, tough, and alert. Like any dog of the breed, he places digging, barking, and chasing high on his list of fun activities. He"ll chase any small animal, including the neighbor"s cat, if given a chance. He"s a good watchdog, too, and will announce any visitor. Though independent, the Cairn is devoted to his family and is happiest when he"s part of his owners" daily lives. He likes to be in the house, playing with the kids, following you room to room, joining you at the front door when you greet a friend. He"s also known for being sensitive. He doesn"t like to be scolded and is upset when you"re not happy with him. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Cairn needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Cairn puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Cairns are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cairns will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Cairns, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Craniomandibular Osteopathy: This affects the skull bones of a growing puppy, causing them to become irregularly enlarged. Symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. Often the puppy"s jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won"t be able to open his mouth. He"ll drool, have a fluctuating fever that recurs every couple of weeks, and, in some cases, his chewing muscles may atrophy. Anti-inflammatories and pain relievers help the dog deal with what is a painful condition. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent jaw problems and therefore have trouble eating. Occasional cases are severe enough to call for jaw surgery. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both of the testicles to descend into the scrotum. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is two months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if not removed. Treatment is surgical neutering. Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy: Also known as Krabbe"s disease, this is a degenerative disease of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Affected puppies die at a very early age or are euthanized. There is now a test available that can identify carriers of this disease. Breeding dogs should be tested. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This affliction involves the hip joint. If your Cairn has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Ocular Melanosis/Secondary Glaucoma: Formerly called pigmentary glaucoma, this is a fairly recent development in the United States (since 1984). It is a painful inherited condition that occurs primarily in Cairns between seven and 12 years old. The condition generally affects both eyes. Watch both eyes for small spots or patches of very dark pigmentation within the sclera (white part of the eye). The pigment deposits accumulate and decrease ability of fluid to drain out of the anterior chamber. This leads to increased pressure, which is known as secondary glaucoma. If diagnosed early, the condition can be controlled with medication. Portosystemic Liver Shunt: This is a congenital abnormality in which blood vessels allow blood to bypass the liver. As a result, the blood is not cleansed by the liver as it should be. Surgery is usually the best option.
Caring for a Cairn Terrier isn"t difficult. Because of his small size, he"s a good dog for apartment dwellers, but he"s also hardy enough to enjoy ranch life. He must have sufficient exercise and activity, however. A long daily walk or vigorous play for 20 to 30 minutes will help keep him healthy and alert. Despite the fact that he"s a quick study, remember that the Cairn also has a stubborn streak. Regular obedience training (beginning with puppy classes) is essential to teach him good manners and respect for your authority. Don"t be surprised if he challenges you — just keep training. Be positive, kind, and consistent. A "quiet" command should be one of your Cairn"s basics. Don"t let him off-leash in public places; he"s likely to give in to any temptation to chase. And don"t give him unsupervised free time in the yard. He"ll dig, and he doesn"t care whether he excavates a secluded area by the fence or your lovely new flower garden.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Cairn in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Cairn, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The scruffy-looking Cairn Terrier has a double coat: a wiry outer coat and soft undercoat. The coat comes in many colors, including red, brindle, black, sand, and gray. This coat is easy to groom. A thorough brushing once a week is sufficient, as is periodic bathing (every three months or so, or as needed). Frequent bathing isn"t recommended because it softens the coarse terrier coat. While a soft coat isn"t harmful to any dog, and is fine for a pet, it does detract from a show Cairn"s physical appearance. Some trimming is necessary for the Cairn — mostly to tidy his look, not radically style his locks. If he"s to be a show dog, his coat isn"t trimmed with clippers (as is the Poodle"s coat, for example), but shortened or shaped by stripping with a stripping knife. Stripping isn"t really necessary for a family pet, however; a professional trim with clippers two to three times a year is fine (though be aware that this practice softens the breed"s naturally coarse coat). Brush your Cairn"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Cairn to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Cairn Terrier loves kids and is highly tolerant of them. In fact, he enjoys the noise and commotion that goes along with children. As for other pets, a properly socialized and trained Cairn tends to get along with and respect those in the household. He"s apt to chase any other animal that comes into his yard, however. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Cairns are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Cairns in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Cairn rescue. Cairn Terrier Club of America Rescue Contacts

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 7 inches to 2 feet tall at the shoulderWeight:  35 to 55 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
Dogs were an elemental part of ancient Middle Eastern communities, where they were used to herd and guard the flocks of sheep that were a man"s wealth. Known as Kelef Kanani, Hebrew words meaning Canaan Dog, those primitive dogs survived for thousands of years, into the modern era, and still retain the traits that allowed them to live in harsh desert conditions. Today"s Canaan Dog has the same smooth coat, prick ears, and bushy tail as his ancestors, and no doubt the same alert, watchful, inquisitive nature that made him a well-regarded herding dog. This agile dog can change directions quickly and moves at a brisk trot, covering ground more rapidly than you can imagine.Besides his pleasing form and graceful movement, the Canaan Dog is blessed with an endearing and responsive personality. Although his heritage of desert survival gives him a certain degree of independence, a Canaan Dog who"s been properly socialized loves his family and is adaptable to many living situations. Life in an apartment with several short daily walks is as agreeable to him as living in a suburban home with a yard and three noisy kids. While this breed is active, its energy level isn"t excessive. And the Canaan Dog"s territorial nature makes him unlikely to stray far from home, although, like any dog, he should be protected from traffic and other dangers by a fenced yard.This is a versatile breed. While the Canaan Dog doesn"t excel in any one area, he is smart and quick to learn, ready and willing to engage in almost any doggy activity, from tracking to herding, obedience to agility. He draws the line only at jumping into a cold lake to retrieve a bird. Today"s Canaan retains primitive herding skills and some have been herding-tested with excellent results. The Canaan"s herding instinct is not as powerful as that of some other breeds, notably the Border Collie, nor does he have the single-mindedness of certain sporting breeds. Few Canaans will retrieve a ball a hundred times in a row. In behavior, as in appearance, the Canaan is a moderate.Nonetheless, this is a dog who requires firm but loving handling as well as early socialization in puppyhood to counteract tendencies toward aloofness and aggression toward other dogs. Experienced dog owners will find the Canaan easy to train, but first-timers can have their hands full. A confident attitude and the help of a good trainer can ease the way. This intelligent dog responds best to motivational techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play. He"s easily bored with repetitive training and requires a challenging and creative learning environment.It"s also important to provide him with strong, firm leadership. A Canaan who decides he"s in charge instead of you will make his own decisions about who is allowed onto his property, and this can lead to serious behavior problems.Canaan Dogs are considered highly reactive, an excellent survival trait. Reacting quickly when confronted with something new and being cautious or suspicious in new situations can save a dog"s life and are among the reasons the breed survived to the present day. Canaan breeders have worked to maintain the breed"s character, so these traits are still present, making them excellent watchdogs.The breed is an excellent and vocal watchdog, so be prepared for some barking. Canaans are keenly alert and will notice anything new or any new person on their property. They will bark to alert you to someone"s presence but will keep their distance, circling and hanging back while watching what is going on. This causes some people to consider them shy, but it"s their method of responding to new or potentially dangerous situations.Canaan Dogs get along well with children, considering them part of their pack and treating them gently. They also do well with other small pets in the household that they are raised with, including cats.The Canaan Dog has been used for centuries to herd and guard flocks and encampments, and more recently they"ve been used as mine detectors, trackers, and alert dogs. They compete in herding, agility, conformation, and obedience.While he"s loyal and affectionate, the Canaan isn"t a glutton for attention. He"s capable of occupying himself as needed. This doesn"t mean, of course, that he should be stuck out in the backyard all the time with no human interaction. Like any dog, Canaans are social animals who enjoy being with their people. They make wonderful companions and protectors of their family and property. If you understand and appreciate the unique qualities of this breed and are willing and able to live with a primitive breed who retains the instincts and behaviors that have kept him around for thousands of years, the Canaan Dog may be the ideal companion for you.
The Canaan Dog is not the best choice for first-time dog owners. Canaans are a primitive breed and are more concerned with pack order than some breeds. They will attempt to wrest "pack" leadership from a passive owner. They need extensive and continual socialization throughout their life to help them recognize what is a threat and what is not. Canaan Dogs can be dog-aggressive. Some cannot live with a dog of the same sex, and some extend the aggression to any dog that they meet. Canaans are aloof with strangers. Canaan Dogs bark when something is new or different in their territory. They can become nuisance barkers if they aren"t taught when to stop or if they"re frequently left alone for long periods. They do not make good guard dogs as their suspicion of new people and things can make them indiscriminate about who and what is a threat. Canaan Dogs require a securely fenced yard. They like to dig and can turn your nicely manicured lawn into a plot that resembles the surface of the moon. Their intelligence makes them highly trainable, but their independent nature and difficulty with motivation can make it questionable whether they will choose to listen to you. When it comes to training, they have a "what"s in it for me?" attitude. They shed profusely twice a year and shed smaller amounts throughout the rest of the year. Canaan Dogs are a rare breed, with only about 1,600 in the world. If you want a Canaan Dog puppy, expect to spend time on a waiting list. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
In the Bible, the book of Exodus calls Canaan — ancient Palestine and Phoenicia from about 3,000 BCE — a good and spacious land, flowing with milk and honey. Flocks of sheep and goats prospered there, and where there are flocks, there are dogs. The dogs of these ancient Middle Eastern communities were known as Kelef Kanani, Hebrew words meaning Canaan Dog. It"s likely that the Kelef Kanani differed little from his modern-day descendant, the Canaan Dog. Tomb drawings from Beni Hassan in Egypt, which date to 2200-2000 BCE, show dogs with smooth coats, prick ears, and bushy tails curling over their backs. No doubt they had the same alert, watchful, inquisitive expression that marks today"s Canaan Dog, a breed that may well be a living portrait of early domesticated dogs.The Middle Eastern herding dogs of the past kept their charges from straying, protected them from predators or thieves, and sounded the alarm when danger was near. But over the centuries, with the invasion of Roman conquerors and the dispersal of the land"s inhabitants to the far corners of the earth, the Canaan Dog became unemployed. He retreated to the hilly desert of southern Israel, living a feral lifestyle that depended on his wits and fitness. Sometimes he continued in his nomadic life, earning a living with the Bedouin desert dwellers, or served as guards for the Druse, religious communities of hill people who made their home on Mount Carmel and other areas of what are now Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Israel. Sculpted by this harsh lifestyle, the dog became a wily athlete, perfectly suited to his environment.For centuries, the Canaan Dog continued his unfettered life in the desert, but in 1935, world events conspired to bring him back into the human community. Not only was World War II brewing, an independent Jewish state was in the offing. Isolated Jewish settlements in Palestine needed guard dogs that could withstand desert conditions, and the area"s armed forces were looking for a desert-tough guard and patrol dog. Rudolphina Menzel, a professor of animal and comparative psychology at the University of Tel Aviv, was asked to develop a dog that would meet these needs. Her original plan was to work with established breeds, but in her mind"s eye she kept picturing Canaan Dogs that she had seen in the desert. They had survival skills, and that was what was needed.Dr. Menzel and her husband acquired several of the desert dogs and began breeding them, recording and refining their bloodlines. They trained their new breed for sentry work, land mine detection, and message delivery, and they were active with the Middle East Forces during World War II. After the war, some of the dogs took up second careers as guide dogs. By 1948, the Palestine Kennel Club had registered 150 of them.In 1965, Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, imported four Canaan Dogs. The Canaan Dog Club of America was formed the same year. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1992 and the American Kennel Club in 1997. The breed entered the national spotlight in 1998 when Ch. Catalina"s Felix to the Max became the first Canaan Dog to compete in the Herding Group at the Westminster Kennel Club show. He"s still a rare breed, ranking 150th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Male Canaan Dogs stand 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weigh 45 to 55 pounds; females are smaller at 19 to 23 inches and 35 to 45 pounds.
The Canaan is described as alert, vigilant, devoted, and docile with his family. He"s aloof toward strangers, although he should never be shy or aggressive, and highly territorial. His territoriality, which kicks in at about age 2, makes the Canaan a good alarm dog. He"s sure to bark whenever anyone comes to the door, settling back down once he"s certain you have the situation under control. That"s assuming he views you as leader of the pack. If he doesn"t, he may try to run things himself and make his own decisions about who"s welcome and who"s not. You must be willing and able to be a strong leader when you live with a Canaan.The breed requires extensive socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences — and not just for a few months in puppyhood but for several years, if not a lifetime. A dog who has been exposed to a variety of people and situations while young will be less stressed and less likely to overreact when confronted with something new as an adult. If you plan to show or compete with your Canaan in any type of dog sport, socialization and training are essential to your success. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.Some Canaan Dogs go through a fear period starting at 9 to 12 months of age, which can last for as long as a year. They may be especially anxious around strangers and bark at seemingly harmless objects. During this period, be calm and confident, showing him that he has nothing to fear. Trying to soothe him will only encourage him to believe that there really is something out there waiting to get him.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
Canaans are a hardy breed and don"t suffer from any known hereditary health problems.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Canaans, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Canaan"s dense undercoat allows him to spend time outdoors in all kinds of weather, but when his people are home, he should be a housedog. He requires a securely fenced yard to protect him from traffic and from altercations with other dogs. With a consistent schedule, he"s easy to housetrain.Canaans love to dig and can make quite large excavations in a short period if left to their own devices. Provide them with a digging area they can call their own or redirect the digging tendency with other activities.The Canaan doesn"t require extensive exercise. He"s usually satisfied with a couple of short walks a day or a walk plus some vigorous playtime in the backyard.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Canaan in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Canaan Dog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Canaan Dogs have a double coat that insulates them from desert temperature extremes. The outer coat is straight and harsh to the touch, lying flat on the body, with a slight ruff on the neck. The undercoat is short and soft. The thickness of the undercoat varies depending on the climate in which the dog lives. The bushy tail tapers to a pointed tip.Canaans can be predominantly white with a mask and sometimes additional large patches of color, or they can be a solid color, ranging from black to all shades of brown, including sandy, red, or liver, with or without white trim on the chest, belly, feet, lower part of the legs, and tail tip. Solid brown or tan dogs sometimes have shadings of black.Shedding is minimal, and little brushing is needed to keep the coat in good condition. Weekly brushing with a stiff bristle brush will do the trick, although you may need to brush more frequently during the twice yearly shedding of the undercoat. The Canaan Dog is a relatively clean dog with no doggie odor and does not require frequent bathing.Brush your Canaan"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Canaan enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Canaan to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Canaans are gentle with children, devoted and protective. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how loving, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Canaans can get along with other dogs, if they"re brought up with them and socialized extensively, but they tend to play rough with a lot of vocalization. To people who don"t know the breed, they may seem aggressive toward other dogs. They can be, but it"s important to be able to tell the difference between rough play and true aggression. Study dog body language so you can know when to interfere and when to relax and let them be dogs. That said, adult Canaans are not the best candidates for playing at off-leash dog parks. They may try to bully or interfere with the play of other dogs. They can also be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex.Canaans do best with cats when they"re raised with them and when the cat is savvy enough to stand up to the dog instead of running from him. Running activates the Canaan"s prey drive, and he will give chase. The breed"s strong prey drive can lead them to chase and kill small animals, especially those they find outdoors. They are probably not a good choice for families with pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils.
Canaan Dogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Canaans in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Canaan rescue. The Canaan Dog Club of America, Inc.

The Cane Corso (Corso for short) is a serious dog breed for a person who is serious about having a dog as a companion and who can provide him with the firm and loving guidance he needs to become a great dog. He is a family-only dog. Don’t expect him to buddy up with everyone he meets: He has no interest in people or other animals outside his family, but those within the family will have his undivided loyalty and protection.Give this dog a job. He’s unwilling to just lie around all day and will find his own “work” to do if you don’t provide it: usually running the fence and barking at passersby, digging holes to China, or chewing up your furniture. If you have a farm or ranch, he will help you with the livestock; otherwise, get him involved in a dog sport such as agility, dock diving, nose work, obedience, or tracking. 
The Corso’s short coat comes in black, light, and dark shades of gray; light and dark shades of fawn; and red. Any of these colors may have a brindle pattern: irregular streaks of light and dark color. Solid fawn and red Corsos may have a black or gray mask. The Corso’s ears may be cropped or uncropped. The Corso is a working dog who needs lots of mental and physical stimulation. Corsos are not demonstrative, but they enjoy “talking” to their people with “woo woo woo” sounds, snorts, and other verbalizations. The Corso is not a good “first dog.” He requires plenty of socialization, training, and exercise to be a good companion.
The Corso is one of many Mastiff-type dogs. This one was developed in Italy and is said to descend from Roman war dogs. He is more lightly built than his cousin, the Neapolitan Mastiff, and was bred to hunt game, guard property, and be an all-around farm hand. Their work included rounding up pigs or cattle and helping to drive them to market.The word “cane,” of course, is Latin for dog and derives from the word “canis.” The word “corso” may come from “cohors,” meaning bodyguard, or from “corsus,” an old Italian word meaning sturdy or robust.The breed declined as farming became more mechanized and came near to extinction, but starting in the 1970s dog fanciers worked to rebuild the Corso. The Society Amatori Cane Corso was formed in 1983, and the Federation Cynologique Internationale recognized the breed in 1996.A man named Michael Sottile imported the first litter of Corsos to the United States in 1988, followed by a second litter in 1989. The International Cane Corso Association was formed in 1993. Eventually, the breed club sought recognition from the American Kennel Club, which was granted in 2010. The breed is now governed by the Cane Corso Association of America.
The Corso is a large, muscular dog. Males stand 25 to 27.5 inches at the withers; females 23.5 to 26 inches. Weight is proportionate to height and typically ranges from 90 to 120 pounds.
The Corso’s history describes him as having a “vigorous temperament, ready to meet any challenge.” That type of temperament can be a double-edged sword. With a confident, consistent owner who provides good leadership and prevents the dog from roaming, the Corso can be an excellent family dog who is never inappropriately aggressive, but in the wrong hands he can become aggressive and be a danger to the public. In July, two Corsos were in the news after they attacked and killed a jogger.The ideal Corso is docile and affectionate toward his family, including children. To get him to that point requires socialization and training from an early age. This dog will not do well in a home with anyone who is afraid of or dislikes dogs or is unable to manage a large dog.The Corso is highly intelligent. Combine that with his bossy nature, and it’s easy to see how he could come to dominate the household without firm leadership and boundaries. He will test you to see how far he can go. It’s important to let him know from the start what the rules are and to ensure that all family members understand the rules as well. Institute a “nothing in life is free” policy by requiring him to perform a command such as “Sit” or “Down” before rewarding him with a meal, treats, or a toy.Firm leadership does not mean hitting the dog — ever. That not only sends the wrong message but can also be dangerous with a large, powerful dog. The sensitive Corso understands tone of voice and responds well to praise and rewards when he has done something you like as well as to firm, rapid corrections and consistent enforcement of rules when you don’t like what he’s doing. Being calm, quiet, and self-assured will get you a lot farther with this dog than angry bluster. Consistency will allow him to relax and know you are in charge.Help the young Corso develop confidence by letting him spend time alone. This can be outdoors in a confined area such as a yard or kennel or in his crate while you are busy around the house and can’t supervise. Being alone for varying periods teaches him he’s all right on his own and you always come back.Like every dog, the Corso needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Socialization helps to ensure your Corso puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog, unafraid of strangers, children, other animals, or being left alone when necessary. Without a lot of experience of the world, he can easily become fearful or aggressive. The more you socialize him, the better able he will be to determine what’s normal behavior and what actions require him to respond in a protective way.According to the Italian breed standard, the Corso should be indifferent when approached and should only react when a real threat is present. The Corso is a working breed and is required to function under high levels of stress. A Corso who cannot maintain its dictated temperament under stressful situations is one with incorrect temperament for the breed.
Corsos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Corsos will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.The Corso can be prone to hip dysplasia; eyelid abnormalities such as entropion, ectropion, and cherry eye; demodectic mange (which can be heritable); and gastric torsion, also known as bloat.Expect breeders to have up-to-date health clearances certifying that a puppy’s parents are free of eye disease and hip dysplasia. Clearances should be in the form of an eye exam by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist with the results registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and an OFA or Pennhip evaluation of the hips. You can confirm health clearances by checking the website of the Canine Health Information Center. You should also ask if any of the breeder’s dogs have ever suffered bloat or mange.
This working breed needs plenty of physical activity to stay in shape. Plan on taking him for a brisk walk or jog of at least a mile, morning and evening, every day. If you like to bicycle, get an attachment that will allow him to run alongside you.Go easy on puppies. Their musculoskeletal system isn’t fully developed until they are about 18 months old, so while they need more walks to help burn off their puppy energy, those walks should be shorter and slower.For mental stimulation, provide this dog with a job. Good employment for a Corso includes herding livestock (your own or a trainer’s), learning tricks, practicing obedience skills, or being involved in a dog sport. Spend at least 20 minutes a day on these types of activities. It’s okay to break it up: for instance, 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening.Never allow a Corso to run loose. A solid, secure fence is a must. An electronic fence will not prevent him from leaving your property if he chooses to, and it won’t protect your neighbor’s dog or cat if he wanders into your yard.Finally, be prepared for the amount of care and large bills that can go along with owning a large dog. There’s more poop to scoop, and essentials such as spay/neuter surgery are more expensive for big dogs than for small ones. If your Corso needs surgery for any other reason, the cost of anesthesia will be high because he needs more of it than a small dog, as well as larger amounts of pain medication after surgery. Finally, there are the costs of training class, entry fees for dog sports, and pet-sitting or boarding when you are away from home. Take all of these expenses into consideration before acquiring a Corso because you will be facing them for 10 to 12 years.
Recommended daily amount: If you are feeding a high-quality dry food, your Corso will probably eat 4 to 5 cups a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Corso in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Corso, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Corso has a short, stiff coat with a light undercoat. It can be black, gray, red or fawn and may or may not have a brindle pattern. The coat sheds heavily twice a year, so have a good vacuum cleaner on hand to suck up the dust bunnies.If you plan to bathe your Corso on a regular basis, accustom him to the experience at an early age. Bathe him weekly as a young pup, teaching him the command “Bath,” so that he learns to expect and accept it. Give him plenty of praise and rewards to sweeten the deal.Brush your Cane Corso’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced at trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Check ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Corso to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
When he is properly raised, trained, and socialized, the Corso can be loving toward and protective of children. It’s important, however, that puppies and adult dogs not be given any opportunity to chase children and that kids avoid making high-pitched sounds in his presence. Running and squealing may cause the Corso to associate children with prey. Keep him confined when kids are running around outdoors and making lots of noise, especially if your children have friends over. The Corso may think it necessary to step in and protect “his” kids, and that is unlikely to end well. Games of fetch or — for young children — helping to hold the leash are good ways for children to interact with a Cane Corso puppy or adult.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how loving, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Corso may get along with other dogs or cats if he is raised with them, but he will likely view strange animals as prey and do his best to kill them. It’s essential to be able to protect neighbors’ pets from him. This is another instance in which socialization is a must. Your Cane Corso should learn from an early age to remain calm in the presence of other dogs. If you do get a second dog, either another Cane Corso or a different breed, it is best to choose one of the opposite sex.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  10 inches to 1 foot tall at the shoulderWeight:  25 to 38 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
In Wales, a tiny fairy tale land studded with misty mountains and mysterious standing stones, the fairies ride little longbacked dogs, following the wild hunt across a moonlit sky. A few lucky mortals learned of the fairies’ canine treasure and acquired the dogs for themselves. They are known as Corgis, from the Welsh words “cor gi,” meaning “dwarf dog,” and they are among the oldest of the herding breeds.Until 1934, the Welsh Corgi was considered to be a single breed, but these days the dogs are recognized as two separate varieties — the Cardigan and the Pembroke — with distinct histories and characteristics. Cardigans belong to the American Kennel Club’s Herding Group and are recognized by the United Kennel Club.Besides his long tail, the Cardigan stands out from the Pembroke by his slightly larger size, longer body, heavier head and bigger, more rounded ears. Males typically weigh 30 to 38 pounds. Females are a bit smaller and usually weigh 25 to 34 pounds.Cardigan Welsh Corgis, also known as Cardigans, Cardis or CWCs, have an alert, watchful, yet friendly expression. Their dense double coat, which sheds heavily, comes in all shades of red, sable, and brindle; black, with or without tan or brindle points; or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. They usually have white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, belly and tail tip and may have a blaze on the head.The official AKC breed standard is maintained by the Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America.
Cardigans are vocal dogs. They bark at anything and everything. Cardigans are intelligent but can be stubborn. If housetraining is a problem, crate training is advised. Cardigans have a strong herding instinct that may cause them to nip at the heels of your children when they are playing. Cardigans like to eat and will overeat if given a chance. Be sure to monitor their food intake so they don"t become obese. Cardigans have a lot of energy and need daily exercise. Cardigans should never be purchased from unknowledgeable breeders, puppy mills, or pet stores.
The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is descended from the same family of dogs that produced the Dachshund and the Basset Hound. The ancestors of modern-day Cardis are believed to have been brought to Wales more than 3,000 years ago by Celtic tribes who migrated to Wales from central Europe. This early dog was a transitional form between the Teckel and the Spitz families. Some believe that when the Vikings invaded Wales, the Spitz-type dogs they brought with them were crossed with the original Corgi to produce the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.Cardigans were working dogs, helping to herd farmers’ cattle and keep them safe from predators. They also helped farmers drive their cattle to the fields and to the market. They were treasured as cattle dogs, guardian dogs, family pets, and vermin exterminators. So prized were the dogs and so vital were they to the financial well-being of the farmers that an ancient Welsh law placed severe penalties upon anyone who would harm or steal one of them.Cardigan Welsh Corgis were first shown in English dog shows in 1919 and the English Cardigan Welsh Corgi Association was founded in 1926. At that time, the Cardigans and Pembrokes were considered one breed, and often were interbred, which caused a great deal of strife among breeders.In the mid and late 1920s, a red and white dog named Bob Llwyd influenced the breed a great deal. It’s said that the first breed standard was based upon him. He sired the breed’s first champion, Ch. Golden Arrow, who was born in 1928 and finished his championship in 1931.Also in 1931, Mrs. B.P. Bole imported the first pair of Cardigans into the United States. One was a female named Cassie who was already a well established producer of high quality Cardigans in England. Although she was mismarked, being white with brindle patches, she produced excellent pups. One of her pups, named Megan, became the first U.S. champion of the breed. Today, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America, Inc. holds an annual contest for champions only, named the Megan Competition.In 1934, the British Kennel Club declared Pembrokes and Cardigans to be separate breeds, thereby ending any questions about interbreeding the two. The next year, the American Kennel Club recognized Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis.The Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America was founded in 1935. The Cardigan has gone from the Non-Sporting to the Working to the Herding Group at American Kennel Club (AKC) dog shows. Because the parent club has always been committed to preventing commercialization of their dogs, they aren’t as well-known as the Pembroke, but they always have a special place in the hearts of those who know and love them.Today, the breed standard is maintained by The Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America.
Cardigans are 10.5 to 12.5 inches tall. Males weigh 30 to 38 pounds; females 25 to 34 pounds.
The Cardigan doesn’t spend much time herding cattle these days, although he still has the instinct for it. He is a family companion and show dog with an adaptable personality and responsible nature. You will often find the Cardigan living with horse owners, who appreciate his assistance in loading their horses into trailers.The Cardigan can be less sociable and more territorial than the Pembroke. True to his herding dog heritage, the Cardi is an alert watchdog and may be reserved toward strangers. Expect him to bark a warning at the sight, scent or sound of anything unusual.He is a sturdy friend for children, and his intelligence makes him highly trainable. That said, he is an independent thinker and will often choose to do things his own way, adding a special Cardigan twist to obedience commands and other directives.Like every dog, the Cardigan needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Socialization helps to ensure that your Cardigan puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Cardigan Welsh Corgis are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cardigans will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.In Cardigans, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that eyes are normal; and a DNA test for progressive retinal atrophy. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org) and the CERF web site (vmdb.org/cerf.html). Intervertebral Disk Disease: Because of their long backs, Cardigans are prone to ruptures in a spinal disc. Signs include unsteadiness, difficulty going up or down stairs or on and off furniture, knuckling over of limbs, weakness, and paralysis. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.
Like a fine sports car, the Cardigan has a body that is low-slung and fast. As a herding breed, he is capable of moving flocks long distances each day. Even if he doesn’t do that for a living anymore, he still needs daily exercise in the form of a walk or training for a dog sport such as agility. If he gets the activity he needs, the Cardigan is happy in any environment, from city condo to country estate.With his short legs and long back, the Cardigan can be prone to back injuries. Because their skeletal development is not yet complete, avoid letting puppies jump on and off furniture. Don’t pick them up without supporting both the front legs and the rear end.The Cardigan has a weather-resistant coat designed to withstand the harsh weather of Wales, but that doesn’t mean he’s an outside dog. He is highly people-oriented and should not be shunted off to the backyard with little human interaction.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Cardigans like to eat, and will over-indulge if given the chance. Keep your Cardi in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Cardigan, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Cardis are double-coated, with a short undercoat and a longer, thick topcoat. They shed continuously, with periods of heavier shedding at least twice a year. Be prepared to brush a Cardigan frequently to keep flying hair under control. Daily brushing and warm baths to remove excess coat may be necessary during shedding season.The coat comes in all shades of red, sable, and brindle; black, with or without tan or brindle points; or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. They usually have white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, belly and tail tip and may have a blaze on the head.The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Cardis have soft, fluffy coats, which are not desirable because they don’t protect the dog from the elements.Many Cardigans have what is called a "fairy saddle" over their back. This marking takes its name from the legend that fairies rode the dogs in their home country of Wales.Brush your Cardigan’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally.

Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Cardigans love children, but their herding instincts can motivate them to nip at a youngster’s feet or ankles. They can learn quickly, however, that this behavior is not permitted.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Cardigans are usually friendly toward other pets in the household, so long as they have been socialized with them. They can be aggressive toward dogs that aren’t part of their family, but they enjoy having a second or third dog in the family to play with, especially another Corgi.
Some Cardigans, purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one or given up because their families can no longer keep them, are in need of adoption or fostering. Not all rescue groups are listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Cardigan rescue organization.

Louisiana"s "hog dog" is a jambalaya of native American dogs, Spanish Mastiffs, and Greyhounds. Catahoulas were created to track and drive feral hogs and cattle when it was time to butcher them, and not surprisingly they are aggressively resolute in their work. This tough yet strikingly beautiful dog can have a spotted, brindle, solid, or patched coat of many colors. Other outstanding physical characteristics are his webbed feet, which allow him to swim well and work in soft, marshy areas, and his eyes, which may be blue, green, brown, or amber. Some Catahoulas have eyes that are each a different color or "cracked" eyes: two different colors within the same eye. Befitting their heritage as herding and driving dogs, Catahoulas are wary of strangers. They"re protective of their families and opinionated about who is and isn"t trustworthy. People who live with them say they"re excellent judges of character. Expect to provide this hard-working and independent dog with at least an hour of strenuous exercise daily as well as firm guidance during training. When their exercise and leadership needs are met, Catahoulas are loving, calm, and dedicated companions.
The Catahoula should not be left to live outside. He"s a companion dog and does poorly in isolation. Because he may be aggressive toward unknown dogs, a Catahoula should never be walked off leash. Catahoulas are highly intelligent and need firm, patient, consistent training. Catahoulas are energetic dogs who need at least an hour of vigorous exercise daily. Catahoulas shed lightly to moderately year-round. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny. The Catahoula needs early and frequent socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals. The Catahoula is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. Catahoula puppies need tough, durable toys. The ideal home for a Catahoula is one with a fenced yard and opportunities for the dog to perform its natural work of tracking and herding. Catahoulas are protective of the children in their family, but they are not four-legged babysitters. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs. If properly socialized and raised with them, Catahoulas can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Catahoulas may never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes. Catahoulas can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially if both dogs are male. Catahoulas are alert watchdogs and wary of strangers. Never buy a Catahoula from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
Named for a Choctaw Indian word meaning "sacred lake," the Catahoula originated in northern Louisiana near Catahoula Lake. He"s probably the product of breedings between local dogs and the Bloodhounds, Mastiffs, and Greyhounds brought to the area by Spanish explorers. They are sometimes known as Catahoula curs, Catahoula leopard curs, or Catahoula hounds, but the name was officially changed to Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog when they became the state dog of Louisiana. The Catahoula was used to track and round up the wild hogs that roamed the forests, hence the name hog dog that he sometimes goes by. The Louisiana Catahoula Cur Association was formed in 1976, followed by the National Association of Louisiana Catahoulas in 1977. Other organizations are the Catahoula Cur Breeders Association, which registers Catahoulas, and the American Catahoula Association, which works to promote and maintain the breed"s conformation and working ability through shows, clinics, trials and certified testing. Events include Treeing, Hog Bay, Cow Bay, and Cow Trials. The breed was named state dog of Louisiana in 1979. The United Kennel Club was the first national dog registry to recognize the Catahoula, in 1995. The Catahoula entered the American Kennel Club"s Foundation Stock Service, which maintains records for rare breeds, in 1996. It has not yet met the requirements for AKC recognition and may not participate in AKC conformation events. The Catahoula is a unique dog with a fascinating heritage and strong working ability. It is not suited for life with every family, but when you make a commitment to one and form a bond with him, you have a steadfast protector and companion for life.
Males, 22 to 26 inches at the shoulder and 65 to 90 pounds; females, 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and 50 to 65 pounds.
The proper Catahoula is not aggressive toward people. He is wary of strangers but never shy. With family members, he is loving and protective. Males can be aggressive toward other male dogs, and Catahoulas in general work aggressively, a necessity in rounding up unruly hogs or cattle. Their instinct is to track and herd game, and if that isn"t an option for them, they need some other outlet for their energy. Catahoulas are excellent watchdogs and will bark a warning or otherwise go on alert at the approach of strangers. Treat them firmly but fairly. They do not accept mistreatment or physical abuse. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who"s available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Catahoula needs early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when he"s young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Catahoula puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Catahoulas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Catahoulas will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. In Catahoulas, look for health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy. The following problems may occur in the breed: Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Deafness: Because Catahoulas carry the gene for merle coloration, which is linked to deafness, unilateral (one-sided) and bilateral (both sides) hearing loss is also a concern in the breed. Before purchasing, test a puppy"s hearing by standing behind it and clapping your hands or making some other unexpected noise and see if it responds. You can also have the dog"s hearing tested at a BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) facility recommended by your veterinarian.
The Catahoula is not a dog that can be tied out in the yard and left on his own. He needs companionship and exercise and should be as familiar with the inside of your home as the yard. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Catahoula will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities. Begin training the day you bring your Catahoula puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he needs a strong leader. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Catahoula. Let him know what you expect, and then let him go to work. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog"s self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Catahoula is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself. If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Catahoula. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your Catahoula puppy from chewing on things he shouldn"t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren"t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Catahoula will be a strong puller. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Catahoula"s safety. He has a strong prey drive, so never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals. Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your Catahoula to be friendly toward or at least tolerate other animals, especially other dogs. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn"t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events, and introduce him to as many people as possible, both in your home and in public With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Catahoula will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 3 3/8 to 5 1/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Catahoula in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Catahoula, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Catahoula"s short to medium-length single coat lies close to the body. Its texture may range from smooth to coarse. Catahoulas are found in many coat colors and patterns. They may have color points, or trim, located on the chest, cheeks, above the eyes, or on the legs, underbody or under the tail. The leopard pattern has a base color with contrasting spots of one or more other colors. Solids have a single coat color. Brindles may have a light or dark base coat color with contrasting stripes. Catahoulas with a patchwork coat may or may not have one predominant solid color with one or more different size patches of different colors and shades placed randomly on the body. Rich, deep colors are preferable to the lighter colors, but no coat color or pattern is more valuable than another. A weekly brushing keeps the Catahoula"s coat clean and shiny and helps reduce shedding. The coat sheds lightly to moderately year-round. A bath is usually necessary only a couple of times a year. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Catahoula"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don"t get caught in the carpet and tear Check the ears weekly to make sure there"s no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog"s breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don"t stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Begin accustoming your Catahoula to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Some breeders describe the Catahoula as a great babysitter for kids. The Catahoula is suitable for families with children, but despite his family loyalty and protectiveness, he should always be supervised in the presence of toddlers or young children. He can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock small children down. And like any dog, he may mistake children at eye level as attempting to challenge him. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any mouthing, biting, or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating and not to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Some Catahoulas get along well with other dogs and cats when they"re raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the company of another dog. To ensure the best relationship, choose a dog of the opposite sex. Make introductions in a neutral area away from your home.

The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a loyal guardian to the core. These dogs were bred to help shepherds in the Caucasus Mountain region keep their flocks safe from predators like wolves and bears. They often use these instincts in modern times to act as watchdogs and protectors, though they are sometimes overly apprehensive around strangers and don"t take well to other animals entering their territory, including other dogs. Smart but headstrong, the massive Caucasian Shepherd Dog needs an experienced trainer that can handle an independent attitude with firm boundaries and patience. They are not high energy dogs, but their size demands space, making them ill-suited for apartment life. A yard with a solid, high fence is ideal. Although they aren"t known for barking more than most dogs, they will alert owners to any dangers, even in the middle of the night, and their bark is quite loud. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can make excellent family companions and should be indoors with their humans as much as possible. They should not be chained up outside, as this is a recipe for creating an aggressive, dangerous dog. With proper training, they can make loving family pets and guardians, and some have even been trained as therapy dogs.
The Caucasus Mountain region is vast, and shepherds in the area had different needs, resulting in several variants of the breed that were created to provide whatever shepherds required. However, the Caucasian Shepherd Dogs from Georgia are generally considered to be the breed standard by most kennel clubs. Female Caucasian Shepherd Dogs only give birth once a year. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are fierce guardians of their territory, but they are also fairly low-energy dogs. Weight gain is a strong possibility and should be addressed with proper diet and exercise. The communist USSR used this breed to guard prisoners and kept dogs in army kennels to create new breeds for military use. East Germany used Caucasian Shepherd Dogs to patrol the border created by the Berlin Wall. When the wall came down, dogs were given to German families to live out the rest of their days. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is one of the most ancient Molosser breeds. Some archaeological findings trace them back to Mesopotamia. Caucasian Shepherd Dog coats come in three lengths and a huge variety of colors. They shed quite a bit, but their thick coats keep them warm even in extremely cold weather. While they are naturally standoffish to strangers and don"t take well to other animals, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be very gentle and loving, and some have even become therapy dogs with proper training.
The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is one of the oldest, most ancient Molasser breeds, and the origin of these gigantic, protective dogs is a bit of a mystery. They hail from the Caucasus Mountain region and have been around for more than 2,000 years. Some believe they came from wolves that were domesticated, while others believe their ancestry includes Mastiffs and other breeds. Many experts claim that the Caucasian Shepherd Dog is descended from sheepdogs that migrated from Tibet, but some modern archaeological evidence suggests the breed dates back to Mesopotamia. Wherever they originally came from, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs made invaluable companions to the shepherds of the Caucasus region for centuries. They fiercely guarded flocks of sheep and their owners from dangerous wildlife such as wolves, jackals, and bears. They needed to be fearless, strong, and intimidating while being resilient to cold weather and harsh conditions. Shepherds bred the qualities they needed into their dogs, and because the Caucasus Mountain region is so vast, many different variants of the breed emerged, though the Caucasian Shepherd Dogs that developed in Georgia came to be the breed standard that is recognized by most kennel clubs today. Sometime in the 1900s, the communist USSR started using Caucasian Shepherds as prisoner guard dogs and used them to develop other breeds in army kennels. In the 1960s, East Germany put the breed to work as border patrol dogs along the Berlin Wall. When the wall came down in 1989, some 7,000 patrol dogs were dispersed, and many were given to families in Germany to live out the rest of their days. Today, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are mostly family companions, watchdogs, and property guardians, though they are still used by shepherds to tend to flocks. They have retained many of their cautious, standoffish, and sometimes aggressive traits, so they need early socialization and firm training to avoid incidents. It is likely that breeders will try to weed out some of the less desirable tendencies from the breed as it becomes more popular.
Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are massive. Males tend to be a bit larger than females and weigh in at 110 to 220 pounds, while females average around 100 to 180 pounds. Some dogs may weigh more or less, and this can depend on where they come from or what type they are. Mountain dogs are more muscular, while plain dogs are a bit leaner. Males are about 27 to 30 inches in height at the shoulder, and females are between 25 and 28 inches. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are considered to be a giant breed.
The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is not for novice dog owners. While they are capable of being loving, loyal family dogs and fierce protectors, they are also naturally distrustful of strangers and do not take well to dogs or other animals that they aren"t familiar with. In general, they are low energy and laid back, but they are also highly territorial and never back down from a fight, even if that means taking on a bear or a wolf. Although Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, they can also be quite stubborn, which may make training difficult. They need firm boundaries, patience, and consistency. This training should begin as early in life as possible, and socialization is practically a must. Proper socialization training has to be done to overcome the breed"s apprehension around new people and animals, which can result in aggression. However, with humans they are familiar with, the Caucasian Shepherd is quite loving and loyal and will make for a lifelong guardian and protector.
The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is mostly considered to be a healthy breed, but like many giant breeds, they can be prone to hip dysplasia. They may also develop cataracts. One of the most common problems they face is obesity. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should be fed an appropriate diet for a giant breed, but they do not have overly high energy levels, and that should be taken into consideration. They will need to be exercised, and their weight should be monitored by veterinarians. To prevent obesity in your Caucasian Shepherd Dog, talk to your veterinarian or nutritionist about formulating an appropriate diet and creating an exercise regimen. Your vet may recommend feeding them smaller, more frequent meals during the day rather than large ones to avoid bloat.
The main form of care that Caucasian Shepherd Dogs need is weight control through appropriate diet and exercise. You should discuss these with your veterinarian or nutritionist. Beyond that, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should have their teeth brushed two to three times a week and cleaned professionally as recommended by your vet. Ears should be checked for signs of debris or wax build up at least once a week and cleaned as needed. Failure to do so may result in ear infections. Nails should be clipped as needed to prevent breaking and injury. You may also need to keep an eye out for drool and wipe it away when necessary to avoid getting your home covered in slobber.
Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should be fed a diet formulated for a giant breed with fairly low energy levels. You should ask your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist to help you find the right kind of food and portion size for your individual dog. The appropriate diet will change from puppyhood to adulthood and may be altered depending on medical needs. There is some risk that Caucasian Shepherd Dogs will overeat and gain weight, so make sure you are sticking to the appropriate recommended meal plan. Smaller, more frequent meals may be recommended to prevent dogs from developing bloat, a life-threatening condition.
There are three coat lengths seen in Caucasian Shepherd Dogs--long, medium, and short. The longer the hair, the more pronounced the mane is around their necks and the feathering is around their hind legs and tails. All three lengths of coat are quite thick. They are double-coated, with the undercoat being fine and soft, while the outer coat is coarse and longer. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog can be gray, fawn, red, cream, tan, and even solid white. Coats may also be brindle or have large patches of two or more colors. They often have white markings on the body and a dark "mask" around the face. The thick coat should be brushed at least twice a week to remove loose or dead hairs and prevent matting. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs go through a heavy shed once a year. Bathing and extra brushing can help move this shedding along more quickly. Bathing can be a chore with a dog this size, so it may be wise to just bath them as needed or rely on a professional groomer.
Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be loving family pets that are very loyal, even toward children, but it is very important to begin their socialization training early. It is in their nature to be cautious around strangers, even to the point of aggression at times, and they do not take well to other dogs unless they have been properly socialized. Visiting children will need a calm, proper introduction with known humans present, and Caucasian Shepherds tend to be territorial and aggressive to other dogs unless they have been raised with them. Their natural herding instincts can take over, causing them to be pushy toward children, and they may see rough play from new kids as an attack on their human family member and respond accordingly. Remember, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog was bred to be intimidating and will not hesitate to spring into action to defend their home and family from perceived threats. As with any dog, children should be supervised during play and trained on how to handle animals to avoid incident. Even with a well-trained Caucasian Shepherd, their sheer size may be an issue, and it is important to watch them so play doesn"t get out of hand and result in injury. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs may be best suited to homes with older children and no other pets.

The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a beautiful small dog that undoubtedly is a contender for the title of "top tail-wagger." In fact, among the characteristics that Cavalier breeders strive to attain is a tail in constant motion when this breed is moving. If the characteristic wagging of the Cavalier"s plumy tail doesn"t melt your heart, surely his large, dark round eyes will. Warm and lustrous, with a sweet expression, they hold the power to extract constant petting and unlimited supplies of food from people under their spell. Not surprisingly, this breed can easily become fat, which spoils its lovely lines, so be strong and offer a walk or playtime instead of the potato chips and pizza your Cavalier is angling for. Cavaliers pad through the house on slippered paws, always following in the footsteps of their people. With a Cavalier in residence, you"ll never be alone — not even in the bathroom. Because they"re so attached to their people, they do best when someone is at home during the day to keep them company. They are a housedog and will never thrive in an environment where they"re relegated to the backyard or otherwise ignored. When it comes to training, Cavaliers are generally intelligent and willing to try whatever it is you"d like them to do. Food rewards and positive reinforcement help ensure that training goes smoothly. Cavaliers have a soft personality, so yelling at them is counterproductive and likely to send these sweeties into the sulks or into hiding. Instead, reward them every time you see them doing something you like, whether it"s chewing on a toy instead of your Prada pumps or not barking in response when the dog next door barks. They"ll fall all over themselves to find more things that you like. As with many toy breeds, Cavaliers can have issues with housetraining, but if you keep them on a consistent schedule, with plenty of opportunities to potty outdoors, they can become trustworthy in the home.
Cavaliers have a dependent personality. They love to be with people and shouldn"t be left alone for long periods of time. Your Cavalier will shed, especially in the spring and fall. Regular combing and brushing is required. Because he"s a spaniel at heart, he may try to chase birds, rabbits and other small prey if he isn"t kept on leash or in a fenced yard. Cavaliers may bark when someone comes to your door, but because of their friendly nature, they aren"t good guard dogs. Cavaliers are housedogs and should not live outdoors. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.  
While the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a relatively new breed, recreated less than a century ago, his prototype is the toy spaniel that has existed for centuries as a companion to royalty and nobility. Cavaliers are descended from the same toy spaniels depicted in many 16th, 17th, and 18th century paintings by famous artists such as Van Dyck and Gainsborough. The spaniels in those paintings had flat heads, high-set ears, and longish noses. These little spaniels were great favorites of royal and noble families in England. Mary, Queen of Scots had a toy spaniel who accompanied her as she walked to her beheading, and her grandson, Charles I, and great-grandson, Charles II — who gave their name to the breed — loved the little dogs as well. It"s said that King Charles II, who reigned from 1660 to 1685, never went anywhere without at least two or three of these little spaniels. He even decreed that the spaniels should be allowed in any public place, including the Houses of Parliament. It"s claimed that the decree is still in effect today in England, although no one has tested it recently to see if it"s true. After Charles II"s death, the King Charles Spaniels" popularity waned, and Pugs and other short-faced breeds became the new royal favorites. The King Charles Spaniels were bred with these dogs and eventually developed many of their features, such as the shorter nose and the domed head. There was one stronghold of the King Charles Spaniels that were of the type that King Charles himself had so loved — and that was at Blenheim Palace, the country estate of the Dukes of Marlborough. Here, a strain of red and white Toy Spaniels continued to be bred, which is why Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with this coloration are called Blenheim today. Since there was no standard for the breed and no dog shows yet, the type and size of the toy spaniels bred by the Dukes of Marlborough varied. In the mid-19th century, however, English breeders started holding dog shows and trying to refine different dog breeds. By that time, the toy spaniel was accepted as having a flat face, undershot jaw, domed skull and large, round, front-facing eyes. The King Charles Spaniels depicted in paintings from earlier centuries were almost extinct. In the 1920s, an American named Roswell Eldridge started searching in England for toy spaniels that resembled those in the old paintings. He searched for more than five years, even taking his search to the Crufts Dog Show, where he persuaded the Kennel Club (England"s equivalent to the American Kennel Club) to allow him to offer 25 pounds sterling — a huge sum at the time — for the best dog and best bitch of the type seen in King Charles II"s reign. He offered this prize for five years. In 1928, Miss Mostyn Walker presented a dog named Ann"s Son for evaluation and was awarded the 25-pound prize. Roswell Eldridge didn"t live to see the prize claimed, as he had died just one month before Crufts. Interest in the breed revived, and a breed club was formed. The name Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was chosen to differentiate the breed from the flat-faced King Charles Spaniel (known as the English Toy Spaniel in the United States). The club held its first meeting on the second day of Crufts in 1928 and drew up a breed standard, a written description of how the breed should look. Ann"s Son was presented as an example of the breed, and club members gathered up all of the copies of pictures of the old paintings that had little dogs of this type in them. One thing that all club members agreed upon from the start was that the Cavalier King Charles Spaniels would be kept as natural as possible and trimming and shaping of the dog for the show ring would be discouraged. The Kennel Club was reluctant to recognize the new breed, but finally, in 1945, after years of work by the breeders, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was recognized as a separate breed. In the 1940s, two male Cavaliers were imported into the U.S. from England — Robrull of Veren and Bertie of Rookerynook. It wasn"t until 1952, however, that Cavaliers had their true beginnings in the U.S. In that year, Mrs. (Sally) Lyons Brown of Kentucky was given a black and tan bitch puppy named Psyche of Eyeworth by her English friend, Lady Mary Forwood. She fell in love with the breed and imported more. When she found that she couldn"t register her dogs with the American Kennel Club, she started contacting people in the U.S. that had Cavaliers. At that time, there were fewer than a dozen. In 1954, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, USA (CKCSC, USA), the official breed club and only registering body for Cavaliers in the United States for more than fifty years. During these years, the members of the CKCSC, USA decided against pushing for full recognition of the breed, feeling that the club"s strict code of ethics prevented the breed from being commercially bred. They feared that too much recognition of the breed would lead to it becoming too popular and therefore too attractive for breeders who wouldn"t maintain the standards they had established. Mostly, they kept the AKC Miscellaneous status so that members who wanted to show their dogs in obedience could do so. In 1992, the AKC invited the CKCSC, USA to become the parent club for the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The membership said no. A small group of CKCSC, USA members formed the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club (ACKCSC) and applied to the AKC for parent-club status. This was granted, and the AKC officially recognized the breed was in March 1995. The CKCSC, USA is still an independent breed registry, but the ACKCSC is the parent club for the breed within the AKC.
This small but sturdy dog stands 12 to 13 inches at the shoulder and weighs 13 to 18 pounds. There is no such thing as a "toy" Cavalier, and you would do well to avoid buying a Cavalier from a breeder who offers dogs half that size.
The gregarious Cavalier takes as his role model humorist Will Rogers, who famously said he never met a stranger. The Cavalier is eager to meet everyone who crosses his path, and if that person sits down and offers a lap (or a treat), so much the better. Like any dog, Cavaliers come in a range of personalities, from quiet and sedate to rowdy and rambunctious. They might or might not bark when someone comes to the door, so they"re a poor choice as a watchdog — except, that is, for watching the burglar cart off the silver. There are exceptions, of course — some Cavaliers will inform you of every event in your neighborhood and bark ferociously when strangers approach — but overall you"re better off buying an alarm system than counting on your Cavalier to alert you to trouble.
Cavaliers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cavaliers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Cavaliers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Mitral Valve Disease (MVD): This is a common condition in Cavaliers. It starts with a heart murmur that becomes increasing worse until the dog has heart failure. Heart disease in older dogs of any breed is fairly common, but Cavaliers are prone to developing MVD at an early age, sometimes as young as one or two years old. Research into prevention of this condition is ongoing. Because it appears to have a genetic component, responsible breeders have their breeding dogs evaluated regularly by veterinary cardiologists to try to prevent this condition from continuing to future generations. Syringomyelia (SM): This condition affects the brain and spine and appears to be common in Cavaliers. Symptoms range from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It"s caused by a malformation of the skull, which reduces the space for the brain. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 6 months and 4 years. The first signs you might notice are sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, with the dog sometimes whimpering, or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder, usually just on one side of the body, without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). They may try to scratch even when walking. For this reason, if your Cavalier is scratching, it"s important to take him to the vet to rule out SM. For more information, visit Syringomyelia. Episodic Falling: This condition often is confused with epilepsy, but the dog remains conscious during the falling or seizure. It"s brought about because the dog can"t relax its muscles. Symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling episodes to seizure-like episodes that last for hours. Symptoms usually start before five months but may be noticed only later in life. Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Cavaliers often are able to lead normal, healthy lives. On rare occasions, one may require surgery to lead a normal life. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye): This condition usually is caused by an autoimmune reaction to the dog"s tear glands, leading to a reduction of tears. Once diagnosed, this condition is easily treated by administering drops in the eyes every day. If left untreated, it can result in blindness.
Their size and generally quiet nature make Cavalier King Charles Spaniels good candidates for apartment or condo living. They are moderately active indoors, and a small yard is adequate for their exercise needs. Walks on leash or a securely fenced yard are musts with this breed. They have no street smarts and will run right in front of a car if they catch sight of a bird or other interesting prey. Your Cavalier will enjoy a daily walk or romp in the yard and will tailor his activity level to your own. Because he"s a rather short-nosed breed, avoid walking him during the heat of the day and never leave him out in a hot yard without access to shade or cool, fresh water.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Cavalier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. If you feed a canned or raw diet, it"s a good idea to cover the ears with a snood, or headband, or pull them back with a hair scrunchy while your Cavalier eats. Otherwise, he"ll end up with food in his fur — not a good look. For both water and food, look for bowls with a narrow diameter so the ears don"t drag in them. For more on feeding your Cavalier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Cavaliers are adorned with medium-length coats that are silky to the touch and may be slightly wavy. Adult Cavaliers have feathering on their ears, chest, legs, feet and tail. Cavaliers come in four colors: Blenheim, a rich chestnut on a pearly white background. Some Blenheims have a thumb-shaped chestnut dot on top of the forehead, called a lozenge. Tricolor, black markings on a white coat with tan markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the underside of the tail Black and Tan, black with tan markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, inside the ears, and on the chest, legs and underside of the tail Ruby, a solid rich reddish-brown with no white spots or markings Blenheim is the most common color, but the others aren"t rare. Cavaliers are fairly easy to maintain. You need to comb or brush them three or four times a week and bathe them as necessary. For a dog that enjoys playing outdoors as well as spending a lot of time on your bed or other furniture, that might be weekly. The feathered hair on the ears and legs is prone to tangling, so check those areas frequently for mats that need to be gently combed out. Trim the hair between the pads on the feet and clean your Cavalier"s ears regularly. The only real difficulty is keeping white paws looking pristine instead of dingy. Cavaliers are average shedders. They don"t need any special trimming or clippering; in fact, it"s preferred for the feathering to remain natural, although some people trim the feet for neatness" sake. Others of us like the furry-footed hobbit look. Brush your Cavalier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Cavalier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Cavalier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Cavaliers can be great playmates for kids who will enjoy throwing a ball for them, teaching them tricks, participating in dog sports, or simply having them on a lap while they read or watch television. Because of their small size, however, they should be supervised when playing with small children who might injure them accidentally. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. They get along well with other dogs and can learn to play nice with cats and other pets if introduced to them at an early age. It helps if the cat is willing to stand up for herself because a Cavalier enjoys a good game of chase. They even enjoy it if the cat chases back. Some Cavaliers live peaceably with pet birds while others try to eat them — or at the very least pull their tails. Always supervise your Cavalier"s interactions with birds and other small animals; they can have a strong hunting instinct.
Cavaliers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Cavaliers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Cavalier rescue. Cavalier Rescue USA ACKCS Trust

The result of a cross between a Scottish Terrier and a Sealyham Terrier — with the goal of creating a dog that could go after vermin without getting stuck in their dens — the Cesky (pronounced chess-key) was created in 1948 in what was then Czechoslovakia. Mellower than most terriers, the Cesky needs moderate amounts of exercise. And unlike many terriers, he has the advantage of a soft coat that can be trimmed with clippers rather than requiring hand-stripping (plucking dead hairs by hand). Loving and devoted, he"s also active enough to compete in earthdog trials, agility, obedience, and tracking. The Cesky is also a successful therapy dog. He gets along well with children and other pets, especially if he"s raised with them.

It takes a tough dog to hunt waterfowl in the rough and icy chop of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever--nicknamed the Chessie — was born for these tough conditions. He"s believed to be descended from two Newfoundland puppies — Sailor and Canton--who survived a shipwreck in the area in 1807. They were found to have fine retrieving qualities and were bred to local dogs. The result was this brown dog with a thick, water-shedding coat, a bright and happy disposition, and intelligence and courage. Given their heritage, it"s not surprising that Chessies love water. When introduced to water play at a young age, they become strong, powerful swimmers, using their straight or slightly curved tail as a rudder. Chessies can fill many job descriptions. These sporting pups are prized as superb hunting dogs. They have excellent noses, and their stubborn streak — you knew there had to be a downside, didn"t you? — comes in handy when they are searching for fallen game. There are authenticated stories of Chessies retrieving as many as 100 ducks in a day. With proper training, they do well as hunting companions, in hunt tests, and in the more competitive venue of field trials. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers can also do well in obedience competition if creatively trained to tolerate the repetitive nature of the sport, but rally, flyball, and agility might be better choices for them. And, of course, they"re cherished companions. Chessies are friendly, outgoing, and obedient, although they can have a mind of their own. With their strength and smarts, they can easily overpower an unprepared owner, but for the experienced dog person who can give them the training structure and discipline they need, they can become a willing and hard-working companion. Daily exercise in the form of long walks or opportunities to swim will satisfy his love of activity and ensure that he"s a quiet companion in the home. Like every dog, the Chessie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights and sounds. Even with socialization, his temperament is such that as an adult he isn"t exuberantly friendly with strangers; he tends to be reserved when meeting people for the first time. This characteristic makes him an excellent watchdog who is highly protective of his people and property. On the down side, some Chessies can be aggressive toward other dogs. In both instances, your Chessie must learn to defer to your leadership when it comes to interacting with other people and dogs. Train your Chessie with consistency and positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior. Keep training fun and avoid repetition so he doesn"t become bored. Always end training sessions on a high note, praising or rewarding him for something he"s done well. In other words, quit while you"re both ahead! He learns best from people he knows and loves, so don"t try to take the easy way out by sending him off to a trainer. This loyal dog will work best for you if you train him yourself. The Chessie often has an excellent rapport with children, but he won"t tolerate abuse from them. In most situations, if he doesn"t like the way he"s being treated, he"ll get up and leave the situation if possible. Interactions between small children and any dog should always be supervised. A healthy, temperamentally sound Chessie puppy is active and inquisitive with a glossy coat and pink gums and tongue. Puppies should already be enthusiastically retrieving objects, unperturbed by loud noises, and eager to approach people. They should never seem shy, fearful, or aggressive. With such a good start in life, plus your leadership and training, this serious, sensitive, and strong-minded dog will become a well-loved member of the family.
Chessies require a great deal of exercise, including swimming if possible. If they don"t receive adequate exercise, they can become frustrated and destructive. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are not recommended for inexperienced or first-time dog owners. They can be prone to dominance problems if not properly trained and socialized. You must provide strong leadership without being harsh. Chessies can be more aggressive, willful, and reserved with strangers than other retrievers. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers may be combative toward other dogs. Chessies are strong dogs, slow to mature, with a tendency to be territorial. They need firm training and management. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is one of the few breeds that can claim to be born in the USA. The breed is thought to descend from two Newfoundland dogs named Sailor and Canton who were traveling aboard a ship bound for England in 1807. The ship ran aground, but the crew and the two dogs Sailor, a dingy red male, and Canton, a black female, were rescued. Sailor found a home with John Mercer of West River and Canton with Dr. James Stewart of Sparrow"s Point. Both dogs gained a reputation as excellent water dogs, especially when it came to duck hunting, and their puppies inherited their abilities — and their unusual yellowish or amber-colored eyes. There was no recorded mating of the two dogs, but seventy years later, when strains from both the eastern and western shores of Maryland met at the Poultry & Fanciers Association show in Baltimore in 1877, their similarities were sufficient that they were recognized as one breed, "The Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog." Records show that the offspring of Canton and Sailor were intermingled at the Carroll Island Kennels and spread from there throughout the region. By the time the American Kennel Club was established in 1884, a definite Chesapeake variety had been developed and was well known for its prowess in the rough, icy waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The American Chesapeake Club was formed in 1918. The American Chesapeake Club held the first licensed retriever trial in 1932. Fittingly, the front door of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. Michael"s, Maryland, is guarded by a pair of cast-iron statues of Chessies.
Males stand 23 to 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh 65 to 80 pounds; females 21 to 24 inches and 55 to 70 pounds.
A proper Chessie has a bright and happy disposition combined with courage, intelligence, a strong work ethic, and an alert nature that makes him an excellent watchdog. He"s strongminded, though — read: stubborn — and requires firm, consistent training by all the adults in the household. You can"t let him do something "just this once," or you"ll spend days or weeks retraining him. If you"re providing the right leadership, a sharp look or verbal reprimand is enough to rein in bad behavior; more severe punishment is overkill and will only cause him to become sulky and unresponsive. The Chessie can have a goofy sense of humor, but the entertainment value can be offset by his sometimes obsessive stubbornness. Once he gets an idea into his head, it can be hard to remove. And when he wants something, he will be persistent in going after it. That"s great if you have him retrieving ducks, not so great if he"s bugging you for something else, like a kid in the grocery store who wants candy. Temperament doesn"t occur in a vacuum. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Socialization helps ensure that your Chessie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Chessies are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Chessies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a Chessie. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Epilepsy: Chessies can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Chessie has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Chondrodysplasia: This genetic disorder is commonly mislabeled as "dwarfism." Dogs with the deformity have abnormally short limbs for the breed. It ranges in severity from "nearly normal" to severe crippling. In less severe cases, dogs have lived full and healthy lives but a dog that is diagnosed with chondrodysplasia or screened as a carrier should not be bred so as not to pass on the genes for the condition.
Chesapeake Bay Retrievers like a cool climate. They do best in a warm climate if they have frequent opportunities to swim. Chessies require a great deal of exercise to remain happy, and if they do they"re quiet housedogs who will be happy to relax with you while you watch TV. Give him a minimum of 20 minutes per day of intensive work, training, water retrieves, or play, or up to an hour of a more sedate walk. Chessies love to swim and do well if swimming can be included in their daily exercise regime. They are a country or suburban dog, not a city dog. Puppies have special exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch or let them splash in a kiddie pool. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. Start teaching them how to swim in a pool or lake, weather permitting. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Chessie pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Chessies work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Chessie who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting and make him feel as if he has a choice in what he"s doing. When your Chessie does something inappropriate such as countersurfing or lifting his leg in the house, you must let him know right then and there — loudly and firmly — that his behavior is unacceptable and not to ever be repeated. No exceptions!
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Puppies eat a lot, but err on the side of slenderness to protect their still developing joints. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs, and they should have a visible waist when you look down at them. A four-month-old puppy may eat two cups of adult food or large-breed puppy food twice a day, for a total of four cups. For more on feeding your Chessie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
As befits his purpose as a water retriever, the Chessie has a coat that resists water in the same way that a duck"s feathers do. The top coat is short, thick, harsh, and oily, and the undercoat is fine, dense, and woolly. Together, they provide super insulation, allowing him to hunt in all conditions, including ice and snow. The oily outercoat and woolly undercoat prevent cold water <p>When your Chessie does something inappropriate such as countersurfing or lifting his leg in the house, you must let him know right then and there — loudly and firmly — that his behavior is unacceptable and not to ever be repeated. No exceptions!</p>from reaching his skin and help him to dry quickly. After he leaves the water and shakes, his coat is merely moist because it doesn"t hold water. The Chessie"s coat is meant to help him blend in to his surroundings — canine camouflage, as it were. He can be any shade of brown, sedge, or the dull tan or strawlike color known as deadgrass, a perfectly descriptive term. Deadgrass has no red tones. Deadgrass can vary from almost yellow to tan. Sedge is an almost strawberry blonde coloration with definite reddish undertones on a relatively light-colored coat. Brown is darker and may have red undertones (light brown, brown and dark brown). Occasionally the Chessie may have a white spot on the chest, belly, toes, or back of the feet immediately above the large pad. Like most retriever breeds, Chessies shed heavily. Brush the coat weekly with a rubber curry brush to remove dead hair and distribute the skin oils throughout the coat. Regular brushing will help keep loose hair on the brush and off your clothes and furniture. Avoid using a wire slicker brush or coat rake, which can break down the wave and kink in the hair. Bathe a Chessie as little as possible to avoid stripping out the protective oils and destroying the coat"s water resistance. A warm bath or two during shedding season helps release dead hair, however, so the new coat can grow in.
In general, Chessies love kids but won"t put up with a lot of harassment, instead preferring to walk away. They can, however, be possessive of food and toys, which can make them a poor match for homes with young children. They are protective of children but can misinterpret their play with their friends and react inappropriately. Many breeders won"t sell Chessie puppies to families with children younger than 8 years of age. An adult Chessie who"s familiar with children is a better match for a family with young kids. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Chessies can be aggressive toward strange dogs, but should get along fine with other family dogs and cats if they"re raised with them.

The Chihuahua is a saucy little hot tamale and not just because of his association with a certain fast-food Mexican restaurant. He"s renowned for being the world"s smallest dog, but he may well have the world"s biggest personality stashed inside that tiny body. That larger-than-life persona makes him appealing to men and women alike.Fun loving and busy, Chihuahuas like nothing better than to be close to their people. They follow them everywhere in the house and ride along in tote bags when their people run errands or go shopping. It"s not unusual for Chihuahuas to form a close bond with a single person, and they can become very demanding if they"re overindulged.Besides being affectionate housemates, Chihuahuas are intelligent and fast learners. They can compete in agility and obedience trials with just as much enthusiasm and success as larger dogs. That said, they"re willful little dogs. You"ll be most successful if you can persuade them that competing — or simply doing as you ask — is fun. Use positive reinforcement in the form of praise and food rewards when training your Chihuahua. He won"t respond to harsh treatment.It"s important when considering the Chihuahua to take into account his small size. Chihuahuas are curious and bold explorers. They"ve escaped from yards through small gaps in the fence and can squeeze into places that other puppies and dogs wouldn"t be able to fit. And even though they tend to rule the roost, they can be accidentally injured by rambunctious larger dogs.Chihuahuas are not recommended for homes with children under the age of eight, simply because of the chance of injury by a young child. Regardless of your family situation, it"s important to remember to socialize your Chihuahua to children, adults, and other animals. Chihuahuas are mistrustful of strangers, which makes them good watchdogs, but they need to learn to meet people in a friendly manner. It"s also important to remember that Chihuahuas tend to forget they are small and will stand up to a larger aggressive dog; as a result the Chihuahua needs vigilant supervision in new situations, while they"re on walks, and when they"re in the yard.The Chihuahua"s personality and unique size make him a wonderful go-everywhere companion. People who live with Chihuahuas become devoted to them, and many say that once you share your life with one, there will be no other dog breed for you.
Choose a Chihuahua breeder who provides health clearances for patellas and heart conditions. The Chihuahua is a long-lived breed; expect to care for him for up to 18 years. Chihuahuas are prone to shivering when they are cold, excited, or scared. Provide your Chihuahua with a sweater or coat when he goes outdoors in cold or wet weather. Chihuahuas can be unfriendly toward other dogs if they"re not socialized when young. Chihuahuas don"t back down from other dogs and this can cause a problem if they encounter a large aggressive dog. Don"t leave your Chihuahua unattended in the yard. He could be attacked by a hawk, other birds of prey, or larger dogs or coyotes. Chihuahuas can be reserved with strangers. Choose a puppy that was whelped and raised in a home with a lot of human interaction. Chihuahuas are not the best dog to have when you have young children. Chihuahuas are fragile and a toddler may hurt the dog while playing. Most breeders won"t sell puppies to homes with children younger than eight years. The Chihuahua"s ears can be prone to ear wax build up and dry skin. Chihuahuas are happy as companions, but they do need 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily and can go for much longer than you might expect. Monitor your Chihuahua, especially when he"s a puppy, so that he doesn"t wear himself out. Chihuahuas have larger than life personalities and will run your life if you let them. They can be destructive when bored and can become finicky eaters if their diet is fussed over. Establish ground rules and stick with them or you"ll find yourself giving up your comfortable chair because your beloved pet has told you to move. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
As with so many breeds, the Chihuahua"s origins are unclear, but there are two theories of how he came to be. The first is that he descended from a Central or South American dog known as the Techichi.When we look at the evidence of the Chihuahua coming from Central and South America, we find ourselves looking back to the Toltec civilization. There are Toltec carvings dating to the 9th century C.E. that depict a dog resembling the Chihuahua, with the same large ears and round head. These dogs were called Techichi, and their purpose in Toltec civilization is obscure.When the Aztecs conquered the Toltecs, they absorbed the Techichi into their society. Many of the dogs lived in temples and were used in Aztec rituals. The Aztecs believed that the Techichi had mystic powers, including the ability to see the future, heal the sick, and safely guide the souls of the dead to the underworld. It was customary to kill a red Techichi and cremate him with the remains of the deceased. The Aztecs also used the Techichi as a source of food and pelts. The Spanish conquered the Aztecs in the late 1500s and the Techichi faded into obscurity.The second theory is that small hairless dogs from China were brought to Mexico by Spanish traders and then bred with small native dogs.Regardless of which theory is accurate, the shorthaired Chihuahua we know today was discovered in the 1850s in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, from which he took his name. American visitors to Mexico brought the little dogs home with them. They began to be shown in 1890, and a Chihuahua named Midget became the first of his breed to be registered with the American Kennel Club in 1904. The longhaired variety was probably created through crosses with Papillons or Pomeranians. The breed"s popularity took off in the 1930s and 1940s, when it was associated with dance king and Latin music bandleader Xavier Cugat.Since the 1960s, the Chihuahua has been one of the most popular breeds registered by the AKC. Today they rank 11th among the 155 breeds and varieties the AKC recognizes.
The typical Chihuahua weighs 3 to 6 pounds. There are Chihuahuas that are smaller, but they tend not to be very healthy. Chihuahuas can also be oversize, with some reaching 12 or more pounds. These can be good choices for families with children.
The bold and confident Chihuahua is often described as being terrier-like. His alert nature and suspicion of strangers make him an excellent watchdog. He"s sensitive and thrives on affection and companionship.Chihuahuas often bond to a single person, although they"re usually willing to make friends with new people if properly introduced. Expect them to be a little reserved at first, though. Chihuahuas can be timid if they"re not properly socialized as puppies.Like every dog, Chihuahuas need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Chihuahua puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
The Chihuahua doesn"t have any major health problems, but like all breeds he can be born with or acquire certain conditions. Not all Chihuahuas will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them so you can be informed when you interview breeders and can know what to look for throughout your Chihuahua"s life.Buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Chihuahua possible. A puppy from a reputable Chihuahua breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed, such as luxating patellas (bum knees) and heart disease.Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chihuahuas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for patellas and heart disease. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.The following conditions may affect Chihuahuas: Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a possible problem with all toy breed puppies. [Note: I have left this as toy breed here. There is a difference between toy size and small dogs-the difference, say, between Chihuahuas and yorkies and beagles and mini dachshunds.] Hypoglycemia is easily treatable in the early stages but can be fatal if not treated. It is important that breeders and owners of toy breed puppies recognize the signs and symptoms because this condition can sometimes be misdiagnosed as viral hepatitis or encephalitis by veterinarians. A puppy with hypoglycemia will slow down and become listless, followed by trembling or shivering. Place some honey under his tongue and get him to the vet immediately. If the situation is allowed to continue, he"ll eventually collapse, go into convulsions, fall into a coma, and die. Any time your Chihuahua is limp, with grayish-blue gums and tongue, it"s an emergency. Hypoglycemia occurs in toy puppies when they don"t have the fat reserves to supply adequate glucose in times of stress or when they don"t eat regularly. Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by adisturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They"re an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and five being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets. Pulmonic Stenosis: This congenital heart disease occurs when blood doesn"t flow properly through the heart because the pulmonic valve is malformed, causing an obstruction. This means the heart must work harder and can become enlarged, leading to heart failure. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, there"s little or no obstruction and no treatment is necessary. If the dog is severely affected by the disease, surgery is recommended, but the procedure differs depending on the location of the blockage. Collapsed Trachea: It is not completely understood how this occurs, but the rapid inhalation of air causes the trachea to flatten and makes it difficult for air to enter the lungs, much like a soda straw being drawn on too vigorously. This condition may be inherited; it occurs in certain breeds, and dogs with it show an abnormality in the chemical makeup of their tracheal rings in which the rings lose their stiffness and become unable to retain their circular shape. Hydrocephalus: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can accumulate in the brain because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of trauma during birth, placing pressure on the brain. The head looks swollen or enlarged, but the diagnosis can be confirmed with an ultrasound if necessary. There"s no cure for hydrocephalus, although in mild cases steroids can help reduce fluid pressure. A shunt can also be used to divert fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Puppies with severe cases usually die before they"re four months old, which is a good reason to delay purchasing a Chihuahua until that age. Open Fontanel: Chihuahuas are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby"s will, but sometimes one will not close fully. Treat these dogs gingerly. An accidental blow to the head can kill them. Shivering: Shivering is a common occurrence in Chihuahuas. The mechanics of why they shiver or tremble is unclear but it usually occurs when the dog is excited, stressed, or cold.
Despite the Chihuahua"s small size, like all dogs he needs exercise and training. The amount of energy an adult Chihuahua has can be surprising. He"ll endlessly chase squirrels in the backyard and is willing to play as long as you are. Chihuahuas enjoy walks, supervised romps around the yard, and retrieving toys. They"ll go until they drop, so it"s important to make sure they don"t tire themselves out, especially on hot days.As much as they enjoy playing outdoors, Chihuahuas should never live outside. They aren"t safe from raptors such as hawks, coyotes, or other larger dogs that could go into your yard. They are bred as companions, and the best place for a companion is with you.Training a Chihuahua can be an enjoyable task. They are successful in several different dog sports such as agility and obedience, but puppy kindergarten and basic obedience class are important even for a Chihuahua who"s strictly a companion. Your Chihuahua will meet many different dogs and people in class, contributing to his socialization, and he"ll learn the manners all dogs should know.Chihuahuas are as easy to housetrain as any other breed as long as you take them out frequently and on a consistent schedule. Puppies need to go out as soon as they wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, and just before bedtime. Using a crate to confine them when you"re unable to supervise them will teach them that they can control their bladder and prevent them from having accidents in the house. If they"re not crated, plan to take them out every one to two hours, and don"t crate them for more than two to four hours at a time except overnight.Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Chihuahua doesn"t get into things he shouldn"t. Like every dog, Chihuahuas can be destructive as puppies. They might not do as much damage as a Lab puppy, but those little teeth can definitely leave their mark. Crate training at a young age will also help your Chihuahua accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Chihuahua in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Chihuahuas are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Train your Chihuahua using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cups of high-quality dry food a dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Chihuahua, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Chihuahuas come in two different coat types: smooth and long. The smooth-coated Chihuahua has a smooth, shiny coat that fits close to the body with a ruff of thick, longer hair on the neck. The hair on the head and ears is thinner, and the tail is furry.The long-coated Chihuahua has a soft coat that"s flat or slightly curly. On the body it"s almost as smooth as that of a smooth-coated Chihuahua, but the ears have a fringe of hair, and the plumed tail spreads out like a fan over the back. He also has a ruff on the neck and longer hair called feathering on his feet. The hind legs are also covered with long hair that resembles pants — and that"s what it"s called. On the stomach is longer hair known as a frill.Besides coming in two coat types, Chihuahuas are found in a range of colors and markings. They can be solid colors such as black, white, fawn, chocolate, gray, and silver as well as tricolor (chocolate, black, or blue with tan and white, for instance), brindle, spotted, merle and a variety of other markings. Shades can be very pale to very dark for all the colors.The Chihuahua is a wash-and-go dog. Grooming him takes only a few minutes each week. Brush him weekly with a rubber grooming mitt or a brush with short, natural bristles for a shorthaired Chihuahua and a pin brush for a longhaired Chihuahua. A fine-toothed flea comb helps remove loose or dead hair.Chihuahuas shed small amounts year round and may shed somewhat more heavily — a relative term for a dog this small — in the spring and fall. The longhaired Chihuahua"s undercoat may come out in little clumps. Regular brushing will help keep shedding under control.With regular brushing, a Chihuahua shouldn"t need a bath more than every month or two. Use a shampoo formulated for dogs so you don"t dry out the coat and skin.Ears are an important area to check when you are grooming your Chihuahua. If you smell an odor or see wax, clean the inner ear with a cotton ball, using a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Avoid going into the depth of the ear, past where you can see. If the ears are dry along the edge, rub a little baby or coconut oil onto them.Some Chihuahuas develop tear stains beneath their eyes. You can carefully wipe the eyes to remove discharge, and there are products available to remove the stains.A Chihuahua"s nails grow quickly. Keep them trimmed short. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Chihuahua to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. At the same time, check the pads for any foreign objects or injuries.Like many small breeds, Chihuahuas are prone to poor dental health. Brushing their teeth can help their mouths stay healthy. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Many Chihuahuas love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Chihuahua may leap from a child"s hands and injure himself if he"s not being held correctly, and he won"t hesitate to defend himself if he"s being mistreated. Many breeders won"t sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured. Chihuahuas do best in families with quiet, older children who understand how to interact with them.Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Chihuahua if they"re sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Even if your family doesn"t have children, your Chihuahua should always be exposed to them when he"s young so he won"t be fearful of them if he encounters them later in life. Just be sure you supervise carefully.Chihuahuas get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Chihuahua will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It"s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.
Chihuahuas are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Chihuahuas end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Chihuahua has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they"ve already gone through the destructive puppy stage. Because Chihuahuas have such a long life span, adopting an adult dog can bring you many years of pleasurable companionship.

The Chinese Crested is an exotic-looking small dog who does not actually hail from China. He"s found in two variants: the Hairless, with silky hair on the head (the crest), tail (plume), and feet (socks); and the genetically recessive Powderpuff, who has a full coat. Both variants can be found in a single litter. Regardless of variation, the Crested is a slender, finely boned dog who is elegant and graceful. He"s a beauty, although he tends to win Ugly Dog Contests more often than other competitors. He"s your basic big dog in a small, sometimes naked-looking body. Dog books often describe the Chinese Crested as highly friendly, but that"s actually the exception rather than the rule. Yes, he"s highly likely to smile at you when he"s been naughty, but that"s not quite the same thing. He"s likely to be extremely sensitive and reactive, and he has a high social drive, all of which makes him needy. (Expect yours to sleep under the covers with you.) He can be wonderful with familiar people, but he"s likely to bite strangers unless he"s been well socialized and trained to refrain from this impulse. Contrary to popular opinion, the Hairless does not need to wear sun block, moisturizing lotion, or any other substance applied to the skin at any time; often that just causes problems. The skin has a better chance of staying healthy if nothing is put on it. Cresteds do need to be bathed regularly, however, every one or two weeks. Many of the Hairless types actually have a lot of body hair. Unsurprisingly, most people aren"t prepared for how hairy a Hairless can be, and it can be an issue for allergy sufferers. These dogs aren"t hypoallergenic; they"re just low shedders compared to other breeds — but still, they shed more than you"d think a "hairless" dog would. And even the Hairless has noticeable hair on his head, legs, and tail. Some allergic people are fine with the Hairless variety, while others have no tolerance. This body hair must be kept shaved to keep the skin healthy. Letting it grow out is often excused as a way to keep the dog warm, but the long coat doesn"t perform this function and instead triggers skin problems (sweaters are a better option for warmth). The Crested doesn"t sweat through his skin, and he has the same body temperature as any other breed. Some are prone to a canine equivalent of acne, however. The Hairless Crested is incredibly, unbelievably tolerant of heat. He can lie in 100-degree sun for hours, like a lounge lizard, with no problems. He rarely pants and drinks very little water, which is pretty disconcerting for experienced dog owners who leave lots of water out. Conversely, he has absolutely no tolerance for cold. Some people try to "harden" their Crested by exposing him to cold, as though he were a seedling. This is not only cruel, it doesn"t work. Cold will kill this dog a lot faster than heat will. Take a cautious approach to vaccinations, cortisone drugs, and topical applications with this dog. Rabies shots often trigger reactions. Some Cresteds can have a terrible reaction to medications, including topical flea preventives. A conservative approach to drug therapy is safest, so don"t use anything that is not actually necessary. Normally, they don"t need any flea or tick preventives — they are a last resort for fleas. Cresteds are wonderful family dogs who love to be with the people in their lives. They do well with children, although you should consider the age of the children and how they interact with dogs before bringing this small creature into your heart and home. They can be hurt easily and shouldn"t be left unsupervised with children, or even alone out in the yard. With family members of any age who know how to handle dogs, however, they"ll play games, affectionately cuddle up on the couch, and enjoy an active life. Because they"re so social and needy, Cresteds can suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to barking and destructive habits. They"ll climb and dig to escape confinement if left on their own for too long. When you"re around, they"re comparatively quiet dogs, but they will alarm bark. They do well in apartments and any other type of dwelling. The Chinese Crested is a wonderful family dog who is playful, affectionate, and endearing. He"s a stable companion who fills his owners" lives with love, laughter, and entertainment. Chinese Cresteds are adept at jumping, digging, and climbing. Don"t make the common mistake of underestimating their athletic abilities just because they"re small. They are Houdini Hounds who can escape from virtually any enclosure. A six-foot fence around the yard is a good idea; if they can get a grip on a fence, they"re over it. They have absolutely no fear of climbing or jumping, and they can clear four feet from a standing position. Once they"re out, they move fast and are — how shall we say this — averse to recapture. They are more stubborn than you are. Their athletic abilities are why many Chinese Cresteds are taking the conformation, obedience, and agility worlds by storm. Chinese traders once used the Chinese Crested as ratters on their ships, and they may have served this function in agricultural settings as well. Today they enjoy life as beloved family pets, but they also have the personality to excel at being more than just pampered pooches.
Chinese Cresteds are a small breed suitable for many kinds of dwellings, including apartments. A genetic link exists between dominant hairlessness and missing teeth. It is not a sign of "bad breeding" but simply goes along with the breed. A Chinese Crested should not be left out in the yard alone or be left off-leash on walks. Tiny as he is, large dogs could view him as prey. He can easily escape through fences, and he can jump even high ones. Although Chinese Cresteds do well with children, the age and personality of the children should be taken under consideration before getting a one of these dogs. They can be hurt easily because of their tiny size. The fact that he"s an exotic-looking dog might draw you to a Chinese Crested, but understand that they can be as temperamental as the next dog — and more so than some breeds. They have a stubborn streak. Chinese Cresteds will bark and behave like miniature guard dogs. If you want a quieter breed, look elsewhere. Chinese Cresteds are companion dogs and prefer to be with their owners and families. They cannot be left outside alone and will climb and dig to escape confinement if separated from their owners. They can also suffer from separation anxiety, which may make them destructive when they"re left alone for too long. Proper socialization is necessary for the Chinese Crested since they can become timid and fearful of people. Chinese Cresteds are relatively clean and are low- to nonshedders. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Chinese Crested dogs don"t really come from China. They evolved from African or Mexican (no one is certain which) hairless dogs who were reduced in size by the Chinese. The Crested is believed to have accompanied Chinese sailors on the high seas as early as 1530, hunting vermin during and between times of plague (today they can still be found in port cities worldwide). By the middle of the 19th century, Cresteds began to appear in numerous European paintings and prints. Earlier names of the Crested include Chinese Hairless, the Chinese Edible Dog, the Chinese Ship Dog, and the Chinese Royal Hairless. The Chinese bred the dog for its excellent ratting abilities aboard their ships, and sailors traded them at different ports. Documentation by Europeans of a hairless dog who closely resembled the Chinese Crested appears as early as the 1700s, when European travelers visited Chinese seaports and boarded Chinese trading vessels. The Chinese apparently viewed the Chinese Crested as having magical healing powers; they also used them as living heating pads. They were kept by Chinese emperors as well as by sailors. It"s unclear when the breed officially arrived in North America, but the first breed club here was founded in 1974. In China, the breed has become rare.
The average height for a Chinese Crested is between 11 to 13 inches for both sexes. They generally weigh up to 12 pounds.
Alert and happy, the Crested adores and dotes on his people. Expect kisses and lots of snuggle time in your lap from this happy, loving little guy. Understand that he doesn"t accept strangers easily — but once he comes to love you, you become his world. He makes an excellent companion and is extremely intelligent. Be aware, however, that many dog trainers unfairly rate them low on the intelligence scale because they don"t fit the typical dog personality profile. The Crested is not a good breed for insensitive trainers. The Chinese Crested can be stubborn. Intensely social, he bonds tightly to his immediate pack. Really friendly Cresteds are the exception rather than the rule, as most are naturally suspicious of strangers. He can be reactive, and that trait combined with his high social drive tends to make him needy. He"s wonderful with familiar people but likely to bite strangers unless socialized and trained out of that impulse. He"ll alert bark to protect his home (not that the burglar is going to be terrified). He isn"t particularly yappy, but he is adamant about his guard duty and will do his job. Some also like to howl or sing. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Crested needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Crested puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Cresteds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cresteds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Cresteds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Dental Issues: These tend to crop up due to a genetic link that exists between dominant hairlessness and missing teeth. The Hairless Crested has small, peglike teeth that can slope toward the front of the mouth and cause problems; the Powderpuff has normal toy breed dentition. The Hairless often lose many teeth by the tender age of two or three. Some Hairless require canned food, while others eat kibble with no problem, as does the Powderpuff. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This condition involves the hip joint. If your Crested has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Known as "dry eye," it"s exactly what the name implies: an inflammation and dry eye. It occurs when there"s a deficiency in the water portion of the tear film. The eye becomes dry and the membranes are left with only oil and mucus. The symptoms can be mistaken for conjunctivitis, which also has a gooey yellow discharge. Diagnosis is done with a Schirmer Tear Test. Treatment usually consists of eyedrops and ointment.
A Chinese Crested needs only minimal exercise — he is not a good jogging companion — but mental stimulation is important. There are many toys and puzzles designed for dogs on the market, and he can enjoy many of them. Chinese Cresteds are generally easy to train but they have a stubborn streak, which means you need patience. Positive reinforcement is the only route, and correction needs to be handled sensitively, because the breed can be naturally timid. Socialization is necessary, so if possible find a place that offers separate small-dog puppy classes, so your Crested can socialize with similarly sized dogs. He could be injured while playing with a larger puppy. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Crested doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Crested accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Chinese Crested in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. He"s a people dog, and he isn"t meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel. Crate training is also helpful for housetraining, which can be one difficult area of training for the Chinese Crested (as a group, toy breeds can be tough to housetrain) — but it will all click into place eventually.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Crested in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Crested, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Powderpuff coats are seen in all colors and in combinations of mahogany, blue, lavender, or copper. They can be solid or spotted. The skin tones of the Hairless are pink and black. Perhaps it"s the Hairless"s essential nakedness that made stripper Gypsy Rose Lee a breeder. The Hairless Chinese Crested is bald except for soft, flowing hair on the head, feet, and tail. Hair on the body should be shaved to protect the skin. Don"t use sun block or moisturizers; let the skin remain natural. The Hairless should be bathed frequently with a high-quality shampoo. Because he can be prone to minor skin problems, such as acne, check for any blackheads while grooming. Powderpuff Cresteds are a lot of work to groom. They have a silky double coat, and the undercoat is copious and will mat if the dog isn"t groomed regularly. Shaving the face is an option. The Powderpuff needs to be brushed weekly, except when the puppy hair is changing into adult hair, during which brushing is best done on a daily basis. A pin or bristle brush is best. All mats should be worked out and any "felting" between the pads on the feet should be removed. Powderpuffs should be bathed regularly but not as frequently as the Hairless, and they need a high-quality shampoo to avoid stripping necessary oils from the hair and skin. The dog should be towelled off and blow-dried (on a very low temperature) to prevent him from getting chilled or his coat from getting over dried. Start grooming your Crested at a young age. Grooming allows you the opportunity to bond with your puppy as well as check for any signs of illness that your dog may be showing. Make grooming a positive experience and you will find that veterinary checkups and grooming sessions when the dog has reached maturity will be easy and enjoyable tasks. Most grooming services are available at the local pet groomer"s, and if you"re unsure or wary about doing any of it yourself, especially shaving, you should seek the help of a professional. Both varieties can have dental issues, but the Hairless is particularly prone. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Crested to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Sweet, gentle children are adored by Chinese Crested. Children need to be old enough to understand that they must be careful with these small dogs. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Cresteds love other pets and are playful with them.
Chinese Cresteds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Chinese Cresteds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Crested rescue.

His name means "sand skin," referring to his distinct, bristle-like coat. But that"s not the only thing unusual about the Chinese Shar-Pei. He"s a solid mass of loose wrinkles — folds of skin that make him look like he"s wearing a bulky, oversized suit. His tiny ears sit atop a large, powerful head with a short muzzle and purple tongue. The finishing touch is a thick, round tail that curls over his back. To be sure, the Shar-Pei is an interesting-looking dog, and his looks alone are enough to prompt many would-be owners to choose this breed. But there"s more to the Shar-Pei than his unique appearance. This breed is calm enough that he can live in an apartment. He"s also an independent-thinking, sometimes aloof dog. His heritage as a guardian and fighting dog make him an excellent watchdog and guard dog — so much so that he must be taught not to overreact to people and animals he doesn"t know. Early training is essential for the strong-willed Shar-Pei. He needs an owner who is able to establish leadership firmly and kindly, and he tends not to respect the owner who doesn"t do so. He"s a quick study, so training is generally easy as long as he"s not showing his stubborn streak. Grooming is a cinch with the Shar-Pei. He"s a naturally clean dog and frequent bathing isn"t necessary or recommended. With all those wrinkles, however, he can be prone to skin problems so extra attention and care may be needed in that area. The Shar-Pei isn"t as popular as he used to be, which is actually good for the breed. Increased popularity leads to increased breeding, especially by unscrupulous breeders who breed with no regard for health, temperament, and conformation. Unfortunately, that"s what happened to the Shar-Pei in the 1980s. Responsible breeders have been working to regain the breeds" loyal, loving temperament, and to diminish or eliminate health problems.
The Shar-Pei was once a guard dog and pit fighter. Today he is primarily a companion, though he retains fighting toughness. He can be aggressive toward other dogs or people, so it"s imperative that he be socialized and trained from an early age. Due to his short nose, the Shar-Pei is prone to overheating. Keep him inside with fans or air conditioning during hot summer months. Like other short-nosed breeds, he tends to snore and wheeze, and makes a terrible jogger. Like the Chow, the Shar-Pei has a dark tongue. This is considered normal, even desirable, by dog show enthusiasts. Frequent bathing isn"t necessary for the Shar-Pei, but when you do bathe him, dry him thoroughly. The wrinkles and skin folds are an ideal breeding ground for fungal infections. Though devoted to his family, the Shar-Pei can be willful and stubborn. He must learn right away who the pack leader is or he"s likely to compete for the job. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Chinese Shar-Pei originated in the southern provinces of China where he was valued as a hunter, herder, guardian, and fighter. Some historians believe the Shar-Pei is an ancient breed, though there is no definitive evidence to prove this. Statues that look a lot like the Shar-Pei have been dated to the Han Dynasty (200 B.C.), though these statues also resemble the Chow and Pug. Following the creation of the People"s Republic of China, the dog population in the country was practically wiped out. A few Shar-Peis, however, were bred in Hong Kong and Taiwan. If not for the efforts of one man, Matgo Law, of Down-Homes Kennels in Hong Kong, the Shar-Pei might be extinct. Thanks to him, a small number of Shar-Peis were brought to the United States in 1973 and breed fanciers formed the Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America, Inc., in 1974. The first National Specialty show was held in 1978. The Shar-Pei was accepted in the American Kennel Club Miscellaneous Class in 1988, and recognized by the AKC in 1991 as a member of the Non-Sporting Group.
Males and females stand 18 to 20 inches tall and weigh 40 to 55 pounds.
The Shar-Pei is an alert and independent dog. He is extremely devoted to his family, but aloof with people he doesn"t know. He is said to enjoy the companionship of people more than dogs, and he likes to be with his owner all the time. A calm and confident dog, he seems to develop an intuitive understanding of his owner or family. As devoted as he is, the Shar-Pei is also independent and strong willed. He is protective of his family — making for an excellent guard dog — and will respond to threats. Because he once was used as a pit-fighting dog, he can be aggressive toward other canines. Like every dog, the Shar-Pei needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Shar-Pei puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Shar-Peis are prone to certain health conditions, especially skin conditions. Not all Shar-Peis will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Shar-Pei Fever: Also known as swollen hock syndrome, this condition manifests in the swelling of the hock joint (sometimes both joints), and results in reluctance to move, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and shallow breathing. Dogs have one or more bouts of unexplained fever with temperatures as high as 103 to 107 degrees. The condition usually starts at 18 months, but can appear when the dog is an adult. The fever lasts 24 to 36 hours, and treatment includes reducing fever and pain. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Demodectic Mange: Also known as demodicosis, this is caused by the demodex mite, which a mother dog passes to her pups in their first few days of life. (The mite can"t be passed to humans or to other dogs; only by mother to pups.) Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause problems, but if your Shar-Pei has a weakened or compromised immune system, he can develop demodectic mange. In its localized form, patches of red, scaly, balding skin appear on the head, neck and forelegs. It often clears up on its own, but even so, you should take your dog to the vet to prevent it from turning into the generalized form of demodectic mange, which covers the entire body and causes infection. Seborrhea: This is a condition characterized by flaky skin and a rancid odor. It is usually a secondary condition to allergy, infection, or other disease. Treatment includes bathing in medicated shampoo and treating the underlying disease. Pyoderma: Another skin condition, this is a bacterial infection of the skin, and is fairly common in the Shar-Pei. It can be a primary or secondary infection; the latter results from an underlying condition such as allergy or hypothyroidism. Pyoderma is treated with antibiotics. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Cutaneous Mucinosis: Mucin is the substance in the skin that causes wrinkling. Clear and stringy, it acts like glue when a dog is wounded. Some Shar-Peis have an excess of mucin, however, which causes it to form clear bubbles on the skin that may rupture and ooze. It may be associated with allergies and is treated with steroid therapy. Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops. Entropion: This is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Shar-Peis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Shar-Pei lives comfortably in the city or country. He does well in a limited space, such as an apartment or condo, as long as he gets daily exercise. A backyard is not required, but he does appreciate getting out and stretching his legs. In general, the Shar-Pei is fairly happy just hanging out with his owner, wherever he may be. Begin training and socializing your Sharpei the day you bring him home, and commit to continuing the process all his life. He"ll need the constant reinforcement since he"s not naturally friendly to other dogs. He can also be stubborn and owners must be consistent and firm in order to establish leadership. He is generally eager to please, though, and responsive to training. The best kind of socialization exercise is to take your Shar-Pei with you everywhere — to puppy classes, outdoor events, busy parks, friends" homes — and as often as possible. This will help prevent him from becoming overly shy or overprotective. Since this breed can be aggressive toward other dogs, the Shar-Pei should be kept leashed in public. The Shar-Pei is classified as a short-nosed, or brachycephalic breed, similar to the Bulldog, Boxer, Pug. Their short noses make them highly sensitive to heat, which means they make lousy jogging companions. To prevent heat stroke, these dogs should be kept inside with fans or air conditioning in hot weather.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Shar-Pei, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A quintessential Shar-Pei characteristic second only to his wrinkles is his bristly coat. It stands straight up, like a 1950s butch-style hairdo, and varies in length, from a really short "horse" coat to a longer "brush" coat. You can find it in many colors, including solid black, cream, fawn, red, sable, and blue. He sheds minimally. While the Shar-Pei is a naturally clean dog with very little odor, he needs only a little grooming to keep him looking good. A thorough brushing once a week with a rubber curry or grooming mitt is sufficient to remove dead hair and dirt. He doesn"t need to be bathed a lot, about every 12 weeks if he hasn"t been rolling in the mud. Frequent baths tend to irritate his skin. Brushing and bathing are the easy parts of grooming the Shar-Pei. The difficult, but essential, part is getting him dry after a bath. If you don"t dry the folds and wrinkles completely, you can expect a yeast or fungal infection. Wipe thoroughly between the folds with a dry towel to eliminate all moisture. Brush your Shar-Pei"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Be especially careful with the Shar-Pei"s ears: the canals are small and are prone to irritation and infection. Do not use a swab to clean the ears and take care not to get water in them when bathing. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin getting your Shar-Pei used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Shar-Pei is a devoted family dog who is protective of his family, including children. To best teach him to get along with kids, he should be raised with them; if he doesn"t live with them, he should be exposed to children as he grows up. Because he is such an independent breed, he"s best suited to families with children 10 and older who know how to treat a pet respectfully. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. In order to provide the best chances for getting along with other dogs and animals, the Shar-Pei should be raised with them from an early age. Since he tends to be aggressive with other canines, supervision is essential.
Shar-Peis are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Shar-Peis in need of adoption and or fostering, so consider contacting a rescue group before going to a breeder. Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America National Rescue Trust

It all started with a cross between a farm dog and a husky on Arthur Walden"s New Hampshire farm. The litter of tawny puppies, born on January 17, 1917, included a male who grew up to be big-boned, flop-eared, and handsome, with a gentle nature. He was named Chinook, and he fathered puppies who bore his stamp. Since then, the breed that bears his name has had its ups and downs. It has come close to disappearing several times, but someone has always stepped in to rescue it from the brink of extinction. That"s not surprising when you consider that inside the Chinook"s plain brown wrapper is heart, strength, intelligence, and a mellow sweetness. The Chinook was bred for his pulling ability and stamina. Today, his expedition days are behind him and he"s considered the consummate companion: loving, athletic, and versatile. He"s a great choice if you want a jogging or hiking companion; not so much if you"re looking for a retriever or water dog. And look elsewhere if you want a guard or watchdog. Still, even though he"s not aggressive, his size may be enough to ward off anyone scary. Chinooks are easy to groom, but they shed heavily twice a year, with light to moderate shedding the rest of the time. Avoid them if you"re looking for a dog that might be hypoallergenic. The Chinook is not it. True to their sled dog heritage, some Chinooks can be diggers, excavating a nice spot where they can nap. This is an inborn behavior, so be prepared for your yard to have a cratered appearance. Try getting around it by giving a Chinook his own special place to dig. A Chinook"s vocabulary ranges from silence to woo-woos to excited whining. You may get a quiet one, but more often than not your Chinook will happily share his opinion with you about the day"s goings-on. The Chinook is a rare breed, and you won"t find one just anywhere. Expect to wait as long as six months to two years before a puppy is available, especially if you have your heart set on a particular sex or ear type (floppy or prick ear). Prices generally range from $650 to $1,500.
Chinooks have a gentle, even temperament and are rarely shy or aggressive. Chinooks should live indoors with their people, preferably in a home where they have access to a safely fenced yard. Chinooks can be diggers. Chinooks need 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise. They enjoy hiking, jogging, and pulling, whether what"s behind them is a sled, wagon, or person on skis or skates. Chinooks are smart and learn quickly, but if you"re not consistent in what you ask of them, they"ll take advantage of you. Chinooks are not barkers but can be talkative, whining and "woo-wooing" to express their opinions. Chinooks have thick coats and shed heavily twice a year; the rest of the year they shed small amounts daily. Chinooks need daily brushing to keep their coats clean, but baths are rarely necessary. Chinooks love kids when they"re raised with them, but can be reserved with them otherwise. Never buy a Chinook from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents. Reputable breeders perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don"t pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases. Interview breeders thoroughly, and make sure the puppy"s parents have been screened for genetic diseases pertinent to that breed. Ask breeders about the health issues they"ve encountered in their dogs, and don"t believe a breeder who claims that her dogs never have any health problems. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they"re happy with their Chinook. Doing your homework may save you a lot of heartbreak later.
When Arthur Walden bred a farm dog with a husky on his Wonalancet, New Hampshire farm, he little knew that the result would be a legendary line of sled dogs. Walden, who had been a dog driver in Alaska for a time, brought the sport of sled dog racing to New England. One of the puppies from the aforementioned litter, named Chinook after the warm winds that melt Alaska snows, stood out for his good looks, temperament, and working ability, and his puppies followed in his footprints. When Admiral Byrd was planning his expedition to Antarctica in 1928, he called on Walden and his Chinook dogs for transport. The original Chinook was part of the team. The Byrd expedition was a success, with one terrible exception: Chinook, 12 years old by then, wandered off and was never found. In the famous sled dog"s honor, the name Chinook Trail was given to a portion of Route 113A that led to Chinook"s hometown in New Hampshire. Walden retired after his adventures in Antarctica and passed on the job of taking care of the breed to Milton and Eva Seeley and Julia Lombard. Then Perry and Honey Greene took over, eventually becoming the only people to breed the dogs. Over time, based on their falling numbers, the Chinooks earned the dubious title of world"s rarest breed, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. At one point, only 28 of the dogs remained, and it was then, in 1981, that several people began the attempt to save the breed. They included Neil and Marra Wollpert, Kathy Adams, and Peter Abrahams. They were successful, but Chinooks are still hard to find. They"re recognized by the United Kennel Club and are in the process of seeking recognition by the American Kennel Club.
Males stand 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh an average of 70 pounds. Females stand 21 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh an average of 55 pounds.
The Chinook"s temperament is described as calm, eager to please, and friendly. That said, he"s not necessarily a hail fellow well met kind of dog. He can be dignified and reserved with people he doesn"t know. Females are more likely than males to be independent thinkers. As with every dog, Chinooks need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Another way to help him polish his social skills is to invite visitors over regularly, and take him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors.
Chinooks are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Chinooks will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chinooks, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or PennHIP for hips, as well as certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. Health problems seen in this breed include hip dysplasia, cataracts, seizures, skin and coat problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, potentially causing pain and lameness in one or both rear legs. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. Cataracts usually, but not always, occur in old age and can sometimes be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Seizures: Chinooks have been known to suffer different types of seizures, and research on the problem is being conducted at the University of Missouri School of Veterinary Medicine. Seizures, which often don"t begin until late in life, can sometimes be controlled with medication, but they cannot be cured. Chinooks who have seizures should not be bred. Skin and coat: Some Chinooks can develop dry, itchy skin or hot spots. Gastrointestinal issues: Some Chinooks may develop chronic gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, constipation, or vomiting.
Chinooks love their people and won"t be happy living outdoors away from them. They"re adaptable to most homes as long as their exercise needs are met. These active dogs need half an hour to an hour of daily exercise in the form of long walks and opportunities to run in large, safely enclosed areas. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended for this breed since Chinooks are so determined to get where they want to they"ll ignore any shocks. Train the intelligent and sensitive Chinook with positive reinforcement techniques. He"ll learn quickly if you"re consistent in your expectations. Even more ideal is to work with a trainer to learn how to redirect unwanted behaviors and reward the behaviors you like. Housetraining shouldn"t be a problem as long as you make it a positive experience and provide your pup with a regular potty schedule and plenty of opportunities to go outside. Crate training is a wonderful tool for housetraining and keeping your young puppy from chewing things he shouldn"t.
Recommended daily amount: 3 1/8 to 4 5/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Chinook in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Chinook, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The double-coated Chinook has medium length hair with a thick, soft undercoat and a coarse outer coat. Chinooks who live in warm climates tend to have coats that are less dense than those of Chinooks in colder environments. The Chinook"s tawny coat ranges from light honey to reddish-gold. The dogs may have black markings on the inside corners of the eyes and dark tawny to black markings on the ears and muzzle. Outer hairs on the tail are sometimes black. Some Chinooks have buff markings on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest, breeches, toes, and belly. Daily brushing keeps the Chinook clean and the shedding under control. Be sure to brush all the way down to the skin. The Chinook rarely needs more than a bath or two a year. Trim the thick, fast-growing nails weekly, and brush the teeth at least two or three times a week. Daily is better if you want to prevent periodontal disease and bad breath. Grooming provides you with an excellent opportunity to bond with your dog and to check his overall health. As you brush the coat or teeth, clean his ears and look for sores or other signs of irritation such as redness on the skin, mouth, feet, and ears. Eyes should be free of redness or discharge. Begin getting your Chinook used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
A gentle and friendly Chinook can be a kid"s best friend if they"re brought up together. If your Chinook hasn"t been socialized with kids, introduce the two slowly and calmly so the Chinook can become accustomed to the child at his own speed. Regardless, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Because he was created to be a sled dog, the Chinook is a good team worker and usually gets along with other animals, cats included, but early socialization to other pets is still important. Males who haven"t been neutered may be aggressive toward other males, especially unneutered males.

With his deep-set eyes and large head, accentuated by a mane of hair, the Chow Chow (Chow for short) is an impressive-looking dog. His looks might make you think he"s mean or ill-tempered, but a well-bred and well-raised Chow isn"t aggressive. Instead, it"s said that the Chow combines the nobility of a lion, the drollness of a panda, the appeal of a teddybear, the grace and independence of a cat, and the loyalty and devotion of a dog. He"s also dignified and aloof, as befits a breed that was once kept in imperial Chinese kennels. He"s not really fond of being hugged or fussed over, but he"ll be a quiet, attentive companion to his favorite person, and his loyalty extends to other family members. If he"s raised with children, he"ll accept them willingly, but he"s not the type of dog to tolerate abuse, so he"s best for homes with older kids who know how to treat dogs. If he has lots of positive encounters with strangers during his impressionable puppyhood, he"ll handle strangers with equanimity. This is, however, a highly territorial and protective breed, who"ll give a clear warning to anyone approaching without his person"s welcome. The breed"s most memorable physical feature may be his blue-black tongue. According to Chinese legend, the tongue got its blue hue at the time of creation, when a Chow licked up drops of the color as the sky was being painted. He also stands out for his almost straight rear legs, which give him a stiff, choppy, or stilted gait. He"s not speedy, so he"s not the best choice for a jogger, but he has excellent endurance and can be a good walking companion. When it comes to training, a verbal correction is usually all that"s required to set the Chow Chow straight. No dog should ever be hit, but it"s especially counterproductive with this breed. The fiercely proud and independent Chow will never respond to physical abuse. But earn his respect with firm consistency, and you won"t have any problem training him. If you admire the Chow Chow"s unique appearance and independent spirit, you"ll have a fiercely loyal companion who will be a true treasure in your household.
Chow Chows are very independent and aloof, and they need an owner who appreciates those traits but won"t let the dog take over. Chows should be well socialized — introduced to new people, dogs, and situations beginning in early puppyhood — to ensure that they"re safe and relaxed as adults. Chow Chows may bond with just one person or to their immediate family. They"re suspicious of strangers. Chows need to be brushed two or three times a week to keep their coat in good condition. Chows can live in apartments or condos, so long as they get daily exercise. Because of his deep-set eyes, the Chow Chow has limited peripheral vision; it"s best to approach him from the front. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
Experts have long speculated that the Chow Chow is one of the oldest dog breeds, and genetic testing has proven that to be true. The ancient breed is believed to have originated in Mongolia and Northern China, slowly moving south with the nomadic tribes of Mongolia. Early depictions of dogs resembling the Chow Chow appear in pottery and paintings from the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 22 AD). One Chinese emperor was said to have kept 2,500 pairs of Chows as hunting dogs. In addition to hunting, the dogs were used to guard their owners" possessions. On the down side, their fur was used to trim coats and their flesh was considered a delicacy. In China, the breed went by several names: black-tongue dog (hei shi-tou), wolf dog (lang gou), bear dog (xiang gou), and Canton dog (Guangdong gou). How he became the Chow Chow is an interesting story. British merchants in the late 18th century included some of the bearlike dogs in their cargo. Miscellaneous items, including dogs, were referred to as "chow chow" and the name stuck to the breed. In 1781, the Chow was described in a British book, Natural History and Antiquities of Selbourne, by naturalist Gilbert White. His neighbors had brought home a pair of Chow Chows from Canton (now Guangdong), and he included them in his observations of country life. Fanciers say the breed has changed little since White wrote about them more than 200 years ago. It wasn"t until a century later, however, that Chow Chows were imported on a regular basis. Queen Victoria, who loved dogs, took an interest in the breed, which boosted its popularity. A breed club formed in England in 1895. The first Chow Chow to make an appearance at an American dog show was named Takya, who took third place in the Miscellaneous Class at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1890. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1903, and the first Chow registered with the AKC was named Yen How. Chow Chows were all the rage among the rich and famous during the 1920s. They even made it to the White House, where President Calvin Coolidge and his wife kept Timmy, a red Chow, and Blackberry, a black chow. Analyst Sigmund Freud was also a Chow fan, and his daughter Anna kept and bred the dogs. More recent fans include Martha Stewart; Chows sometimes appear with her on her TV show. Today, Chow Chows rank 64th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
The Chow Chow stands 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder and weighs 40 to 70 pounds.
Some compare the Chow Chow"s disposition to that of a cat: aloof, reserved, independent, dignified, intelligent, and stubborn. Despite his scowl, a good Chow should never be aggressive or shy. Chows tend to mind their own business and don"t usually start trouble. They"ll play with their people, but strangers are of no interest to them unless they"re approaching the Chow"s home without invitation from his owner — in which case he"ll challenge the trespasser. He will, however, let strangers touch him if introduced by one of his owners. A Chow Chow must be extensively socialized — introduced to new people, dogs, and situations — as a puppy if he"s going to be safe and relaxed as an adult.
Chow Chows are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain health conditions. Not all Chows will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chows, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems aren"t common in the breed, but they may occur: Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD) is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Entropion causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Chow Chow has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.
Chows can adapt to a variety of homes, from palaces to apartments. But they should always live indoors with their people, not stuck out in a backyard or kennel. They don"t tolerate heat well, so keep them indoors when the weather is sweltering. Like any dog, an adult Chow Chow needs daily exercise to stay healthy and happy, but not much — he"ll be satisfied with a couple of 15-minute walks daily or one longer walk. A Chow Chow is a homebody who"s not prone to wandering, but you"ll still want a secure fence if you"ve got a yard; it will protect him from traffic and prevent strangers from approaching him when you"re not around to supervise. Chows are easily housetrained, but crate training is strongly recommended. Crates make housetraining easier and keep your Chow from chewing things while you"re away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don"t keep your Chow locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Chow is with you. Chows are more than capable of learning anything you can teach, and a verbal correction is usually all that"s required to set them straight. No dog should ever be hit, but it"s especially counterproductive with this breed. The fiercely proud and independent Chow will never respond to physical abuse. Earn his respect in puppyhood with firm consistency, and you won"t have any problem training him. But if you let the cute pup have his way all the time and then try to train him, you"re sure to face problems.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2 3/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Chow in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Chow, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Chows can have two coat types, rough and smooth. The rough coat, which is what most people are used to seeing, is thick and abundant, standing off from the body like a parka. Beneath that outer coat lies a soft, thick, woolly undercoat. The hair is thicker around the head and neck, forming a ruff, or mane. The tail, which lies over the back, is also thickly furred. The smooth coated Chow Chow has a hard, dense, smooth outer coat with no obvious ruff or feathering (longer hair on the ears, legs, tail, or body). In both types, the coat comes in five colors: red (which can range from light golden to deep mahogany) black, blue, cinnamon (light fawn to deep cinnamon) and cream. These colors may be solid or solid with lighter shadings in the ruff, tail, and feathering. If you"re buying a puppy, don"t be roped into paying more for so-called rare or exotic colors. Some breeders describe their dogs" colors as champagne, silver, lilac, chocolate, or white, but these are just fancy names for the regular colors. There"s no need to pay a premium for them, and reputable breeders won"t try to charge one. Expect to brush your Chow Chow three times a week to keep the coat in good condition and to keep loose hair from landing on your clothes and furniture. Chow Chows are heavy seasonal shedders, and the coat requires extra attention at that time. They have no doggie odor if the coat is brushed often. For brushing, you"ll need a stainless steel Greyhound comb with medium-coarse teeth; a medium-size slicker brush for the legs; a medium pin brush for the longer body coat; and a spray bottle of diluted coat conditioner for misting the coat as you brush. Never brush a dry coat or the hair will break. Brush all the way down to the skin or you"re likely to miss mats and tangles. You"ll probably want to bathe your Chow at least monthly — more often if he plays outside frequently and gets dirty. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Chow"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails as needed, maybe once or twice a month. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent painful, bloody tears. Start grooming your Chow when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
When they"re raised with children, Chow Chows can do well with them, but they"re not a rough and tumble dog that will tolerate a lot of abuse from a young child. Chows do best in families with older children who understand how to treat a dog. As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Chow, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party. Chows who are socialized and trained well can get along with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. They do best, however, with dogs of the opposite sex; they may fight with dogs of the same sex.
Chow Chows are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Chows end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Chow Chow who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

With his large head, low body, and substantial build, the Clumber Spaniel is often described as a dog who plods along with no great speed, agility, or energy, but that description doesn"t do him justice. It"s true that he"s a slow worker, but he has power and endurance, as well as great enthusiasm. He comes alive when he hits bird scent and is painstakingly thorough in exploring it until he either finds his prey or decides to move on. He"s a perfect choice for the hunter who wants to enjoy his sport at a relaxed pace with a dog who will stay close at hand. The Clumber works at a trot and is capable of going all day long at this pace. He wasn"t bred to be a water retriever, but most Clumbers swim well and their heavy coat protects them from cold water. Those used as duck dogs don"t have any problem breaking ice to retrieve their game. This medium-size dog is the heaviest of the spaniel breeds with a long body that helps him move through underbrush. (That long body also gives him a surprisingly far reach when it comes to food on kitchen counters.) He"s characterized by a massive head, dark amber eyes, and a medium-length white coat with lemon or orange markings. Calm and sedate, the Clumber is a sweet and gentle dog who enjoys the company of his people. He bonds to the entire family but sometimes chooses one person as his special favorite. Nicknamed the "retired gentleman"s spaniel," he"s a good choice for first-time dog owners because of his easygoing temperament. The Clumber will adjust his activity level to your needs. His sporting heritage means he enjoys a good walk and can excel in the field or at a variety of dog sports, but he"s also quite fond of hearth and home, especially if he can nap on top of your feet. The Clumber is playful and intelligent, mischievous and stubborn, dignified and charming. A whole host of such adjectives have been applied to this breed, but suffice it to say that he"s a much-loved member of the family who thrives on attention. Children who play ball with him will find him to be a tireless friend. He"s happy to occupy himself by carrying things around in his mouth, a habit he begins in earliest puppyhood and continues throughout his days. It"s not unusual to see him wriggle his whole body as he greets someone, all the while with a favorite toy or other object in his mouth. The Clumber is not an easy-care dog, but neither does he require the same devotion to grooming as, say, a Poodle or Afghan Hound. He does shed, sometimes heavily, and needs daily brushing if you want to keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. Nor is he recommended for the neat at heart. Clumber Spaniels shed, slobber, and track dirt into the house. If any type of mess bothers you, choose a different breed. Clumber Spaniels need daily exercise, which can be satisfied by one 20- or 30-minute walk or a 15- or 20-minute walk or playtime twice a day. While Clumbers make excellent walking companions, they"re not suited to accompanying joggers. The breed has a high incidence of hip dysplasia, and jogging can put unnecessary strain on their joints. Training is fairly easy with this intelligent breed, although there are exceptions to every rule. In general, however, Clumbers respond well to praise and positive reinforcement in the form of food rewards or play. Their gentle dispositions can be easily damaged if they are corrected harshly. Instead, be fair and consistent in what you ask, and reward him every time you see him doing something you like. People who love Clumbers say that once you have one, you"ll never want to be without one. Whether he"s your hunting buddy or a family friend, the Clumber will return your affection and loyalty many times over — and will warm your feet as part of the bargain.
Clumber Spaniels are rare and finding a breeder who has puppies may take time. Expect to spend time on a waiting list. Clumber Spaniels can be destructive whether through boredom or play. Their strong jaws allow them to demolish many household items with ease and they can destroy many so-called indestructible toys. It is important to take this into consideration before purchasing a Clumber and to take the time to dogproof your house. Clumber Spaniels are notorious counter surfers. They may be short, but their long bodies enable them to reach even the deepest of counter spaces. Clumbers can figure out how to break into refrigerators, cupboards, and drawers. Clumber Spaniels are not for neat freaks. They are heavy shedders and require daily grooming to keep their coats healthy and free of dead hair. Even then, you will find their hair in every part of the house. Clumbers slobber. Clumber Spaniels are an excellent breed for first-time dog owners. They are generally an easy breed to care for and are only moderately stubborn. They have a sweet temperament, and their intelligence makes them a wonderful companion. Clumber Spaniels need 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily, broken up into two or three short walks or a single walk. It is very important to maintain your Clumber Spaniel at a healthy weight to avoid stress on his joints. The breed has a high incidence of hip dysplasia and can become obese very easily. Clumber Spaniels do very well in apartments if their exercise needs are met. Clumber Spaniels generally do very well with children and other dogs and animals, but it is still important to properly socialize your puppy to prevent timidity. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The romantic story behind the Clumber"s origin is that the French Duc de Noailles shipped his entire kennel of spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle in England to save his prized dogs during the French Revolution. Little evidence has been found to support this story, however, and a 1788 painting of the Duke of Newcastle — a year before the French Revolution — depicts him with several white and lemon dogs who clearly have the look of today"s Clumber. And the spaniels take their name from the Duke"s estate, Clumber Park, in Nottingham. However they got there, the Duke"s gamekeeper, William Mansell, is credited with shaping the breed as we know it today. The Clumber Park Spaniel was quite popular with noble hunters in the mid-19th century. They even had a royal fan in Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), who kept them at his Sandringham House estate. The first Clumber Spaniel was imported into North America in 1844 by a British officer, Lieutenant Venables, who was stationed in Nova Scotia, Canada. The first American Kennel Club registration of a Clumber Spaniel, Bustler, was in 1878, but the Clumber Spaniel Club of America wasn"t founded until 1972. The Clumber is a rare breed, ranking 121st among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Male Clumbers stand 18 to 20 inches at the shoulder and weigh 70 to 85 pounds; females are 17 to 19 inches and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.
The Clumber personality ranges from reserved and dignified to "I love everyone." In the field they are quiet workers, and you will find them to be quiet at home as well. They will alert you to danger but aren"t indiscriminate barkers. Although they have a reputation for being sweet and gentle, they can also be determined and self-willed. Spaniels like to get their way. And adolescent male Clumbers can be hooligans. They can become pushy and possessive if you don"t establish your leadership early on. Be kind but firm with them, never harsh. That will only make them dig in their paws. Instead, establish clear rules and enforce them so your Clumber knows what you expect. Clumbers can develop bad habits such as counter surfing, fridge raiding, and chewing; in fact, they"re sometimes referred to as Scavenger Spaniels. They"ll steal food from little kids — they probably originated that saying about taking candy from a baby — so crate them while your child is eating. Remember, if they can reach a kitchen counter, they can reach your child"s high chair. Correct these behaviors early — even if they make you laugh — before they become ingrained. Keep food and trash well out of reach, and put child locks on cabinets to keep your Clumber from breaking into the pantry. When you see him chewing on something he shouldn"t, calmly take it away and replace it with a sturdy chew toy. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Clumber needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Clumber puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Clumbers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Clumbers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Clumbers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Because of the breed"s short stature, Clumber hips do not look normal compared to those of other breeds, so a veterinarian looking at their hip x-rays must take that into account. That said, Clumbers have a high incidence of hip dysplasia, so it"s essential for them to maintain a healthy weight to avoid stressing their joints. Your Clumber is highly likely to have hip dysplasia, but if you don"t let him get overweight it probably won"t cause any serious problems. Chondroitin sulfate/glucosamine supplements can be useful in managing any discomfort from hip dysplasia. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Ectropion: This defect is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, usually the lower one, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infections such as conjunctivitis. Severe cases can be treated with surgery. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Clumber has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically, but wait until your Clumber is fully grown. Once his head finishes developing, at two to three years of age, the condition may correct on its own. Ear infections: Clumber Spaniels can be prone to ear infections because their floppy ears trap moisture. The warm, moist environment inside the ear is ideal for bacterial growth. Check ears regularly for signs of infection such as a bad odor, redness, or tenderness. The Clumber with an ear infection may also shake his head frequently or paw at it. Take him to your veterinarian for a diagnosis. Clumbers with frequent ear infections may have food allergies.
Clumber Spaniels can do well in apartments or condos if their low to moderate exercise requirements of a 20- to 30-minute daily walk or playtime are met. That said, don"t forget that they"re essentially a large dog. If you live in a fifth-floor walkup, will you be able to carry your adult Clumber up and down the stairs when he gets sick or too old to climb them? It"s something to think about. Generally, Clumbers are quiet and are not known as a breed that barks a lot. A fenced yard keeps them safe from loss or theft. Besides walks, Clumbers enjoy playing fetch. When they"re puppies, however, it"s important to restrict any running on hard surfaces or jumping on and off furniture or sliding around on slick floors and crashing into the wall. All of those activities can injure their still-developing joints. Your Clumber pup will chase a ball for as long as you"ll let him, even if he"s tired, so it"s up to you to limit his activity. Give him a break after the fifth fetch or so. Crate training is a wonderful tool to help in house training, and a crate also provides a safe haven for your Clumber Spaniel when you are gone. Clumbers are known for their ability to get into things, even as adults, so this ensures that both your dog and your belongings are safe when you are away. Some Clumbers are prone to colitis, inflammation of the large bowel. If your Clumber has soft stools that contain spots of blood or mucus but otherwise appears healthy, he may have colitis. Put him on a 24-hour fast, make sure he has access to plenty of water, then give him bland meals such as chicken and rice for the next couple of days. Gradually reintroduce his normal diet. If colitis recurs frequently, ask your veterinarian about giving your Clumber a diet formulated for dogs with sensitive digestive systems.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies may eat as much as 4 to 6 cups a day. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can"t feel the ribs, he needs less food and a longer walk. For more on feeding your Clumber, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Clumber Spaniel has a soft, medium-length coat that"s thick and straight, lying flat on the body. The ears, legs, and belly have moderate feathering — a longer fringe of hair — and there"s a frill below the neck, longer hair that"s sometimes referred to as an apron. Clumbers are easy to prepare for the show ring because they"re supposed to look natural, with no shaving or trimming except to tidy the feet, rear legs, and tail. Their bodies are primarily white, usually with lemon or orange markings around the eyes and on the head or ears. Sometimes they have freckles on their muzzle — the area of the head in front of the eyes — and on the legs, body, and at the base of the tail. Clumbers who will be show dogs should have as few markings on the body as possible, but freckles and markings on the body don"t affect their ability to be a family friend. Clumber Spaniels are considered to be average to heavy shedders, and there will be days when it seems as if it"s snowing Clumber hair in your home. Daily brushing is a must to keep loose hair to a minimum. Other than that, all you really need to do is trim the hair on their rear legs and tail and between the pads of the feet to keep them looking neat. Ask a breeder or groomer to show you how. A Clumber Spaniel"s white coat can hold a significant amount of dirt and debris, so feel free to bathe him as often as you think necessary. As long as you"re using a shampoo made for dogs, regular baths won"t affect his coat except to make it look clean instead of dingy. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly to prevent itchiness from shampoo residue. Begin accustoming your Clumber to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early. The Clumber Spaniel is prone to ear infections, so preventive care is important. This can be as simple as drying your dog"s ears after swimming and checking the ears regularly for signs of infection such as a bad smell, redness, or tenderness. The Clumber with an ear infection may also shake his head frequently or scratch at his ears. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Brush your Clumber"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Clumber enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.
It"s been said that Clumbers and kids go together like ice cream and cake. Clumbers generally love kids, especially kids who throw a ball for them to fetch. They are usually protective of children in the family and are more likely to walk away than to snap or growl if they"re getting unwanted attention from a child. If your Clumber puppy is raised with your toddler, you"ll probably see a beautiful friendship blossom. The toddler may accidentally get flattened once in a while by an exuberant young Clumber, but he"ll be licked until he"s back on his feet. Nonetheless, dogs are individuals, just like people. Not every Clumber who is raised with kids will take to them, especially if the kids are poorly behaved. Adult Clumbers who haven"t been brought up with kids may do best in families with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Some Clumbers may be reticent around children they don"t know, and like most dogs, they don"t like being charged by tiny toddlers — or anyone else. Protect your dog from these assaults, and teach the children you encounter how to approach a dog safely. Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Clumber Spaniels also do very well with other dogs and animals, especially if they are raised with them. They are birdy, however, and you should protect pet birds until you"re sure your Clumber understands they"re off-limits. Some spaniels can learn that fact, if they"re taught from puppyhood, but don"t assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your Clumber doesn"t pull your parakeet"s tail or your parrot won"t take a bite out of your Clumber"s sensitive nose.

The Cockapoo blazed the trail among planned hybrids; he"s the offspring of the Poodle and the Cocker Spaniel. Also known as the Cockapoodle, Cockerpoo, or Cock-a-Poo, he"s an utterly adorable little dog with a face that could melt a heart of stone. He"s affectionate and accepts everyone — old folks, kids, and other pets. He"s also of an easy size, being small enough to cuddle and big enough to romp with bigger dogs. Cockapoos have an infectious zest for life that spreads to everyone around them, that essential joie de vivre that makes every day a celebration. These guys are just plain happy to be alive. Still, what"s the draw in getting a Cockapoo instead of a Cocker Spaniel or a Poodle? It"s that, in some ways, the Cockapoo represents two ideals: first, what the Cocker Spaniel used to be across the board — a sweet and stable temperament, before the breed"s popularity skyrocketed in the wake of Lady and the Tramp; and second, the Poodle"s orientation to people smooths out the Cockers" orientation to their noses when they"re out in the field. Furthermore, Cockapoos don"t require the level of grooming that Poodles do, and people don"t automatically react as negatively as they do to a Poodle"s extravagant grooming style for showing in conformation. (While it"s not fair to dislike the intelligent and jovial Poodle because of a show cut, the Poodle"s mostly undeserved reputation of high maintenance is pervasive.) Of course, there"s a world of difference between an intentional breeding of carefully selected Cocker Spaniels and Poodles versus a Poodle mix who"s just called a Cockapoo because no one has any clue what his background really is. The true Cockapoo been bred with the goal of a healthy, hypoallergenic dog with a good temperament. Cockapoo breeders feel that the dog"s health and temperament are far more important than appearance, and that"s what they continue to strive for (but nevertheless, the Cockapoo tends to be an adorable-looking fellow). You won"t find many, if any, discussions among these breeders about head shape and height. When the cross works as intended, you get the intelligence and spirit of the Poodle with the sturdiness and field spirit of the Cocker. Of course, when the cross doesn"t work, you can get a submissive, urinating fear-biter — but that can happen in any mixed breed, and in any purebred with unhappy genes. Generally, the Cocker Spaniel used to create the Cockapoo is an American Cocker Spaniel, but some are the offspring of Poodles and English Cocker Spaniels; the latter is often called a Spoodle. Efforts have been made over the last decade to clearly separate Cockapoos and Spoodles into two different hybrids, and some success has been achieved. If the type of Cocker involved is important to you, be sure to ask. But all that is neither here nor there for the Cockapoo enthusiast, who just wants to hang out with a sweet, cute, attached dog who isn"t quite the barnacle a Toy Poodle can be, and who began as a sparkle in the eye of a Cocker Spaniel with a lovely, even temperament.
The Cockapoo is not known to be a barker. Some, however, will bark when they see someone approaching their house, or when they"re left alone for long periods at a time. The Cockapoo should be a nonshedding dog with little doggy odor to the skin and coat. He requires daily brushings and will need his hair trimmed and clipped occasionally. Cockapoos are usually good for people with allergies since they produce low amounts of dander and hair. Cockapoos were developed to be companion dogs and are usually friendly and extraordinarily happy. They can do well with other dogs, pets, and children; older, more considerate children are generally best, however. Although the Standard or Maxi Cockapoo doesn"t adapt as readily to apartment life as his smaller cohorts do, he can do well if exercised properly. The ideal situation is a house with a small, fenced yard. The Cockapoo is so intelligent that he"s easy to train with positive reinforcement. Cockapoos have a moderate energy level but still need daily exercise. Expect to give him at least 15 minutes per day and offer a variety of activities, such as games of fetch, walks, and good runs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. There are many responsible Cockapoo breeders, and some are registered with either the Cockapoo Club of America or the North American Cockapoo Registry. Designer dogs, also called hybrids, aren"t true breeds — they"re crosses of two specific breeds. If you"re interested in a Cockapoo puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren"t as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don"t know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.
When it comes to designer dogs, the Cockapoo is an old hybrid, popular since the 1960s. The first breeding may have been accidental, but the happy result was a litter of puppies who were intelligent, almost odorless, had the low-shedding Poodle coat, and showed the easygoing and loving nature of the Cocker Spaniel. These puppies were well received, and the Cockapoo line began. Some efforts are being made today to establish breed standards and start the Cockapoo on the hard road of becoming a true breed, one producing offspring with consistent traits. They"re one of the few designer breeds who aren"t owner-surrendered at high rates, even now, and many fanciers of the breed attribute that desirable circumstance to the Cockapoo"s intelligence and his sweet and loving disposition. He"s become a highly prized family dog. Once the Cockapoo became more well-known, he only grew in popularity. Some Cockapoo breeders want to make the Cockapoo a purebred dog and use multigeneration crossing, while other breeders prefer the basic Poodle/Cocker cross. There are Cockapoo clubs, but they"re unaffiliated because of these differing philosophies. The Cockapoo Club of America formed in 1999 and, in an effort to create breeding consistency, it created a breed standard. The club promotes breeding multigenerational Cockapoos to each other as opposed to creating new first generations, because this technique is supposed to help puppies maintain the desired qualities that aren"t seen in all first-generation dogs. The American Cockapoo Club was formed in 2004; these members don"t mix generations and don"t breed a Cockapoo back to a Poodle or a Cocker Spaniel. They too have a breed standard, and their goal is "to see genuine Cockapoos bred with lines that can be traced back to their originating roots of AKC/CKC Cocker Spaniels and AKC/CKC Poodles." The North American Cockapoo Registry is also working to establish the Cockapoo as a viable breed. This group formed in 1999 and provides certification for Cockapoos who are the results of first- through sixth-generation breedings. The Registry stipulates that "a true Cockapoo is ONLY a purposeful, planned crossing of a purebred Cocker Spaniel with a purebred Poodle." Breeding philosophies aside, the Cockapoo"s popularity hasn"t just held steady — it has increased over the decades. With the help of responsible breeders and national organizations and clubs, the Cockapoo, in one form or another, could be on his way to becoming much more than a "designer breed."
The Cockapoo is bred in four different size categories: The Teacup Toy is less than 6 pounds in weight and less than 10 inches in height. The Toy Cockapoo can reach 10 inches in height but has a sturdier build, the bigger ones tipping the scales at just under 12 pounds. The Miniature Cockapoo weighs 13 to 18 pounds and ranges between 11 and 14 inches high. The Standard or Maxi Cockapoo should weigh more than 19 pounds and be at least 15 inches in height.
Intelligent and easy to please, the Cockapoo was established as a companion dog. He"s friendly and happy, happy, happy. He has an outgoing nature and usually gets along with everyone. Depending on his temperament, he can be active or he can simply enjoy snuggling up on the couch with you. He has the intelligence of his Poodle forebears but also the sweet disposition of his Cocker Spaniel ancestry. If the parents don"t have the loving quality that is expected in a Cockapoo, then their offspring won"t either. Like every dog, the Cockapoo needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Cockapoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. He prefers, always, to be with his family and can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for too long. He can be easy to train, though that"s dependent on the parents" temperament. Positive reinforcement is the best way to train a Cockapoo; he can achieve high levels of obedience with time and patience.
The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you"re looking for a Cockapoo. Hybrid vigor isn"t necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it"s the opposite of inbreeding. However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won"t have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from an unrelated line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they"re purebred. Not all Cockapoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Cockapoo is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Liver Disease: This condition is becoming more prevalent in Cocker Spaniels in two forms: chronic active hepatitis and copper toxicosis (poisoning). Both conditions may or may not be genetic; at this point no one is certain. More research is needed, but meanwhile ask your Cockapoo breeder about the parent Cocker"s liver history. Ear Infections: These afflictions may plague the Cockapoo because of his floppy Cocker ears, which can trap moisture, dirt, and debris. The Cockapoo"s ears should be regularly checked and cleaned. Ask your veterinarian about appropriate ear care products. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Cockapoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.
Most Cockapoos have a moderate level of energy, but that doesn"t mean they"ll laze around all day. They enjoy a good walk — and need it to keep them from becoming overweight. The best type of exercise, though, is a good play session in the backyard. Expect him to need at least 15 minutes of exercise every day. The Cockapoo is an adaptable breed. He can live in an apartment, though the smaller varieties seem to do better there than do the Maxi or Standard Cockapoos. None of them should live outdoors or in kennels, since they"ve been bred to be companion dogs. They thrive when with their family and can suffer from separation anxiety when left for long periods of time — and that can lead to excessive barking and to destructive behavior. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Cockapoo doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will also help your Cockapoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Don"t stick your Cockapoo in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night (although he would much prefer your bed). Cockapoos are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Cockapoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Cockapoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Cockapoo has a single, long coat that can range from straight to loose curls, but it shouldn"t be kinky. Cockapoos can be found in all the colors and color combinations that are seen in both Cocker Spaniels and Poodles — a more rich variety of coat colors than is usual in many other breeds. The Cockapoo is usually seen au naturel, but many people like to clip the coat. However, it should only be trimmed to two to three inches in length. Hair around the eyes should be trimmed to allow visibility, so he"s not doing an impression of an Old English Sheepdog. The coat should be brushed daily. Although it"s different for every Cockapoo, a puppy resulting from a multigenerational breeding is supposed to be odorless and nonshedding (although "nonshedding" is a fantasy, since every dog on the planet sheds at least a tiny bit). To retain coat oils and health, he only need be bathed when absolutely necessary. Because his floppy Cocker ears block air circulation, the ears must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. (Don"t stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal, because that could damage it.) Your Cockapoo may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Cockapoo"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Begin accustoming your Cockapoo to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Cockapoo does well with youngsters, although he generally prefers homes with older, more considerate children. He also gets along with other dogs and pets. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.

The smallest member of the American Kennel Club Sporting Group, the Cocker Spaniel is the darling of many U.S. pet owners. Remember the female lead in Lady and the Tramp? It"s no accident that the movie"s model of an affectionate and pampered pet was a Cocker Spaniel. From the late 1930s to the 1950s, the Cocker was the number-one breed registered with the AKC. Then his popularity declined for almost 30 years, but he shot to the top of the charts again during the mid-1980s, and only in 1992 was his number-one status taken over by Labrador and Golden Retrievers. Today, the Cocker remains within the top 15 registered breeds. And no wonder — a well-bred Cocker Spaniel is a pleasure to own. He is known for a merry, sound temperament. His flowing coat is extremely handsome, he"s loving and gentle, and he wants nothing more than to make his family happy. Compared to other dogs in the Sporting Group, the Cocker is small (20 to 30 pounds), fitting comfortably into an apartment, condo, or a small home. He is primarily a companion but is easily trained for the conformation show ring, obedience and agility competitions, and field work. He is also an excellent therapy dog. The Cocker Spaniel resembles the English Cocker Spaniel, one of his peers in Sporting Group, and formerly the two breeds were considered one. However, a number of Spaniel fanciers noticed the different strains of Cocker and sought to preserve separate breeds and discourage the interbreeding of the English and American varieties. The American Kennel Club recognized the two breeds as separate in 1946. The typical Cocker Spaniel is gentle, a loving and trustworthy family companion who is good with children, other pets, and the elderly. Unfortunately, his extreme popularity leaves him open to the bane of all favorite breeds: unscrupulous people who breed with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation. As a result, some Cocker Spaniels have serious health and temperament problems. If you are considering a Cocker Spaniel, you must be extremely careful from whom you buy or adopt a puppy. Buy only from a reputable breeder. Never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Reputable breeders breed with temperament in mind and perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don"t pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases.
Because Cockers are so popular, it is especially careful to research breeders and find one who is dedicated to improving the breed. The sensitive Cocker Spaniel can be a bit nervous, even when he"s from a good breeder and has been properly socialized. Don"t be surprised if your Cocker exhibits submissive urination (peeing when excited). Cockers can be barkers, so response to a "Quiet" command should always be part of this dog"s repertoire. The Cocker is eager to please and likes to be close to his family. But remember, he was bred to be a hunting dog. Don"t be surprised when he chases birds or other small animals when you"re out on a walk. Keep your Cocker on a leash whenever you aren"t in a fenced area. The Cocker has a "soft" personality. Harsh training methods will make him fearful, so be sure to use gentle, consistent training to get the best results. A Cocker Spaniel"s long ears are both a part of his beauty and a potential health problem. Be sure to check your Cocker"s ears every week for infections. Keeping the Cocker coat beautiful is expensive and a lot of work. Plan on paying a professional groomer and on brushing the coat every day. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
The modern Cocker Spaniel is descended from the Spaniel family, a large group that dates to antiquity. The word spaniel means "Spanish dog," and it"s generally believed that they indeed originated in Spain. By the 1800s, Spaniels were divided into two groups: toys (primarily companions) and large hunting dogs. Hunting dogs were further divided into land and water spaniels. The Cocker Spaniel was named so for his excellence in the field hunting woodcock. In England, spaniels were a functional category, rather than an individual breed of dog, for several hundred years. The first kennel to gain recognition for the Cocker Spaniel as a distinct breed in England was the Obo Kennel of Mr. James Farrow. In 1892, the Cocker Spaniel was recognized as a breed in England. Shortly before, in the late 1870s, American fanciers began importing English Cockers to the United States. A liver-and-white Cocker Spaniel named Captain was registered in the first studbook of the National American Kennel Club (later called the American Kennel Club). The second volume of the studbook, printed in 1885, registers a black Cocker named Brush II. This dog was imported from England by Commings Cocker Spaniel Kennel of New Hampshire. Right around this time, in 1881, Clinton Wilmerding and James Watson formed the American Spaniel Club. The oldest breed club in America, it originally included breeders of many types of Spaniels. Eventually, however, breeders split off into separate organizations as differences among the Spaniel breeds were refined. Cocker Spaniels quickly gained popularity both with breeders and the public. In time, some breeders started favoring a smaller type of Cocker Spaniel with a slightly different conformation than the original English Cocker. These smaller dogs were especially flashy in the show ring. In 1936, a group of English Cocker breeders formed a specialty club known as the English Cocker Spaniel Club of America, and they gained recognition from the AKC for an English type of the Cocker Spaniel. Two years later, to strengthen its position, the club passed a motion that English Cocker Spaniels should not be bred to American-type Cocker Spaniels. The club also resolved to oppose the showing of American-type Cockers in English Cocker classes. In 1939, a Cocker Spaniel named CH My Own Brucie won the Best American Bred in Show at the prestigious Westminster Dog Show, a feat that he repeated the following year. Brucie, a black Cocker Spaniel, won the hearts of the American public, clinching his popularity in the 1940 show when, as his owner/handler removed Brucie"s leash as they entered the ring, the little dog gaited proudly along his side, wagging his tail. Brucie was so beloved that when he died, The New York Times published his obituary. Brucie"s success in the show ring led to a spectacular rise in the popularity of Cocker Spaniels. It also encouraged American breeders to concentrate more on breeding for the show ring than for the field, further widening the gap between American and English Cockers. In 1946, the American Kennel Club recognized the American Cocker Spaniel and the English Cocker Spaniel as two distinct breeds.
Males stand 15 inches tall, females 14 inches tall. Males and females weigh 24 to 28 pounds.
The well-bred Cocker Spaniel has a sweet temperament. He is affectionate and cuddly and loves to participate in family activites. He is playful, alert, and active, enjoying any exercise from a brisk walk to hunting in the field. The Cocker is known to be a sensitive dog, mentally and physically. He has a "soft" personality and does not respond well to harsh treatment, sometimes turning to growling or snapping when he"s in pain or afraid. Early socialization and training is essential to teach the Cocker appropriate canine manners. He needs to be handled carefully and kindly to bring out the best in his personality.
Cockers are generally healthy, but, like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Eye problems can strike the Cocker in a number of ways, including progressive retinal atrophy, a degenerative disease of the retinal cells that progresses to blindness; cataracts, a cloudy film that forms over the eye; glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside of the eyeball; and eye abnormalities. If you notice any redness in your Cocker"s eyes, or if he starts rubbing his face a lot, take him to the vet for a checkup. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a condition in which a dog"s immune system attacks its own blood cells. Symptoms include pale gums, fatigue, and sometimes jaundice. A swollen abdomen is also indicative, since it signals an enlarged liver. Most affected Cockers do well with treatment, but they should not be bred. Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland that"s thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Primary seborrhea is a skin problem caused by overproduction of skin cells, including the sebaceous (oil) cells. The skin becomes greasy and scaly and has a foul odor. Treatments include medication and medicated baths. Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and Cockers can be especially prone to them. The three main types are food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Idiopathic epilepsy is often inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your dog has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup. Canine hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Patellar luxation involves dislocation (luxation) of the kneecap (patella). In this condition the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling.
The Cocker Spaniel is well suited to living in an apartment or condo — though of course he loves to share a house and yard. Although he doesn"t need vast space to roam, he does need daily activity. A daily romp in the yard along with a brisk 30-minute walk can keep him happy and trim. Then bring him inside with you — the Cocker is not pleased to be left alone outdoors for the day, and he may respond by digging or barking to keep himself amused. He"s most content when he"s with his family, participating in the group"s activities. Despite his beautiful locks and cute, round eyes, the Cocker Spaniel is a hunter at heart. He is also a good candidate for many canine sports, especially agility and obedience competitions, hunt tests, flyball, or tracking. Like most dogs, the Cocker is better behaved when active than when he"s allowed to get bored, which can lead to such behavior problems as barking, digging, and chewing.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day The Cocker Spaniel has a hearty appetite, and he will overeat if given the chance. He"s especially skilled at melting your resolve with his big, brown eyes as he begs for tidbits. But don"t give in — an overweight Cocker is an unhealthy Cocker. For more on feeding your Cocker Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.
There are few breeds as handsome as the well-groomed Cocker Spaniel. His thick, sometimes wavy coat is short on the head and back and long on the ears, chest, belly, and legs. The coat is a solid color (black or light cream to red to brown), or parti-color (two or more colors, one of which is white). Grooming is an intense — and potentially expensive — proposition for the Cocker Spaniel. Most owners opt to have a professional groomer bathe, brush, and trim their dogs" coats every six to eight weeks, and prices are high for this time-intensive breed. Daily brushing at home is also necessary to keep the coat free of tangles and mats. If you are hesitant about a breed that requires substantial grooming, the Cocker is not for you. Some owners opt to clip the coat short to make care easier. Even so, trimming and bathing every six to eight weeks is necessary to keep the Cocker clean and the coat short. The Cocker Spaniel must be introduced to grooming early so he will grow up to accept it as a normal part of his life. Given his sensitive personality, an early introduction is advisable so that he learns to accept the handling, brushing, noise of electric clippers, scissoring, ear cleaning, and all the rest of the tasks involved in keeping him looking good. Unfortunately, the Cocker has a reputation with groomers (and veterinarians) as being less than cooperative. This touchy attitude usually stems from lack of training to accept handling. Positive, kind lessons on how to act on the grooming table or at the veterinarian"s office are needed. The nails need to be trimmed once a month (or at grooming sessions), and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. The Cocker Spaniel is prone to ear infections, so it"s essential to be vigilant. Wipe the ears out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. It also helps to use deep, narrow bowls to for the Cocker"s food and water. This way he can eat and drink without getting his ears damp or soiled with food. Some owners even put a snood on the Cocker while he eats, for extra ear protection.
One of the reasons the Cocker Spaniel is so popular is that he makes a good family dog. He gets along well with children — as long as he is raised with them and the kids are kind and respectful to animals. But because he is a sensitive dog, all interactions between the Cocker and children should be supervised by a responsible adult. The Cocker Spaniel also gets along with other family pets (given proper training and introductions), including dogs, cats, and small animals.

In the 1950s television series Lassie, you knew that the Collie would come to the rescue, whether Timmy was trapped in an abandoned mine or had fallen into a well. After all, the star of this long-running show wasn"t just any dog. She was Lassie, a Collie dog. To be sure, the adventures of Timmy and Lassie are fun to watch. But they"re fiction — aren"t they? Well, according to those who know and love the Collie breed, the fictional accounts of television Lassie aren"t too far off the mark. The real-life Collie is an extremely intelligent, sensitive dog who is known for her uncanny ability to know when something is wrong. True stories abound about this breed coming to the rescue of people and animals. Heroics aside, the Collie is a medium-size (50 to 70 pounds) dog, easy to train, devoted to and protective of her family, and friendly with people outside the family circle as well. Known for being playful and gentle, she makes an excellent companion for children. Although the Collie is good-natured and friendly, she can be suspicious of strangers, especially if they approach the children in her family. She"s a good watchdog — she will bark — but she is not aggressive. The beautiful Collie has two distinct looks: full coat (known as the Rough variety) and short coat (known as the Smooth variety). The television star was a Rough Collie, as was the star of the 1943 movie Lassie Come Home, which inspired the television series. Today, the Collie is more likely to be a pampered pet than an all-around farm dog. She adapts well to a variety of home environments, as long as she has plenty of daily exercise. She enjoys relaxing around the house with her family, as well as running and playing outside with the kids. Her herding instincts are still strong, so it"s not unusual for the Collie to gather children and pets, chase cars, and bark. In addition to her herding ability, the loyal Collie excels as an assistance or therapy dog. She also does well at such canine sports as herding trials, agility, obedience, and lure coursing. The movie and the television series made the Collie a popular dog in the United States. Unfortunately, her extreme popularity leaves her open to the bane of all favorite breeds: unscrupulous people who breed with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation. As a result, some Collies have serious health and temperament problems. If you are considering a Collie, you must be extremely careful from whom you purchase or adopt a puppy. Buy only from a reputable breeder. Never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Reputable breeders breed with temperament in mind and perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don"t pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases.
The Collie is usually quiet unless she has a reason to bark. However, if she is left alone too often or if she is bored, she will bark excessively. Both varieties need grooming, but the Rough Collie especially needs regular brushing to keep her coat clean and free of tangles. Many Collies are sensitive to medications including ivermectin, the drug used in heartworm preventives. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian before giving your Collie a heartworm preventive or any other drug. Be careful from whom you acquire a Collie. The Collie"s popularity has given rise to unethical breeders acting with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Collie is a native of Scotland, primarily from the Highland regions. She has been called Collis, Colley, Coally, and Coaly, names that probably derive from col or coll, the Anglo-Saxon word for black. Some historians think, however, that the name comes from the colley, the Scottish black-faced sheep, that the Collie dog used to guard. Original Collies were closer in size and shape to today"s Border Collies, and they were predominantly black. Herding ability was more important than appearance, so the dogs varied a great deal in looks. Stone Age nomads brought dogs to what is now Southern England, and from these came a hardy, intelligent dog used to herd sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Some historians say that the Collie"s particular ancestors were brought to the British Isles by Roman conquerors, some two thousand years ago. Queen Victoria is credited with saving Collies from obscurity. In 1860, she visited her Scotland estate and fell in love with the good looks and gentle temperament of the Collies she saw. She brought some back to England, and thus began the first Collie fad. It wasn"t long before the dogs were shown and bred for good looks rather than working ability. They first were exhibited in 1860 at a dog show in Birmingham, England, in the generic class known as "Scotch Sheep-Dogs." One Collie, named Old Cockie, who was born in 1867, is credited with the characteristic type of the Rough Collie known today, and she is believed to be responsible for introducing sable coat color to the breed. In 1879, the first Collie was imported to the United States. The Collie Club of America was formed on August 26, 1886, which makes it one of the oldest canine specialty clubs.
Males stand 24 to 26 inches tall; females are 22 to 24 inches tall. Collies weigh 50 to 70 pounds.
The well-bred Collie is sweet, friendly, and gentle. She is a family dog and enjoys being part of all household activities. Especially fond of kids, she enjoys playing with them and protectively watching over them. If those qualities weren"t positive enough, the Collie tops them with her intelligence and loyalty. This dog is smart and learns quickly. And her devotion? She would probably swim through shark-infested waters to save her owner (just like Lassie). Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Collie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Collie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Collies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Collies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Dermatomyositis: An inherited autoimmune skin disorder, this malady causes lesions and muscle problems. Studies indicate that perhaps 70 percent of Collies (both Rough and Smooth) could be carriers. Research currently is being conducted to identify the genes that carry this disease. Collie Nose: Also known as nasal solar dermatitis, this is a condition in which the skin of nose peels, oozes, and may lose color. If left untreated, it can be painful or develop into cancer. Collie nose is managed by limiting exposure to sunlight, using sunscreen, or tattooing with black ink to protect against harmful rays. Collie Eye Anomaly: This inherited condition can sometimes lead to blindness. The condition causes changes and abnormalities in the eye. These changes can include choroidal hypoplasia, an abnormal development of the choroid (an inner coat of the eyeball); coloboma, a defect in the optic disc; staphyloma, a thinning of the sclera (the white outer coat of the eyeball); and retinal detachment. Collie eye anomaly usually occurs by the time the dog is two years old. There is no treatment for the condition. Progressive Retinal atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they also lose their daytime vision. Many dogs adapt well to limited or complete vision loss, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Nodular Granulomatous Episclerokeratitis (NGE): Also called nodular fascitis, fibrous histiocytoma, or Collie granuloma, this condition is thought to be an immune disorder. It eventually causes damage to the cornea. Many Collies with Collie nose also have NGE. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive medications. Hip Dysplasia: This is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Allergies: Quite common is dogs, there are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Drug Sensitivity: The Collie is known to react to such drugs as ivermectin (found in heartworm control medication), anesthesia, and insecticides. Consult with your veterinarian before giving your Collie any medication or using flea or tick control products.
The Collie lives comfortably in the city or the country, as long as she has enough exercise. A brisk, daily walk and yard play are sufficient. Mostly, she wants to be with her family, meaning she is not a candidate for a backyard lifestyle. If left alone for too long, she tends to bark excessively. While some barking is normal in this herding breed — that"s how she warned the shepherd of wolves — she will bark her head off when she"s bored, lonely, or otherwise frustrated. Excessive barking can be avoided by letting the Collie join in all family activities, and by keeping her mentally challenged with ongoing obedience training or dog sports. Training the Collie is a breeze, but — like any dog — she needs early socialization to prevent her from becoming timid. She also benefits from obedience training; a "Quiet" command should be a part of every Collie"s training program.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Collie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Collie has two coat types: Rough (long hair) and Smooth (short hair). The Rough Collie has an abundant, straight outer coat that is harsh to the touch, and a soft, furry undercoat that is so thick it"s difficult to see the skin when you part the hair. The Smooth Collie has a short, dense, flat outer coat with a thick undercoat. Both varieties shed moderately. The Collie comes in four colors: sable (think Lassie), tricolor (black with white markings and tan shadings), blue merle (silvery blue and black), and white (predominately white with markings). The amount of grooming necessary for the Collie depends on the variety. Overall, the Collie is a clean dog, with minimal doggie odor. The long, full coat of the Rough Collie needs thorough brushing twice a week (even more frequently to keep her looking Lassie-like). Brushing once a week is sufficient for the Smooth Collie. Bathe as needed, usually every six to eight weeks. Many owners opt to pay a professional groomer to brush and bathe their Collie, especially the Rough variety, because the coat is so thick. Novice owners may find brushing challenging, though practice and instruction from a Collie breeder or skilled groomer can keep this from becoming a discouraging chore. Trim the Collie"s nails once a month, and check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Collie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Begin accustoming your Collie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The playful Collie is known for her love of children, even those she wasn"t raised with. She"s highly protective of the kids in her family, watching over them and keeping them safe from danger, just like Lassie did for Timmy. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Collie is also protective of and gentle with other pets in her family. She"s an affectionate, tender guardian, willing to watch over baby rabbits, chicks, or goats.
Collies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Collies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Collie rescue. The Collie Club of America

For the smart and sweet-natured Coton de Tulear (Coton for short), the perfect day consists of nothing more than being with his person, whether it"s lying at her feet while she works, following her from room to room — not even the bathroom is sacred — or going for a ride to Starbucks. This small, longhaired, cottony-coated dog was never bred to be anything but a companion, and to this day, that"s what he does best. He cocks his head intently when spoken to and will even try to answer back. The Coton de Tulear takes his name not only from his cottonlike coat but also from the seaport city of Tulear (now known as Toliara), located on the African island nation of Madagascar, where the breed originated. He"s related to the Bichon Frise and Maltese but has his own distinct style. People who love the Coton praise his intelligence, sociability, and easy-care coat. He"s an observant dog who quickly learns routines and adapts to his person"s needs. He sleeps while you"re busy, one eye cracked so he can follow if you leave the room. He"s known as a good and flexible traveler, perhaps a remnant of his seafaring days, when he accompanied ladies making long journeys by ship. When it"s playtime, the Coton will grab his favorite toy and bring it to you for a rousing game of fetch. He loves to go on walks, but his exercise needs aren"t excessive. Playing inside or in a fenced yard will just as easily satisfy his need for activity, as long as he has plenty of human companionship. Because of his desire to please, he excels in activities such as obedience and agility. The well-socialized Coton loves everyone. When your doorbell rings, the Coton may bark once, then politely accompany you to the door to greet your guest. The only risk a housebreaker faces is being licked to death. He likes to "talk" to his people, using his own special language of unique vocalizations, including grunts and growls. He"ll love it when you talk back to him. His soft, shaggy white coat may look difficult to care for, but once the adult coat has grown in, dirt falls out easily with brushing. Brushing three or four times weekly, plus bathing as needed, will keep your Coton clean. The Coton aims to please, and whatever makes you happy makes him happy — as long as it doesn"t involve being apart from you. Consider this breed if you"re a stay-at-home parent, empty-nester, or retiree who has lots of time to spend with a canine best friend and will enjoy taking him places.
The Coton de Tulear originated on the island of Madagascar and is related to the Bichon Frise and the Maltese. The Coton loves being with people and dislikes being separated from them. The Coton is smart and takes well to training. He"s an enthusiastic participant in agility and obedience competitions. The Coton is a hardy dog, but he"s a companion breed who should live indoors. He"s particularly well-suited to apartment living. Cotons enjoy playing and going for walks, but they adjust their activity to their people"s level. Cotons require brushing several times a week to prevent mats and tangles from forming. Bathe them as needed, weekly or monthly. Coton puppies need extra grooming while their adult coats are coming in, usually between seven and 15 months of age. Never buy a Coton from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, who breeds for sound temperaments, and who has signed the breed club"s code of ethics.
The large island of Madagascar, located off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, is home to many unusual creatures, but one of them has become a beloved export throughout the world: the soft and shaggy Coton de Tulear, a member of the Bichon family who probably came to Madagascar as long as several hundred years ago. It"s said that the little white dogs either accompanied ladies on long sea voyages or were used as ratters on ships. It"s also claimed that the dogs were beached on Madagascar after being the sole survivors of a shipwreck. However they arrived, they soon established themselves there. Some of the dogs became pets in the royal court and wealthy Madagascar households, while others were street urchins. It wasn"t until sometime in the 1970s, however, that a Frenchman visiting the island brought some Cotons back to France and worked to establish them as a breed. Cotons were brought to North America during the same decade. The Coton de Tulear is still found in his native land, but his sweet personality has made him a favorite throughout the world, including in the United States. He"s not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club, but he is registered with the AKC"s Foundation Stock Service (FSS), as well as the United Kennel Club and Europe"s Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI).
Male Cotons stand 10 to 12.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh 9 to 13 pounds; females are 8.5 to 11 inches and weigh 8 to 11 pounds.
The happy and boisterous Coton is a people-pleaser, who wants nothing more than to spend time with his humans. He forms strong bonds with family members and doesn"t like to be separated from them. He"s smart and easy to train, responding well to praise, play, and food rewards. He"ll play the clown for attention, which he loves. Cotons may bark once or twice if the doorbell rings or they see something interesting, but they don"t generally bark just for the fun of it. Guests and intruders alike run the risk of being licked to death. Females are more independent than males and often rule over them. Like every dog, Cotons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure your Coton puppy grows up to be a well-adjusted, happy dog.
The Coton is generally healthy. Following are some of the conditions that have been seen in Cotons, although they"re not widespread in the breed. Luxating patellas, (knees that slip in and out of place) are a common problem in any small breed, and the Coton is no exception. It"s important to protect puppies from jumping on and off furniture while their joints are still developing. Cotons think they"re invincible, as well as capable of flight, so it"s important to protect them from themselves. Hip Dysplasia (HD) is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness in one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it may sometimes be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a hereditary degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Reputable breeders provide health certifications for a puppy"s parents. In Cotons, expect to see Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) certification for knees, hips, elbows, and hearts, as well as certification of eye health from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation. Some breeders may also provide OFA thyroid certifications. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.
The Coton is a hardy dog who enjoys playing in all types of weather, including snow and rain. But he should always live indoors with his people (as should all dogs). He"s well-suited to living in any environment, from apartments to ranch houses, but if he has a yard it should be fenced so he doesn"t wander off — or get stolen away by someone who admires him as much as you do. Some people find the Coton difficult to housetrain, but given a regular schedule, frequent outings to do his business, and praise when he potties in the right place, a Coton can pick it up very quickly. Crate-training can help him learn to wait until he"s taken outside to potty, as well prevent him from getting into trouble when you"re not around to supervise. Cotons take well to training, especially when it"s presented in a positive manner. Reward him with praise, play, and treats, and let him know what a great job he"s done. Remember that his goal is to please you.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 cup daily of a high-quality dog food, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Coton de Tulear in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Coton, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Coton"s coat is one of his distinguishing features. It"s long, soft, and thick, with what can only be described as a fluffy, cottony texture. By adulthood, it"s usually four inches long. The coat is white, although it may have a few shadings of light gray or red-roan (a mixture of white and fawn hairs) on the ears. Puppies are born all white or with yellow, brown, rust, or black spots on the head, ears, and sometimes the body. These spots disappear as puppies mature, leaving behind areas that range in color from light to medium champagne or gray. Cotons shed little, mainly in the spring. They"re often recommended for people with allergies, but it"s always wise to meet and spend time with a number of different Cotons before deciding you can actually live with one. To prevent matted fur, brush the coat three or four times a week with a pin brush that has uncoated metal pins. Pay special attention to the areas behind the ears, legs, and elbows. Using a spray conditioner as you brush will keep hair breakage to a minimum. The more often you brush, the less frequently you"ll have to bathe him. A fine-toothed metal comb and a smaller comb for the face will also help keep your Coton looking sharp. If you want to see his eyes, use a coated hair elastic to create a cute topknot. You can also keep his coat in a short puppy clip for easier care. Depending on how dirty he gets, your Coton may need to be bathed weekly, every two weeks, or monthly. When bathing your Coton, you"ll probably want to use a whitening shampoo to keep him looking his best. After a bath, pat him damp dry instead of rubbing him with a towel or his coat will knot up. Then you can brush the coat out as you blow him dry. The adult coat starts coming in between seven and 15 months of age, and during this time your Coton puppy will need additional grooming to prevent mats and tangles. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Coton"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar and bacterial buildup. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Coton jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Coton accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Cotons are good with kids if kids are good with them. They"re fun-loving and energetic enough to be playmates for older children who treat them respectfully, but they"ll learn to hide from clumsy younger children who may pat them too hard or accidentally kick them or step on them. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child to never approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Cotons prefer the company of people, but they get along well with other Cotons, dogs of other breeds, and cats. If his people aren"t around all the time, a Coton will appreciate having the company of another animal.

The dense curls of the Curly-Coated Retriever leave many wondering if the breed is a cross between a poodle and a retriever. They might be surprised to learn that he is the oldest recognized retriever around. The Curly-Coated Retriever is a large dog with an even larger heart. One glimpse of this breed in action tells you that he"s an ideal hunting dog, filled with the drive and determination that all retrievers possess. His unusual coat — a dense mass of small, tight, crisp black or dark reddish-brown curls — is often mistakenly believed to be difficult to care for, but it"s actually fairly easy, requiring only moderate grooming. In addition to his hunting ability, this active, intelligent dog is a wonderful jogging companion and family friend. An active family, that is. With his retriever drive, he needs daily exercise and mental stimulation in the form of training and play to keep from becoming bored and destructive. The Curly, as he"s known, is loyal to his family and displays the even temper that is so well loved in all retriever breeds. He"s more reserved with strangers than other retrievers, however, and needs to be properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — to prevent timidity. They do very well with children as long as you lay down some ground rules for dog and child. No ear pulling, tail pulling or biting allowed! For the safety of both, never leave small children unsupervised with any dog. Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared to live with a full-grown dog who acts like a puppy for several years. Because they"re high-energy dogs, they"re not suited to apartment life and should live in a home with a large fenced yard where they have plenty of room to romp. Like all retrievers, Curlies are mouthy and love to chew, nip, and carry objects. Be prepared for this trait, and work with it by providing your Curly with toys he"s allowed to chew, praising him when you see him chewing them, and keeping forbidden items out of reach. Be consistent. If he"s not allowed to chew on your good shoes, don"t give him an old one to play with. He doesn"t know the difference between Payless and Prada. For the active individual or family who would like a retriever who stands out from the crowd, the Curly-Coated Retriever is an excellent choice, as he enjoys hunting, fishing and camping in the great outdoors followed by quiet indoor evenings relaxing with his people.
The Curly-Coated Retriever has the most unusual coat of all of the retriever breeds. The coat requires only moderate grooming, and the breed sheds only twice a year. Curly-Coated Retrievers generally have an oily coat, which is more likely to cause reactions in people with allergies. Curly-Coated Retrievers are more reserved around strangers than other retriever breeds and needs to be properly socialized to avoid any timidity. Curly-Coated Retrievers are sporting dogs and have the energy that other sporting and working dogs have. If they are not given adequate exercise, at least 30 to 60 minutes per day, they can become quite destructive in their boredom. Curly-Coated Retrievers tend to be mouthy and will nip and chew everything in reach, including toys, clothes, and hands. The Curly-Coated Retriever is intelligent and enjoys working, but he needs a strong, confident owner who will keep him from taking charge. He also needs variety in training and activities because he tends to get bored doing the same old thing again and again. Curly-Coated Retrievers are more difficult to find than other breeds, but it is still important to look for the best possible breeder, even if long waiting lists await you. Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared for your dog to act puppylike for at least three years. In general, Curly-Coated Retrievers do well with children but small children should never be left unsupervised with any dog regardless of breed. Curly-Coated Retrievers are not meant for apartments and do better in homes with a large yard where they can expend their energy. They are quieter in homes when their energy levels are met. Although they enjoy the great outdoors, Curly-Coated Retrievers are not dogs who can be kenneled outside. They enjoy being with their family and can become very destructive when left away from them. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Little is known about the Curly"s origin. He may be descended from now-extinct English Water Spaniels and retrieving setters as well as other retriever-type dogs, including Poodles which, essentially, are retrievers themselves. Whatever his makeup, his first appearance in the show ring was in England in 1860, and he is thought to have been the first dog used for serious retrieving. He was especially prized by gamekeepers, who appreciated his hunting ability, courage, and perseverance. The Curly"s popularity waned, however, as the Labrador became a favorite with hunters. The war years didn"t help. After World War I, in 1919, only five Curly-Coated Retrievers were registered. The breed began to recover but again almost died out during World War II. Curly-Coated Retrievers were first imported into the United States in 1907, and the first one registered with the American Kennel Club was Knysna Conjurer in 1924. The breed saw a resurgence in the United States in the late 1960s when many Curly-Coated Retrievers were imported from England, Australia, and New Zealand. The Curly-Coated Retriever Club of America was founded in 1979.
A Curly-Coated male is 25 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 80 to 100 pounds; a female is 23 to 25 inches and weighs 65 to 85 pounds.
The Curly-Coat is full of retriever drive and determination. He"ll work "til the job is done. In the field or at home, he"s alert and self-confident. He has an even temper but is more reserved with strangers than other retrievers. Early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — helps prevent timidity. That said, don"t confuse his independence and poise with shyness or a lack of willingness to please. Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared to live with a full-grown puppy for several years. Curlies have a mind of their own and need a confident owner who won"t allow them to run the show. The Curly-Coated Retriever responds well to training, although not always as quickly as other dogs. That doesn"t mean he"s dumb. He simply gets bored easily. Keep him interested with a variety of training exercises. It"s not unusual for a Curly to ignore his trainer when an exercise or activity becomes repetitive.
Curly-Coated Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Curlies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Curlies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, weight loss to reduce the pressure on the joints, or medication to control the pain. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Curly has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can and should be corrected surgically. Ectropion: This defect is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, usually the lower one, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infections such as conjunctivitis. Severe cases can be treated with surgery. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Persistent Pupillary Membranes (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is most commonly a congenital hereditary disease, meaning the dog is born with it and it was passed to him by his parents, but it can also result from trauma or prenatal herpesvirus or parvovirus infections. It can be mild or severe and is caused by an abnormal development of the retina, resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. Retinal dysplasia can be detected as early as six to eight weeks of age. There is no known treatment for retinal dysplasia, but many blind dogs live full lives, and their other senses compensate for the vision impairment. Pattern Baldness: This gradual thinning of the hair follows one of three patterns. The first is more commonly found in females and the baldness occurs around the temples, on the chest, abdomen, back of the thighs, and under the neck. The second occurs more commonly in males and is the loss of hair on the ears. The third is also more commonly found in males and is the loss of hair on the back of the thighs, underneath the neck and on the tail. There is no treatment for Pattern Baldness. Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD): This metabolic disorder occurs when glycogen, a complex carbohydrate, is unable to be released and used by the body. This deficiency can lead to other disorders such as skeletal muscle disease and liver disease. Signs of Glycogen Storage Disease can be lethargy, collapse, exercise intolerance, and a prolonged recovery from exercise. A DNA test is now available to determine which dogs carry the recessive gene. Dogs that are carriers should not be bred, and they should absolutely never be bred to another carrier. It is important to ensure that your puppy"s breeder has had her dogs cleared of this condition. There is also a registry of GSD cleared Curly-Coated Retrievers and you can view this at http://www.flairfor.com/GlycogenStorageDiseaseIIIa.html Lymphosarcoma: Lymphosarcoma is the third most common cancer that affects dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer is treated with chemotherapy and approximately 80 percent of dogs treated will go into remission. Adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma is a growth of malignant cells and is one of the most common types of canine cancers. The cells usually originate in the uterus, mammary glands, and intestines. Often these cells spread to the lungs and other parts of the body, including the area around the anus. Nearly 80 percent of lung tumors are adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinoma is treated by removing the tumors and affected lymph nodes surgically and providing chemotherapy. Other treatments may be used depending on the area affected. Fibrosarcoma: This tumor is found in fibrous connective tissue and can affect any part of the body, including bone. It is the third most common type of bone cancer and can spread from the bone to the lungs, heart, lymph nodes, and kidneys. Treatment may involve one or all of the following: surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic and hyperthermia therapy, radiation therapy, and in some cases amputation of a limb. Mast Cell Tumors: Also known as Mastocytoma, or Mast Cell Sarcoma, these are the most common skin tumors seen in dogs and are found in the loose connective tissue in the body. The tumors often form on the skin of the area around the anus, the legs, or the trunk of the dog but they can be found on the head and neck. Treatment varies and may involve surgery or chemotherapy. Hemangiosarcoma: This form of malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels as well as the spleen. Melanoma: Melanoma is a cancer of the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) of the skin. It is commonly found on the skin, but it can also be found on the inside of the mouth and gums. The malignant melanocytes spread from the skin lesions through the blood and lymph vessels. This can lead to other tumors and cause the death of the dog. Treatment is usually surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In the case of oral melanoma, a part of the jawbone may be surgically removed. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (Bloat): This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
Curly-Coated Retrievers need a half hour to an hour a day of exercise and stimulation. One of the best ways to keep a Curly active and stimulated is to provide him with a variety of jobs, from walks to swimming to carrying light items for you. Puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes will keep Curlies entertained, as will training them for obedience, agility, and other dog activities. Curly-Coated Retrievers are rambunctious as puppies. Early training is a must, and it"s a great way to bond with your active pup. Puppies have a high activity level, but they also need lots of naps to recharge, so the hard exercise you might give an adult isn"t necessary for them. Curly-Coated Retrievers tend to be mouthy and will nip and chew everything they find. This can cause expensive veterinary bills if the puppy happens to eat something that could harm him. To keep your puppy safe and to help with housetraining, crate training is recommended. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Curly doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Curly accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Curly in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Curlies are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Curly, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Curly-Coated Retriever has a unique coat: a mass of small, crisp curls that lie close to the skin and cover the body from the tail all the way up to the top of the head. It"s water- and weather-resistant and protects the skin from any rough brush the dog might run through as he hunts. The curls on the ears might be slightly looser than the curls on the body, and occasionally a Curly has feathering — a longer fringe of hair — on the ears, belly, thighs, feet, and back of the forelegs, but this is usually trimmed. If there is feathering on the tail, people with show dogs remove it, but it certainly doesn"t affect a Curly"s ability to be a great companion. On the forehead, face, feet, and front of the forelegs, the coat is short and straight. The hair has a dense, rough texture, never silky or dry and brittle. You definitely shouldn"t see any bald patches. The color of the Curly-Coated Retriever is black or liver, described as a deep reddish-brown. You might see a few white hairs in the coat, but no large white patches. A Curly-Coated Retriever has a relatively easy-care coat and usually sheds only twice a year, although the amount of shedding varies among individual dogs. Preparation in puppyhood is key. As with all breeds, it"s important to start grooming your Curly-Coated Retriever puppy when he"s young. Make grooming a positive and soothing experience, and he"ll be easier for you and other people to handle when he"s grown. As you groom, take time to check your Curly"s overall condition. Keep an eye out for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness or discharge anywhere on his body. It"s not normal for any part of his body to smell bad, including his mouth and ears. Trim his nails as needed so they don"t catch on something and tear. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Other aspects of grooming preparation are housing and diet. A Curly who sleeps on hard concrete or in a dirty crate will develop a bad coat, which can lead to bald spots. And a poor-quality diet can cause the coat to be dry. Not every dog food is appropriate for every dog. Try different foods until you find the one that meets your Curly"s individual dietary needs. You"ll know you"ve found it when he has a super coat and skin. Brush or comb your Curly when he"s shedding in the spring and fall, using a wood or plastic wide-toothed comb. More frequent brushing or combing can give his curly coat the frizzies. Taking your Curly swimming or otherwise wetting his coat helps tame the frizzies. Shedding season is also a good time to give him a bath. He shouldn"t need one on a regular basis unless he"s gotten into something stinky. Use a shampoo made for dogs to keep the coat from drying out.
The Curly-Coated Retriever is a great companion for older children who can stand up to his size and energy level, but he may be overwhelming for younger children who are easily knocked down in play. Any time your Curly interacts with children, lay down some ground rules for dog and child. No ear pulling, tail pulling or biting allowed! For the safety of both, never leave small children unsupervised with any dog. Curly-Coated Retrievers generally do very well with other dogs and animals but socialization is still important in regard to animal interactions.

Don"t let the Dachshund fool you. He might be, as legendary literary critic and humorous journalist H. L. Mencken said, "half a dog high and a dog and a half long," but this small, drop-eared dog is tough enough to take on a badger. In fact, that"s what he was bred to do and how he got his name (Dachs meaning badger; hund meaning dog). Dachshunds (pronounced DAKS hund  —  never dash-hound) come in three varieties: smooth (shorthaired), wirehaired and longhaired. In the United States, Dachshunds are either miniature (11 pounds and under as an adult) or standard (usually between 16 and 32 pounds as an adult). If your Dachshund weighs between 11 and 16 pounds, he"s called a tweenie. Other countries have a wider variance in the sizes. For example, in Germany, the official birthplace of the Dachshund breed, Dachshunds are identified as Standard, Miniature, or Kaninchenteckel, based on a chest measurement taken at the age of fifteen months. No matter what their size, Dachshunds are a delightful addition to any family, which is why they have ranked near the top of most popular dogs lists since the 1950s. Their cute appearance and lively disposition have inspired many affectionate nicknames for the breed, including wiener dog, hot dog, sausage dog, Doxie, Dashie, and (especially in Germany) Teckels, Dachels, or Dachsels You can"t help but smile when you look at a confident Dachshund, proudly carrying his long, muscular body on short legs, his elongated head held high with a bold, intelligent look in his eyes. Because of their almost comical appearance, Dachshunds have long been a favorite subject of cartoonists and toy makers. But their cute appearance was developed for far more serious and practical reasons. Their short legs enable them to dig and maneuver through tunnels to corner and even fight badgers and other animals, while their large chests give them plenty of "heart" for the fight. Dachshunds are brave, but they can be somewhat stubborn, and have an independent spirit, especially when hunting. At home, the Dachshund"s playful nature comes out. He loves to be close to you and "help" you do things like tie your shoes. Because of his intelligence, he often has his own ideas about what the rules are when it comes to playtime-and those rules may not be the same as yours or even other breeds of dogs. Dachshunds are known for being lively and enjoy chasing other small animals, birds, and toys. The breed standard — a written description of how the Dachshund should look and act — probably describes their personality best, saying "the Dachshund is clever, lively, and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault." Dachshunds have soulful eyes and complex facial expressions. Their lungs are large for a dog this size and they have a barrel-like chest. Because of these things, Dachshunds have a loud, deep bark that sounds as though it comes from a much larger dog. And they do like to bark, which is something you might consider if you have neighbors who could be annoyed rather than amused by the antics of your brave little Dachshund. Dachshunds often bond closely with a single person. They may even become jealous of their owner"s attention and can, if not properly trained and socialized, become snappy. Smooth Dachshunds are the most popular variety in the United States. Their coats are short and shiny and need little grooming. They do, however, need a sweater in the winter if you live in an area with cold weather. Common colors are red, cream, black and tan, black and cream, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, and Isabella (fawn) and tan. Dachshunds also can have patterns in their coats, such as dapple (a mottled coat pattern), brindle, sable, and piebald. Longhaired Dachshunds have sleek, slightly wavy hair and can be the same colors as the Smooth Dachshund. They should be brushed every day to prevent mats from forming, especially around their elbows and ears. Many believe that the Longhaired Dachshund has a more docile temperament than the Smooth or Wirehair. Wirehaired Dachshunds have wiry, short, thick, rough coats with bushy eyebrows and a beard. Like Smooth Dachshunds, they often are mischievous. They won"t need a sweater in the winter, but they do need to be brushed regularly to prevent mats from forming. Their coat colors can be the same as the Smooth Dachshund, but the most popular colors in the United States are wild boar (a mixture of black, brown, and gray), black and tan, and various shades of red. Dachshunds often have been seen as a symbol of Germany. Because of this association, Dachshunds lost popularity in the United States during World War I and World War II. Their appeal was too great for this to resist, however, and they quickly made a comeback in popularity. Because of the association with Germany, a Dachshund named Waldi was chosen to be the first official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics. Dachshunds are a good choice for apartment dwellers and people who don"t have a backyard. They are popular with urban dwellers because of their small size and ease of care. They generally are active indoors and also enjoy going on walks. Just be careful not to let them get too fat or allow them to injure their backs by jumping off furniture. Also, be sure to support their backs when you are holding them. Because of their long backs, they are susceptible to slipped or ruptured (herniated) disks in their backs, which can result in partial or full paralysis. Although they originally were bred to hunt ferocious badgers and other animals, today"s Dachshunds are ideal family companions. Additionally, many people show them in conformation, obedience, agility, field trials, and earthdog trials. They are also hard-working and well-appreciated therapy dogs. Some people enter their Dachshunds in Dachshund races, such as the Wiener Nationals. Although these races are popular, the Dachshund Club of America opposes "wiener racing" because many Greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds and because the DCA worries that such races could injure Dachshunds" backs. Because they are such a popular breed, many people breed Dachshunds to make money rather than out of a love for the breed and a desire to breed healthy, even-tempered dogs. Be careful to obtain your Dachshund from a reputable breeder who screens his or her breeding animals for both temperament and health problems. The Dachshund is a versatile companion. With his variety of sizes, colors, coat types, and personalities, there"s a Dachshund to suit almost anyone.
Dachshunds can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate-training is recommended. Dachshunds are intelligent dogs with an independent nature and playful spirit. Because of this, they can be mischievous. Be patient, firm, and consistent when training them. Because they were bred for hunting, they can exhibit some behaviors that are related to that. They were designed to dig into badger burrows, and that instinct may lead them to dig up your dahlias instead. They were bred to be tenacious in the hunt, and this instinct may lead them to be relentless in pestering you for a treat. They were bred to not only hunt but kill their prey; in your household, the "prey" most likely will be your Dachshund"s toys and he will effectively "kill" them one after the other. Dachshunds have loud, deep barks for a dog their size - and they do like to bark! If you don"t watch out, your Dachshund can become fat and lazy, which will put more strain on his fragile back. Be sure to monitor your Dachshund"s food intake and keep him at a healthy weight. Dachshunds are prone to having slipped disks in their backs, which can lead to partial or full paralysis. Don"t let them jump from high places, and when you hold them, support their backs. Your Dachshund will probably be a one-person dog. By nature, he can be suspicious of strangers, so it"s important to socialize him when he is a puppy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The Dachshund was created in Germany where he was known as the badger dog, dachs meaning badger and hund meaning dog. Illustrations of dogs resembling Dachshunds date to the 15th century, and documents from the 16th century mention the "earth dog," "badger creeper," and "dachsel." Badger wasn"t the Dachshund"s only prey. He was also used on den animals such as foxes, and packs of Dachshunds trailed wild boar. Those early Dachshunds varied greatly in size. The dogs used on badgers and boar weighed 30 to 35 pounds. Dachshunds used to hunt foxes and deer weighed 16 to 22 pounds, and smaller 12-pound Dachshunds hunted hares and weasels. For a brief time in the early 20th century, 5-pound Dachshunds were used to bolt cottontail rabbits. Known as the Teckel in Germany, the breed was refined over the course of many years by German foresters in the 18th and 19th centuries. They wanted to develop a fearless, elongated dog that could dig into badger burrows, and then go into the burrows to fight the badger to the death if necessary. The Smooths were the original type, created through crosses with the Braque, a small French pointing breed, and the Pinscher, a small terrier-type ratter. French Basset Hounds may also have played a role in the Dachshund"s development. The long-coated Dachshunds were probably created through crosses with various spaniels and the wirehairs through crosses with terriers. Carefully sculpted through years of breeding, today the Dachshund is the only AKC-recognized breed that hunts both above and below ground. Their short, powerful legs enabled Dachshunds to go deep into narrow tunnels to pursue their prey. Their long, sturdy tails, extending straight from the spine, provided hunters with a "handle" to pull the Dachshund out of the burrow. The Dachshund"s unusually large and paddle-shaped paws were perfect for efficient digging. The Smooth Dachshund"s loose skin wouldn"t tear as the dog traversed into tight burrows. Their deep chest with ample lung capacity gave them the stamina to hunt, and their long noses enabled them to be good scent hounds. Even their deep, loud bark had a reason - so the hunter to locate his dog after it had gone into a burrow. And of course, they had to be bold and tenacious. Although the original German Dachshunds were larger than the Dachshunds we know today, you can still see the fearlessness for which the breed was developed in even the smallest varieties. Give your Dachshund a squeaky toy and he"ll likely "kill" it by destroying the squeaker as quickly as possible. Remember, these dogs were bred not only to hunt prey, but kill it as well. In the 1800s, Dachshunds started being bred more as pets than as hunters, especially in Great Britain. They were favorites in royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was especially fond of the breed. Due to this trend, their size was gradually reduced by about 10 pounds. Eventually, an even smaller version - the miniature dachshund - was bred. A breed standard was written in 1879, and the German Dachshund Club was founded nine years later, in 1888. By 1885, Dachshunds had made it to America, and 11 were registered with the American Kennel Club that year. The first one was named Dash. The Dachshund Club of America was founded 10 years later, in 1895. The breed became very popular in the early 1900s, and in 1913 and 1914, they were among the 10 most popular entries in the Westminster Kennel Club Show. During World War I, however, the breed fell on hard times in the U.S. and England because they were closely associated with Germany. Dachshund owners sometimes were called traitors and their dogs stoned. After World War I, some U.S. breeders imported some Dachshunds from Germany and the breed started to become popular once again. The breed faced a similar fate during World War II, but not nearly so severely as during World War I. In the 1950s, Dachshunds became one of the most popular family dogs in the U.S. again, a status they have enjoyed ever since. While Dachshunds rarely are used as hunting dogs in the U.S. or Great Britain, in other parts of Europe, especially France, they still are considered hunting dogs. Today the Dachshund ranks sixth among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Dachshunds are bred and shown in two sizes: Standard and Miniature. Standard Dachshunds of all varieties (Smooth, Wirehair, and Longhair) usually weigh between 16 and 32 pounds. Miniature Dachshunds of all varieties weigh 11 pounds and under at maturity. Dachshunds that weigh between 11 and 16 pounds are called Tweenies. While this isn"t an official classification, Tweenies are not penalized in the show ring. Some people who breed exceptionally small Dachshunds advertise them as Toy Dachshunds, but this is purely a marketing term, not a recognized designation.
The Dachshund is described as clever, lively, and courageous to the point of rashness. He"s bred for perseverance, which is another way of saying that he can be stubborn. Dachshunds have a reputation for being entertaining and fearless, but what they want most is to cuddle with their people. For many Dachshund people, this characteristic outweighs having to deal with the breed"s insistence on having his own way. The Dachshund personality can also vary with coat type. Because the wirehaired Dachshunds have terrier in their background, they can be mischievous troublemakers. Longhairs are calm and quiet, and Smooths have a personality that lies somewhere in between. Some Mini Dachshunds can be nervous or shy, but this isn"t correct for the breed. Avoid puppies that show these characteristics. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who"s available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Dachshunds need early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dachshund puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Not all Bouviers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): Dachshunds are especially prone to having back problems. This may be due to genetics, moving the wrong way, or falling or jumping on or off furniture. Symptoms of a problem include an inability to raise up on the rear legs, paralysis, and sometimes loss of bowel and bladder control. It"s important to always support your Dachshund"s back and rear when holding him. Treatment may consist of anything from crate confinement with anti-inflammatory medications to surgery to remove the discs that are causing the problem or even confining the dog to a doggie wheelchair. Some owners have found that they can help ward off problems by taking their Dachshunds to chiropractors, acupuncturists, or rehabilitation therapists who have experience working with dogs. Epilepsy: Dachshunds are prone to having epileptic seizes. In dogs that are affected, it"s thought that the condition is either genetic or brought about as the result of a fall or a hard blow to the head. If your Dachshund has seizures, take him to your vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. In many cases, epilepsy can be controlled with medication. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. A DNA test for PRA is available for miniature longhaired Dachshunds. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) Also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that most often affects large dogs, but because of their deep chests, it also can affect Dachshunds. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. This is a medical emergency. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited. Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much of a hormone called cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance in the pituitary gland or in the adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol from other conditions. The most common signs are excess urination and excess drinking. If your Dachshund exhibits these signs, take him to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease from the removal of a gland to medications. Canine Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Diabetes is occasionally seen in Dachshunds, particularly if they"re overweight. Diabetes can be treated with diet and daily insulin injections. Signs include excessive urination and thirst and weight loss despite a ravenous appetite Deafness: Hearing loss isn"t common in the breed, but it can occur in double dapple Dachshunds. Ask if the puppy and its parents were BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) tested for hearing loss. This is not available in all areas but is available at most large specialty practices and teaching hospitals at veterinary schools. It can be done any time after the puppy is five weeks old. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Dachshunds, you should expect to see a health clearance from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF), certifying that the eyes are normal. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.
Dachshunds have a lot of stamina and energy. They love to take a walk or play outdoors with other dogs, and they like to hunt and dig. They are also active inside the house and can do well in small living quarters so long as they get a moderate amount of daily exercise. Two half-mile walks a day (about 10 minutes each) is about right. Occasionally, when time is short, a game of fetch will meet their need for activity. They"re not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel but should live in the home. Dachshunds can injure their backs jumping on and off furniture, so get a ramp or steps and teach them to use it if they want up on the sofa or bed. When you hold a Dachshund, always be careful to support his rear and his chest. Dachshunds can learn quickly if properly motivated. Use positive reinforcements such as food rewards or a favorite toy to hold their attention, and keep training sessions short. The Dachshund will quickly become bored if made to repeat the same exercise over and over, so make obedience practice fun and interesting. Housetraining can sometimes be a problem with this breed. A Dachshund may not see the need for eliminating outside. Patience and consistency are musts. Crate training helps as well. Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Dachshund doesn"t get into things he shouldn"t. Like every dog, Dachshunds can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Dachshund accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Dachshund in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Dachshunds are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Dachshund excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Minis, in particular, can be yappy. Keep this in mind if your Dachshund will be living in an apartment or condo community.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of high-quality dry food a day Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Dachshund, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Smooth Dachshund"s coat is short and shiny. Single-colored Smooth Dachshunds often are red or cream, perhaps with some black hairs. Two-colored Smooth Dachshunds usually are black, chocolate, wild boar (grizzled), gray (blue) or Isabella (fawn) with tan or cream markings. Dappled Dachshunds have a dappled (merle) pattern in their coats, with light and dark colored areas in even distribution (neither the light nor the dark predominates). Whereas dark eyes are required and little or no white hair on the chest is acceptable for solid- and parti-colored Dachshunds, partially or wholly blue eyes and a large amount of white hair on the chest both acceptable for the dappled Dachshunds. Other color patterns are brindle, in which there are dark stripes all over the body, and sable, where there is an overall dark overlay of hair. Wirehaired Dachshunds have a very different coat from the Smooth Dachshunds. They have short, thick, hard hair on the topcoat with a softer undercoat. The hard topcoat hair is found everywhere on the body except for the jaw, eyebrows, and ears. While all the colors found in the Smooth Dachshund are acceptable for the Wirehair, the most common color is wild boar. Longhaired Dachshunds have glistening, slightly wavy long hair which gives them an elegant appearance. They come in the same colors found in Smooth Dachshunds. Light-colored Dachshunds usually sport light gray, light hazel, green or blue eyes, rather than the various shades of brown. They can also have eyes of two different colors; in rare cases, such as the double-dapple coloration (in which varying amounts of white coloring occur over the body in addition to the dapple pattern), Dachshunds can have a blue and a brown eye. Dachshunds are a low-maintenance breed. They shed, but not excessively. Unless they"ve rolled in something that smells bad, they generally don"t need to be bathed often and are free of doggie odor. Smooths can be wiped with a damp cloth between baths to keep them clean. If you live in a location that is cold in the winter, your Smooth Dachshund may need a sweater when he goes outside. Wirehaired Dachshunds require regular brushing, and they"ll need to have their coats "stripped" two to three times a year to look their best. Ask the breeder from whom you got your Wirehaired Dachshund or your groomer to show you how to do this. Longhaired Dachshunds must be brushed regularly to prevent mats from forming. They need to be bathed more often than the Smooth Dachshund, and you must blow-dry them afterward for their coat to look good. For all varieties and sizes of Dachshunds, you need to pay special attention to their droopy ears, which can be a breeding ground for fungus, bacteria, and mites. Moisten a cotton ball with an ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian and wipe the ears out weekly. Don"t go any deeper than the first knuckle on your finger and never stick a cotton swab into your dog"s ear. Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Dachshund"s nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Dachshund to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Dachshunds are good with children in their own family if introduced to them early. They may not be as fond of your children"s friends, so supervise playtime. With his long back, the Dachshund can be easily injured if he"s not handled properly. Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Dachshund if they"re sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Dachshunds get along well with other pets, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. With their bold, domineering personalities, they may well be top dog.
Dachshunds are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an Dachshund, a rescue group is a good place to start.

With his regal carriage and unique spots, the Dalmatian is probably one of the most recognized breeds on the planet. Many people are attracted to his dashing good looks, but he"s definitely not for everyone. While Dalmatians love to be with their people for any activity that occurs in the course of a day and can make wonderful companion dogs, their high energy level can be exhausting to live with.Dalmations were created to run for miles alongside carriages, helping to ward off highwaymen and add a touch of flair to the vehicle with aristocratic passengers. (Now we just have cars with racing stripes.) Not surprisingly, the Dalmatian today has an endless capacity for exercise and is the ideal companion for people who jog, skate, or bicycle. He"s also a keen competitor in canine sports such as agility and flyball. A Dalmatian must have adequate daily exercise to prevent behavior problems from developing.If you are considering a Dalmatian, be aware that the breed is not only highly active but also highly intelligent. They need training early in life to establish rules for behavior, or they will decide it is their job to run things. Dalmatians can be a bit headstrong so training must be firm and consistent.At the same time Dalmatians are sensitive and do not respond well to harsh training methods. You need a positive approach to training with lots of rewards for proper behavior if you want a well-trained dog. Dalmatians are said to not forget mistreatment or harsh behavior.Another consideration should be the incidence of deafness in the breed. This condition is prevalent in Dalmatians. It is inherited as a polygenic trait, and all Dalmatian bloodlines can pass along deafness to their offspring. Approximately eight percent of Dalmatians are born completely deaf, and 22 to 24 percent are born with hearing in one ear only.The Dalmatian Club of America recommends euthanasia for all puppies found to be completely deaf. That"s because they are more challenging to train and may bite if startled. Nonetheless, some people believe deaf dogs can make just as wonderful pets as hearing dogs if they are trained with hand signals and vibrations so they are less likely to be startled.If you are considering adopting a deaf puppy or older adult dog, be sure to research the issue and the special care requirements of living with a deaf dog before you suffer the heartbreak of taking the dog in and not being able to manage his care properly.Dalmatians have a urinary system unique in the dog world, and they have a few special requirements because of this to prevent medical complications. Their diet should never be extremely high in protein, and they must be allowed access to plenty of fresh water at all times. Dalmatians also should have the opportunity to relieve themselves frequently to keep the urinary system flushed. With these simple protocols in place, your Dalmatian should live a long, healthy life.Dalmatians will get along with other pets and children if socialized as a puppy with all types of pets and people. Dalmatians can make a wonderful active playmate for children (with proper supervision to be sure that both the child and the dog are following acceptable rules for behavior).With the Dalmatian"s energy and enthusiasm for games, the dog and child will have a marvelous time tiring each other out. Children younger than 6 years of age may be easily knocked down by this muscular, active, and strong dog. Take special precautions and supervise interactions between smaller children and Dalmatians.You can participate in numerous dog sports and activities with your Dalmatian. He"ll do well in obedience competition with the proper motivational, positive training. He"s also an excellent agility competitor as the sport is tailored to athletic dogs such as the Dalmatian.Dalmatians make great hiking companions and backpacking dogs, and the sports of flyball and Frisbee are excellent activities for the well-trained Dalmatian. If your dog has the right combination of looks and personality, you may also enjoy the sport of showing dogs, known as conformation, at AKC shows.The Dalmatian Club of America sponsors a program that offers titles in keeping with the breed"s history as carriage dogs. The Road Dog (RD) title and Road Dog Excellent (RDX) are titles earned by the dog accompanying horses or carriages for a certain number of miles and then performing some basic obedience. These trials are usually held in conjunction with the larger specialty shows and with the national show sponsored by the Dalmatian Club of America.Whatever you do with your Dalmatian, whether he is your best friend, active family companion, or seasoned competitor, be sure that with the right combination of exercise, discipline, and love he will be a great addition to your family.
Dalmatians need daily exercise or they will become bored and destructive. Dalmatians shed! Brushing frequently and thoroughly can help to keep shedding under control, but Dalmatians will shed. Dalmatians need training to help make them well-mannered members of the family. They can be headstrong, so without consistent, firm training you could end up with an unmanageable adult. Early socialization to other dogs, cats and other small pets, children, and adults is a must. Dalmatians do not like to spend long periods of time alone. They do best when they can be included in all family activities and sleep and live where their human family does. Families with small children should be aware that Dalmatians are very exuberant and active dogs and may accidentally knock small children down. The animated and live-action movies "101 Dalmatians," both by Disney, caused an extreme rise in the popularity of the breed. Unscrupulous people looking to cash in on the boom bred Dalmatians indiscriminately, paying no attention to health or temperament. Be a cautious and informed consumer when looking for your Dalmatian puppy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Dalmatian"s origins are unknown. The spotted dogs are known to have traveled with the nomadic bands of Romanies, sometimes called gypsies, and it"s unclear where they may have first appeared. The Dalmatian obtained his name during his stay in Dalmatia, a province on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea, the area that is now known as Croatia.Dalmatians have been utilized for a variety of jobs during their long history, never specializing in one area. They were used as guard dogs in Dalmatia, shepherds, ratters, retrievers, circus dogs, and coaching dogs.It was in England that the Dalmatian was developed as the definitive coaching dog. He was used to clear a path before the horses, run alongside the coach or under the coach between the axels. He guarded the horses and coach when they were at rest. To this day the Dalmatian has a natural affinity for horses.This affinity took the Dalmatian on a different career path in the United States. Here he became a firehouse dog, running with the horses to the fire, watching over the equipment during a fire, and sometimes even rescuing people from burning buildings. When the excitement was over, they accompanied the fire wagons back to the station and resumed their duty as watchdog. Today most Dalmatians are companions and family members but many firehouses across the country still have Dalmatians as mascots.
Males and females stand between 19 and 24 inches tall. Weight ranges from 48 to 55 pounds. Males are generally larger than females.
Born to run, the Dalmatian is a high-energy dog with an endless capacity for exercise. He loves attention and has a strong desire to please, making him easy to train through positive reinforcement such as food rewards, praise, and play.He"s a smart dog with a sly sense of humor, and will do his best to make you laugh. The Dalmatian is alert and interested in everything that goes on around him and makes an excellent watchdog.Like every dog, the Dalmatian needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dalmatian puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Dalmatians are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dalmatians will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Dalmatians, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hereditary deafness is inherited as a polygenic trait and all Dalmatian bloodlines can pass along deafness to their offspring. Approximately eight percent of Dalmatians are born completely deaf and 22 to 24 percent are born with hearing in one ear only. All puppies are born with their ears closed. The ears should open by 12 to 16 days of age. In Dalmatians, the deafness is characterized by the permanent deterioration by the age of six weeks of the organs of Corti, the nerve cell group inside the cochlea that detect sound. Homemade hearing tests such as stomping on the floor, banging pans together are unreliable because the deaf puppy can feel the vibrations and often learns to adapt very well. The only reliable scientific test is the BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response). This is not available in all areas but is available at most large specialty practices and teaching hospitals at veterinary schools. It can be done any time after the puppy is five weeks old. Dogs that are used for breeding should have been tested for deafness, and many breeders test puppies before they are sent to their new homes. Urolithiasis: The Dalmatian has a unique urinary tract system which makes them susceptible to the formation of urinary tract stones (Urolithiasis). The urine of a Dalmatian contains uric acid instead of urea or allantoin. Stones are formed from the salts of the uric acid. Large stones will lodge in the urethra; small stones also called gravel may pass with the urine. If the urinary tract becomes completely blocked and the condition is not treated promptly it will be fatal. Dalmatians must have adequate water at all times and dietary management with food that is not high in purines can be helpful. You can ask your vet to check your dogs" urine at regular intervals for urate crystals. There is a lot of research being done in this area so new treatment and management protocols are always being developed. Discuss this with your vet. Skin allergies: Many Dalmatians suffer from skin allergies. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies. Hip dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Iris Sphincter Dysplasia: an inherited ocular disorder that can cause sensitivity to bright light, poor night vision, partial or total blindness, and cataracts. At this point it is not frequently seen in Dalmatians although some studies argue that it is often overlooked. The condition and its treatments are being studied.
The Dalmatian is a very active dog and needs plenty of exercise. He"s a fast runner with a great deal of stamina. If left to his own devices a Dalmatian will head cross country on a jaunt that could last several days, so always exercise him on leash or in a secure area. Dalmatians thrive with human companionship and do not do well if relegated to the backyard. They should have plenty of time with their family or they will pine.Because of his unique uric acid metabolism, it"s important to observe whether your Dalmatian is urinating regularly. For the same reason, be sure to provide him with easy access to fresh water all the time.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Dalmatian, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The distinctive Dalmatian coat is lovely to touch, being short, satiny, and fine. The tops of their heads feel almost like velvet. The base color is white with well-defined dense black or deep brown (liver-colored) round spots that vary from dime size to half dollar size evenly distributed over the coat. Expect to see smaller spots on the legs, head, and tail. Spotted ears add the perfect touch. (Where the Dalmatian"s spots came from is a mystery. It"s thought that they may have been caused by a mutation in the ticking gene.)Dalmatian puppies are born pure white, and the spots appear as they age. The exception is puppies born with patches, solid masses of dense, brilliant black or liver-colored hair with no white hair. Patches are appreciably larger than normal-size spots, and they have smooth, sharply defined edges.Large color masses formed by overlapping or intermingled spots are not the same as patches. You can tell the difference because these masses have uneven edges or white hairs scattered throughout. Dalmatians with patches aren"t right for the show ring, but they make perfectly fine family companions or performance dogs.You may also see tricolor Dalmatians: dogs with tan markings on the head, neck, chest, leg, or tail of a black or liver spotted dog. Like patched Dalmatians, they aren"t suited to be show dogs, but nothing stops them from being excellent companion dogs.Dalmatians are clean dogs with little or no "doggy" odor, and their coats are dirt-repellent. It"s not unusual for these dogs to roll around in the mud and then dry to a gleaming shine.Be aware, however, that they shed year-round. A common joke among people with Dalmatians is that they shed only two different times: during the day and during the night. Expect to brush your Dalmatian weekly with a medium-soft rubber curry brush to get the hair off the dog before it lands on your clothes and furniture.With regular brushing, it shouldn"t be necessary to bathe your Dalmatian more than three or four times a year. More frequent bathing removes essential oils from the coat and skin and can make them dry and flaky.Brush your Dalmatian"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.If your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally, trim his nails once or twice a month to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Dalmatian to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Just about every kid recognizes a Dalmatian on sight. His love of activity makes the Dalmatian a great playmate for older children, but his rambunctious nature and swishing tail may be overwhelming to toddlers and young children. With early socialization, Dalmatians can get along fine with other dogs and cats.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Dalmatians are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Dalmatians in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Dalmatian rescue. Dalmatian Rescue of Colorado, Inc.

The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small dog with a unique appearance and the distinction of being the only dog named after a fictional character. This low-to-the-ground dog, with a body that is longer than he is tall and a distinctive "poof" of hair on his head, had been bred for many years before he gained fame and a name in Sir Walter Scott"s book Guy Mannering, published in 1814. In that book, a farmer is portrayed as having six small, long terriers — three with a salt-and-pepper coloring and three with a "mustard" tone to their coats. The farmer"s name was Dandie Dinmont and so the little dogs came to be known as Dandie Dinmont"s terriers, with the apostrophe "s" being dropped as time went by. Even the color designations of the breed came from this fictional farmer. He had only two names for his small dogs: Pepper and Mustard. He differentiated them by calling them Auld Pepper, Auld Mustard, Young Pepper, Young Mustard, Little Pepper and Little Mustard. To this day the two colors of the breed are still known as Pepper (bluish black) and Mustard (shades of golden brown). In his book, Scott, who owned some Dandies of his own, described the little dogs as follows: "He evolved from the Scottish Hillside, the grey mists forming his body, a bunch of lichen his topknot, crooked juniper stems his forelegs and a wet bramble his nose." Dandie Dinmonts are unusual looking dogs that unfortunately are becoming rare. They have large, domed heads, with large, dark eyes that are set low in the front of the head. Their long ears are set low on the skull and fringed at their tips. Dandies have large chests and long backs. Unlike most terriers, Dandies have many curves in their shape. The back arches over the loin (the back end) and drops slightly to the base of the tail, which itself curves like a scimitar. Their front legs are short and powerful with paws that turn slightly outward for digging. The hind legs are slightly longer than the front legs, and not as heavy. They typically are 8 to 11 inches tall and weigh 18 to 24 pounds. Dandies are affectionate, lively dogs. Like many terriers, they also are independent and determined. They are very intelligent and typically are bold in defending their territory and family, but reserved with strangers, at least initially. Many describe them as being dignified, and even 100 years ago, they were described as having "melancholy eyes as of a nobleman in disguise." Dandies typically get along well with children and other pets, so long as they are brought up with them or exposed to them in puppyhood. Although their exercise needs are not great, you should always keep them on a leash in unfenced areas, as their instincts to chase game might kick in at an unexpected moment. Training your Dandie will take a bit of patience. They seem to get bored with repetitive tasks. Make training fun for your Dandie, and you"ll be amazed at how quickly he learns and how clever he truly is.
If your Dandie Dinmont Terrier becomes overweight, he can have back problems. Be sure to monitor his food intake and give him regular exercise to keep him in shape. Dandie Dinmonts are independent and can be stubborn when it comes to housetraining. Crate training is recommended. Dandies are reserved with strangers and make good watchdogs. Their bark is surprisingly loud and deep, but being a typically reserved breed, they can be trained to be quiet on command. Because they are terriers, they are prone to chasing rabbits, birds, and even other dogs and cats. Be sure to keep your Dandie on leash when he"s not in a secure area. Because of their unusual looks and small size, they could be targets for dog thieves. Although Dandies do well outdoors, they should be kept in your house when you can"t supervise them. Dandie Dinmonts are a rare breed. It may be difficult to locate a reputable breeder, and even when you locate one, you may have to wait several months for a litter to be born. While Dandies typically aren"t aggressive dogs, they will not back down from a challenge from other dogs, no matter what their size. Be sure to keep your Dandie under control until you know that both he and the other dog are friendly to each other. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
There are records of Dandie Dinmont Terriers being bred in the early 1700s, but stories about how the breed was developed are conflicting. Some think they were a cross between Otterhounds and local terriers in the Border Country between Scotland and England. Others think the breed evolved from the rough-haired terriers common on farms. Yet others believe the breed was developed by crossing terriers with Dachshunds (although it"s unclear how the Dachshunds, being developed in Germany, would have been in the same proximity as the terriers). Whichever theory one wants to believe, the fact is that Dandies are one of the oldest distinct breeds of terriers. Unlike many breeds, the Dandie hasn"t changed much since the early 1700s. Today"s Dandie Dinmonts certainly resemble the one depicted in Gainsborough"s 1770 portrait of Henry, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch, although a number of other breeds also have claims to being the dog depicted with the duke. Although Dandies were well-established and bred true to type for many years, they didn"t have a unique name until Sir Walter Scott mentioned them in his book, Guy Mannering, which was published in 1814. Before then, terriers of all types were simply called terriers. As an owner of several Dandies himself, Scott described them in his book as being owned by a farmer named Dandie Dinmont. From that book, the breed became known as Dandie Dinmont"s Terriers, with the apostrophe and the "s" being dropped as years went by. Dandies are said to be the first of the terriers to be given their own name. In 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club was formed in Scotland, and the standard for the Dandie Dinmont Terrier was written. This club today is the third oldest breed club in the world. At their first meeting, many breeders disagreed about the correct size of the breed. At the time, Dandies ranged in weight from less than 10 pounds (used to hunt weasels and other small burrowing animals) to more than 40 pounds (used for hunting otters, foxes, and badgers). A compromise was made and the breed standard — a written description of how the breed should look — called for Dandies to range between 14 and 24 pounds. In the 1920s, this was amended to 18 to 24 pounds. Otherwise, the standard remained the same in England and other parts of the world as it was on the day that it was written in 1876 for more than 100 years. In 1987, the British club and many others changed some of the wording of the standard, and throughout the years, the American standard has been modified and revised. Today, the Canadian Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club is the only one in the world that still uses the original standard as its guide. Dandie Dinmont Terriers came to be bred by many people and some have particularly interesting stories, such as Old Pepper, one of the most well known dogs in the history of the breed. Old Pepper was supposedly caught in a trap on the estate of the fifth Duke of Buccleuch. Although his pedigree was unknown, he was bred and sired a son named Old Ginger, whose name can be found in the pedigree of nearly every Dandie Dinmont alive in the world today. Dandie Dinmonts became very popular in England in the late 19th century. Queen Victoria, an avid dog lover, owned a Dandie. It"s not recorded when the first Dandies were brought to the U.S., but the American Kennel Club registered a Dandie named Bonnie Britton in the first year of the Stud Book Registry in 1886. In the years leading up to World War II, there were many large, famous kennels that bred Dandies. During the war, however, many of these kennels were dispersed. Some even destroyed their dogs because there was not enough food to feed them nor enough people available to take care of them. After the war, dedicated breeders worked hard to re-establish the breed. One of the most famous of these kennels was Bellmead Kennels, a large boarding kennel in England. They bred a dog named Bellmead Delegate, who was a significant sire that won many shows. Bellmead continued breeding Dandies until the early 1990s, when the kennel was sold to Battersea Dogs Home. Today the Dandie Dinmont Terrier is one of the rarest and most endangered of all purebred dogs. The Kennel Club in England has put it on their list of endangered native breeds and many fear that it will become extinct.
Dandie Dinmont Terriers are 8 to 11 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh from 18 to 24 pounds. The length of their bodies, from the top of their shoulders to the base of their tails, should be twice their height, minus one to two inches.
Dandies are typical terriers: independent, bold, tenacious, and intelligent. With people they know, they"re affectionate yet dignified but tend to be reserved with strangers. Because Dandies are reserved dogs, they are not "barkers," as are most of their terrier cousins. Dandies will bark when necessary, and their bark is deep and loud. They just don"t seem to think it"s proper to keep barking after the alarm has been duly noted or to bark just to hear their own voices. Like most terriers, Dandies have a great deal of self-confidence. They are not high-strung as are many terriers, however. Nor do they seem to be out looking for a fight, as many terriers do. Dandies are never bullies, but they won"t back down if they are pushed too far. Overall, their motto seems to be "live and let live." Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Dandie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dandie Dinmont puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Dandies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dandies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Dandies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Glaucoma: Some lines of Dandie Dinmont Terriers appear to be prone to glaucoma, which causes an increase in pressure in the eyeball. Signs of glaucoma are squinting, tearing, rubbing, or redness of the eye. If you notice any of these signs, be sure to have your vet check your dog immediately as treatment should be started preferably within a few hours for greatest success. Cheyletiella yasguri mites: While these mites can invest any dog, it appears that Dandie Dinmont Terrier pups and adults become invested with them more commonly than most other breeds of dogs. Signs of these mites are scaliness on the skin, small white Cheyletiella mites moving on the surface of the skin (walking dandruff), itching, skin redness, and small swollen areas. Your vet can prescribe treatments to get rid of the mites. Spinal problems: A Dandie can easily injure his long back. Be careful to support his back when you pick him up and discourage him from jumping on or off high places. Instead, provide pet steps to the sofa or bed. Epilepsy: Some Dandies have been reported with epilepsy. If your dog has seizures, ask your vet about treatment.
Dandie Dinmont Terriers are adaptable and will enjoy city or country life as long as they get quality time with their people. They can live in smaller quarters, although they need to be walked regularly or have a yard to play in. Two 20- or 30-minute walks daily or time spent playing in the yard will keep them happy. Like all terriers, digging is in their blood, so either supervise outdoor playtime or provide them with their very own digging spot. Never allow them off-leash in unfenced areas as their instinct to hunt and chase may be provoked by the slightest movement of a squirrel, bird, or other dog or cat. An underground electronic fence won"t deter them in the least, so stick to a solid barrier. Training your Dandie will take a bit of patience. Like all terriers, Dandies are independent thinkers, and they may often seem reluctant to respond to your commands. They also seem to get bored with repetitive tasks. Make training fun for your Dandie, and you"ll be amazed at how quickly he learns and how clever he truly is.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t feel the ribs, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Dandie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Dandie Dinmont Terriers have a crisp topcoat that covers a soft, downy, waterproof undercoat. The topcoat, which is about 2 inches long, gets its crisp texture from the mixture of two-thirds hard hair with one-third soft hair. The topknot is very soft silky hair. They come in two distinctive colors: mustard and pepper. Mustards are a reddish brown to a pale fawn with a creamy white topknot. Peppers are a dark bluish black to a light silvery gray with a silvery white topknot. Although Dandies look very natural, they actually have medium- to high-maintenance coats. Even though they shed very little, Dandies need to be brushed two or three times a week to remove dead hair and prevent matting. Part of keeping your Dandie well-groomed involves plucking dead hair from the coat once or twice a year. Show dogs require this much more often. The hard hairs are stripped out to encourage new hair to grow. Most pet owners find a good professional groomer to strip their Dandie"s coats. If you cut your Dandie"s hair instead of stripping it, the color and texture changes, becoming lighter and softer. Complete a Dandie"s hair care by trimming the hair on top of the muzzle short, and keeping the corners of the eyes free of hair. The soft furnishings — the long hair on the legs, underbody, and head — can be trimmed with scissors, as can the hair between the footpads. Hair in the ears should be removed regularly by gently plucking it out. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Dandie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Dandie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Dandie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Dandies typically get along well with children and other pets, so long as they are brought up with them or exposed to them in puppyhood. An adult Dandie who"s unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Dandies are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and or fostering. Dandie Dinmont Terrier Rescue Groups

Because the Doberman Pinscher (spelled Dobermann in some countries) came into existence at the end of the 19th century, he is, in the world of dogs, the new kid on the block. This hasn"t stopped the Dobie, as he is affectionately called, from becoming one of the most popular and recognized breeds in the United States. His look is elegant and his style is athletic; the Dobie is also intelligent, alert, and loyal. He is a courageous guard dog as well as a beloved family companion. The Dobie"s fierce reputation precedes him. He is feared by those who don"t know him, stereotyped as highly aggressive and vicious. True, he is a formidable guardian, but he is usually a gentle, watchful, and loving dog. He does not go looking for trouble, but he is fearless and will defend his family and turf if he perceives danger. The Doberman Pinscher enjoys being part of a family. He likes to be close to those he loves and, when this love is present, he is a natural protector. He is trustworthy with his family"s children, friends, and guests as long as he is treated kindly. In spite of his positive qualities, the Dobie isn"t the right breed for everyone. He"s large, at 60 to 80 pounds, and he"s extremely active, both physically and mentally. He needs a lot of exercise. He also needs plenty of mental challenges to keep him from becoming bored. He needs a strong owner/pack leader who can take time to properly socialize and train him, and who will keep him busy every day. This may be too much to handle for people who lead a more laid-back lifestyle. The current look of the Dobie is slimmer and sleeker than that of past years. His temperament has also changed somewhat, say breed enthusiasts, softening a bit from his early days in Germany, though he is still an excellent guard dog. Originally, Dobies" ears were cropped to increase their ability to locate sounds, and tail docking gave the breed a more streamlined look. North American breeders usually dock the tails and crop the ears of Doberman puppies, though it"s not mandatory. Docking and ear cropping is illegal in some countries. Those who know him say that a well-bred and properly socialized Dobie is an excellent pet and companion, suitable for families with other dogs, gentle with young children, and overall a loyal and devoted family member.
The Doberman has a great deal of energy and needs a lot of exercise. This breed can be protective, so don"t be surprised when he assumes the role of household guardian. The Dobie will assume the alpha role in your household if you"re not a strong leader. Early, consistent training is critical to establish your role as pack leader. The Dobie is sensitive to cold weather and needs adequate shelter in winter (he likes to be in the house next to the fireplace). The Doberman Pinscher is a family dog and shouldn"t be left alone. He thrives when he"s included in family activities. The Doberman has gained a reputation as being vicious. Even though your Doberman may have a sweet personality, neighbors and strangers may be afraid of him. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Once upon a time, in the late 19th century, there was a tax collector named Louis Dobermann, who lived in the town of Apolda, in the Thuringia district of Germany. His job of collecting money was dangerous because there were bandits in the area who might attack him as he made his rounds. Since Dobermann was also the town dogcatcher, he often took along a dog for protection. Dobermann began breeding dogs with the idea of a loyal companion and protector in mind. The result of his breeding experiments was the early Doberman Pinscher. There are no records about what dogs Dobermann used to create the breed, but it is speculated that the Rottweiler, German Pinscher, and Black and Tan Terrier are part of the mix. The Dobie was first shown in 1876, where he was met with great enthusiasm. When Dobermann died in 1894, the true knowledge of the breeds that were combined to make the Dobie went with him to his grave. Because of his contributions in developing the breed, however, it was named in his honor. At the end of the 19th century, German breeders who continued Dobermann"s work were primarily concerned with function rather than appearance. They wanted to develop the Doberman to be a "super dog." At first, they bred only the bravest, smartest, quickest, and toughest dogs. They succeeded almost too well — the breed became known for being headstrong and aggressive. A breeder named Otto Goeller is credited with shaping the Doberman into a more usable dog and, in 1900, the German Kennel Club recognized the Dobermann Pinscher as a breed. Around 1908, the Dobie was brought to the United States. Legend says one of the first Dobies brought to Amercia was shown in conformation and won "Best in Show" honors at three consecutive shows before any judge dared to open the dog"s mouth to check his teeth. The Dobermann Pinscher Club of America was formed in 1921. A year later, it adopted the breed standard that had been written in Germany. The next 15 years were critical in the development of the Dobie. During World War I, the number of Dobies in Europe declined severely, because people who were starving couldn"t afford to keep large dogs. Dobies who survived were owned by the military, police, and very wealthy people. Breeding was a luxury; only the very best were bred. After 1921, nearly all the top German sire and progeny were brought to the United States. Then came World War II, and the Doberman Pinscher was again in peril in Germany. Many think that if Americans hadn"t previously brought so many dogs to the United States, the breed would be extinct. In the mid 1900s, the Germans dropped the word Pinscher from the name, and the British dropped it a few years later. Over the years, breeders have worked diligently to take the edge off the original Dobie"s sharp personality — with good results. Although the Doberman is protective of his family and home, he is known as an affectionate and loyal companion.
Males stand 26 to 28 inches tall; females stand 24 to 26 inches tall. Males and females weigh 60 to 80 pounds; males are slightly larger than females.
A super-intelligent and super-active dog — that"s what you get when you get a Doberman Pinscher. You also get an extremely loyal, trustworthy dog who"s playful and fun-loving with his family. He"s a natural protector who won"t hesitate to act when he thinks his family is under threat, but he is not aggressive without reason. The Dobie likes to be busy, physically and mentally. He learns quickly, and training him is easy. Because he learns so fast, it"s challenging to keep lessons fresh and interesting. He can have his own ideas about things, though typically he"s not overly stubborn or willful with an owner who provides consistent, kind leadership. The Dobie takes a while to grow up. He remains puppyish until he is three to four years old. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Dobie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dobie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Dobies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dobies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Dobies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Von Willebrand"s Disease: An inherited blood disorder, this condition interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives, however. A vet can test your dog for the condition; dogs with this condition should not be bred. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that"s thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Wobbler"s Syndrome: Suspected to be an inherited condition in Dobermans, affected dogs suffer from spinal cord compression caused by cervical vertebral instability or from a malformed spinal canal. Extreme symptoms are neck pain and paralysis of the legs. Surgical therapy is hotly debated, because in some cases the condition can recur even after such treatment. Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease of the heart muscle, which becomes thin and weak. It"s characterized by an expansion or widening (dilatation) of the heart chambers, resulting in an abnormally large heart. This disease eventually results in heart failure, since the damaged heart muscle is too weak to efficiently pump blood to the rest of the body. Treatment varies but includes oxygen, fluid therapy, and medication that improves heart function. Albinoism: Albinoism is a genetic condition that affects the Doberman Pinscher. An albino is not just a white dog but a dog with pink skin and nose, and blue or light eyes. Albinos are sensitive to sunlight and can suffer from a variety of health conditions, including cancer and eye problems. Albino dogs should not be bred. Color Mutant Alopecia: This is a condition of the coat associated with blue or fawn coat colors. It affects blue and occasionally red Dobies. Most dogs who develop this condition are born with normal coats; symptoms generally start to show up at four months to three years of age. As the dog grows and matures, he develops brittle hair, followed by patchy hair loss. Only the blue portions of the coat are affected. Secondary infection and inflammation is common. The condition is incurable, although medicated shampoos may help reduce scaling and itching. Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder caused by the brain"s inability to regulate wake-sleep patterns. A dog with narcolepsy may suddenly become sleepy and in fact fall asleep. Research for treatment is underway. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Doberman Pinschers. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.
The Doberman Pinscher is best suited to a suburban or country home with room for him to romp. He needs a lot of exercise every day; this demand can be tiring to owners who aren"t up to the job. He needs a home with a securely fenced yard, for his safety and for the safety of people and animals who inadvertently walk into his turf. He should not be left alone for long periods of time or relegated to the backyard as an outside dog. He should not be chained, either. The Dobie needs to be part of his family, participating in all family activities. The Dobie needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he isn"t properly socialized when he"s still young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Dobie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young. Ear cropping, however, is the owner"s responsibility, not the breeder"s, and it"s done by a veterinarian when the puppy is a few months old. It requires surgery and several months of care afterward. If you like the look of cropped ears, consider the care and expense as well. The public reaction to the Dobie is often one of fear. It"s wise to be sensitive to this, and keep your Dobie leashed in public places.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Dobie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Dobie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The sleek, smooth Dobie coat is short and lies close to the skin. He may have a slight undercoat around the neck. His coat colors are black, red, blue, and fawn. He has rust markings above each eye; on his muzzle, throat, and chest; and on his legs and feet. The Dobie"s sleek coat requires minimal grooming. He is a clean dog, with minimal doggie odor. Don"t be fooled by his coat length — the short coat does shed. Weekly brushing with a grooming mitt or rubber curry is sufficient, however, as is a bath when the Dobie rolls in something that smells bad or plays in the mud. Frequent bathing, however, isn"t necessary. Brush your Dobie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Dobie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The well-bred Doberman is a wonderful family dog. He is trustworthy and protective of the children in his family, as long as he"s been socialized and trained appropriately. Children must be respectful and kind to the Dobie, and he will be just that in return. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He"s also friendly with other dogs and animals in his home, especially if he has been raised with them. He can be aggressive toward dogs outside his family if he considers them a threat to his loved ones.
Dobies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Dobies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Dobie rescue.

The large, muscular Dogo Argentino was bred for strength and big-game hunting, especially for bringing down wild boars. Despite its capability for aggression when it comes to hunting, the Dogo Argentino generally has a happy disposition, and it is fiercely loyal to its human family. This breed"s strength requires a firm, active trainer who is capable of keeping big dogs in line, and they need strict boundaries. A tall, strong fence for the yard is a must, or else the Dogo Argentino"s prey drive can lead them to chase small animals or wander. Socialization with other humans and pets is also key to keeping the Dogo Argentino"s natural caution around strangers and other animals in check. Dogo Argentinos need to stay active, or they may become bored and prone to destructive behavior. They should not be left alone for long periods of time. With the right training and a good, loving home, the Dogo Argentino can make a courageous and dedicated family companion, as well as an excellent watchdog.
Although it was bred from fighting dogs, its aggressive traits were bred out so that it could cooperate with other dogs during hunts. It is not natural for them to want to fight, but some people train them to do so anyway because of their strength and courageous nature. Because they are used in dog fighting rings, Dogo Argentinos have been deemed dangerous and banned in several countries, including Australia, the Cayman Islands, Denmark, Fiji, Iceland, Singapore, and Ukraine. In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to own one without lawful authority. Dogo Argentinos are sometimes used for work with the police, military, and search and rescue efforts. The breed is beloved for its loyalty and courage--qualities that make them excellent watchdogs. About 10 percent of Dogo Argentinos suffer from pigment-related deafness in one or both ears, which is an affliction that often affects dogs that have white coats. Socialization and early training are important for keeping the Dogo Argentino well-behaved. They are physically strong and strong-willed, so they need a firm trainer that can keep them in line without resorting to force or physical punishment. They are not a breed for novice owners. This breed is often confused with the American Bulldog, though it is taller and has a white coat. It may also be confused with the American Pit Bull Terrier, though the Dogo Argentino is much larger and is different in many ways.
The Dogo Argentino is a descendant of the now-extinct Fighting Dog of Cordoba, a large, fierce dog bred for, as the name implies, fighting. A man named Antonio Nores Martinez from Argentina wanted a fearless hunting dog that could handle the terrain of his homeland, as well as being a loyal companion. In the 1920s, Martinez began to use selective breeding and aimed to reduce the dog"s desire to fight so it could cooperate in a pack, and he worked to replace the fighting instinct with the need to hunt. Several breeds were mixed to achieve the desired traits that are seen in the Dogo Argentino breed. Martinez created a trustworthy companion dog with a strong prey drive and muscular build, ideal for hunting in the rugged terrain of Argentina or being a loyal family guardian. Sadly, the breed is still sometimes used in dog fighting rings because of its strength and fearless nature.
Dogo Argentinos are large dogs that grow to a standard height of about 24 to 27 inches at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly taller than females by about an inch on average. The breed usually weighs between 80 and 100 pounds. The body is usually slightly longer than it is tall, and Dogo Argentinos have large, broad heads that make them resemble the American Bulldog or the American Pit Bull Terrier. Although these sizes are considered "breed standard," some Dogo Argentinos may be quite a bit bigger or smaller.
The Dogo Argentino is a loyal breed with a tendency to be highly territorial, making them excellent watchdogs. They are fierce defenders of their human families, even children, though their strong prey drive makes them poor companions for other animals like cats or smaller dogs. That prey drive does, however, make them great hunters, able to take down wild boars with their ferocity and strength.They are independent dogs that need an experienced owner to handle their training needs, especially when it comes to socialization, as the Dogo Argentino is known for being less than welcoming to strangers and other dogs. They are strong-willed and need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, so apartment living isn"t the ideal situation for them. It is best to begin their training early as puppies.
The Dogo Argentino is predisposed to a few health problems. One of the major issues is deafness, with about 10 percent of dogs in the breed being deaf in one or both ears. This is called pigment-related deafness, and is found in other mostly-white colored dogs, including Dalmatians, white Boxers, and white Bull Terriers.The breed may develop other conditions, including hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and laryngeal paralysis. Dogo Argentinos may also suffer from hip dysplasia, which is common among large breeds.
It is important to provide Dogo Argentinos with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, as they may become bored, anxious, and destructive if their needs are not met. As with dogs of any breed, you should keep up with regular vet checkups, keep their teeth clean, and groom them as needed. They should have their ears checked weekly and their nails trimmed monthly. Ask your veterinarian about your individual dog"s needs and make sure you keep up with at-home care.
Dogo Argentinos will need a diet formulated for large breed dogs with plenty of fresh, clean water. They are a fairly high-energy breed, which should also be taken into account. Feeding needs will change from puppyhood into adulthood. The best way to create an appropriate feeding plan for your individual Dogo Argentino is to speak to your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist about their needs. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance.
The Dogo Argentino has a short, all-white coat, though there is sometimes a black spot on the head. Though the coat is short and fairly easy to maintain, the size of the Dogo Argentino makes the grooming process a little more difficult. Dogo Argentinos should be brushed weekly and bathed every three months or sooner if they get dirty. They will shed a fair amount, but the length of their coat makes this a little bit less noticeable than long-haired breeds. Still, you"d do well to have a lint roller on hand.
Dogo Argentinos are very loyal to their families, including children, so long as they are introduced and accustomed to their presence. However, visiting children may present a bit more of a challenge, as this breed does not naturally take to strangers. Children should always be supervised with dogs, even when they are family, and they should be trained on how to interact with animals to avoid incidents. Socializing Dogo Argentinos early and training them to interact with new people and animals will help, and the earlier training begins, the better.Dogo Argentinos have a high prey drive, which can cause trouble when it comes to smaller pets, including cats and other dogs. They may learn to interact with these animals if they are trained and socialized properly, but this breed is best suited to a home that has no other pets or only has other large dogs.

The DDB, as he"s nicknamed, originated in France"s Bordeaux region 600 or more years ago. He"s known for his massive head, fearless temperament, and powerful body. The Dogue de Bordeaux first came to the attention of the American public with the 1989 release of the Tom Hanks movie Turner and Hooch and has gained popularity ever since. A devoted and affectionate family dog, he has a reputation for being sweet and docile, but he can also be stubborn and arrogant. Patient, consistent training is a must, as is early and extensive socialization to prevent aggression toward other animals and unwarranted aggression toward strangers. Loyal, self-assured, and territorial, he"s a superb guard dog who"s also capable of competing in many sports and activities, including carting, obedience, therapy work, tracking, and search and rescue.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  21 to 25 inchesWeight:  50 to 70 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
Dutch Shepherds haven"t changed much since their days on Netherlands farms over a century ago, but why fix what isn"t broken? This breed is prized for its intelligence and its trainable nature. Today, they serve as police dogs, guides for the blind, obedience competition competitors, and family companions, and they still haven"t lost their ability to herd, though there"s less demand for that in modern times. Dutch Shepherds make excellent family dogs that are great with kids and other pets, though they need an active environment that will keep them mentally and physically stimulated, or they may get bored and destructive. They are capable of apartment living, so long as they get at least one long walk and several play sessions during the day. Early socialization will help them keep calm around new pets and people. The Dutch Shepherd"s coat keeps them comfortable in both hot and cold weather, though their skin and coat will need some attention if they live in a dry climate. Tend to the Dutch Shepherd"s exercise needs and provide them with confident training, and you"ll have a loving, obedient best friend for life.
The Dutch Shepherd comes in three coats--short hair, long hair, and wire hair. Short haired Dutch Shepherds are the most commonly used for police work, and wire haired Dutch Shepherds are quite rare in general. Originally, the main thing that separated Dutch Shepherds from German Shepherds or Belgian Shepherds was coat color. All three breeds have gained more distinguishing features and breed standards since then. Dutch Shepherds were almost pushed to the brink of extinction after World War II when breeding in the Netherlands was stopped and many dogs were taken for service in the German military. Unlike other shepherd dogs, Dutch Shepherds have relatively few health problems. The Dutch Shepherd is an excellent watchdog and very loyal to their families. They are not known to be overly vocal, but they will bark if a stranger enters their territory. The coat of the Dutch Shepherd is brindle with colors that range from sandy gold to red chestnut. Too much black or white in the fur is seen as a fault.
The Dutch Shepherd, as you might imagine, started out as a shepherd"s working dog. Dutch Shepherds were used for all kinds of tasks on farms in the Dutch countryside. Not only were they capable of herding sheep and other livestock, but they also kept chickens out of the gardens, pulled carts, and acted as watchdogs. Originally, there was very little to distinguish Dutch Shepherds from German Shepherds or Belgian Shepherds other than coat color, although the breeds have diverged a bit more in the past 100 years and have their own breed standards. The Dutch Shepherd has become more rare in modern times. The development of modern farming techniques made these dogs unnecessary for herding and other farm work, and during World War II, breeding in the Netherlands stopped. Many dogs died of starvation, and some were taken by the German military because they were highly trainable for work in the armed forces. After the war, breeders continued the effort of breeding Dutch Shepherds and mixed in dogs of unknown origin. Though the breed is still rare today, Dutch Shepherds are used for police work, search and rescue, and as guide dogs because they are so highly trainable. They also compete in dog sports and have retained their herding abilities from their days on the farms.
Male Dutch Shepherds are slightly larger on average than females, standing at 22 to 25 inches, while females come in at around 21 to 24 inches. The breed tends to grow to about 50 to 70 pounds in weight. While these are considered standard sizes, some individuals in the breed may be larger or smaller.
Dutch Shepherds are known for their intelligence and all-around competency in just about everything, including agility, acting as watchdogs, search and rescue, herding, field training, police work, guide dog duty, and just being a family companion. They are highly trainable and eager to please, soaking up new commands like a sponge. This breed requires a confident trainer who can set boundaries, keep dogs interested in learning, and build a trusting relationship. Early socialization training is important and will help them stay calm around new people and pets. The Dutch Shepherd is an excellent watchdog and usually barks when a stranger enters their territory. This can be beneficial, but it is also important for dogs to learn to interact with guests appropriately. Dutch Shepherds are great with family, even children and other pets, and they are very affectionate and obedient. They will, however, need plenty of exercise, both mentally and physically, to keep from becoming bored and destructive.
Dutch Shepherds are generally a very healthy breed. There are some instances of Dutch Shepherds developing hip dysplasia, but these instances are more rare than in similar breeds, such as German Shepherds.
As with all dogs, you should take your Dutch Shepherd for regular veterinary check-ups and keep up with any at-home care recommended by your veterinarian. Dutch Shepherds" nails grow fairly quickly and will need to be trimmed as needed to avoid cracking, splitting, or injury. Their ears should also be checked at least weekly and cleared of any debris or wax buildup, as this can lead to infection. The teeth should also be brushed regularly. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how to perform these care basics for your dog. It is important to make sure that you keep up with your Dutch Shepherd"s daily exercise needs. They"ll need at least one good, long walk per day, and maybe some vigorous play sessions. If they are not mentally and physically stimulated, they may become bored, anxious, and destructive.
A Dutch Shepherd"s diet should be formulated for an active, mid-to-large size dog with somewhat high energy levels. You should ask your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on which foods and portions are best for your individual dog. You should also discuss adding fish oil supplements to their diet, as this can help keep their coat shiny and their skin healthy.
The Dutch Shepherd comes in three different coats--short hair, wire hair (also called rough hair), and long hair. The short hair has a woolly undercoat. Wire hair also has a woolly undercoat and is very dense and course. The long hair is straight and a bit harsh to the touch. All of these coats keep the Dutch Shepherd comfortable in most types of weather. They are generally brindle with various shades of gold and silver. Some can be a light, sandy color while others can be a shade of red. Too much black or white in the coat is usually seen as a fault. When it comes to grooming, the short and long haired coats need regular brushing to remove loose or dead hairs, especially from the undercoat. The wire haired coat should be groomed by a professional twice a year and should not be brushed, though it can be combed from time to time. Dutch Shepherds should be bathed as needed, as it removes the skin"s natural oils.
Dutch Shepherds are quite loyal to their families, including children. They tend to love humans that they are familiar with and will only bark or act standoffish to strangers, which makes them excellent watchdogs. Children should, of course, be supervised when playing with Dutch Shepherds, as they should with any dog, to make sure that playtime doesn"t get out of hand. Children should also be trained on how to handle animals properly to avoid incident. Dutch Shepherds are also usually fine with other dogs and pets. Starting socialization training early can help Dutch Shepherds" natural friendliness and make sure they stay calm with new people and animals.

What"s the difference between an English Cocker and a Cocker Spaniel, you say? Not very long ago, American and English Cockers were considered to be the same breed. The decision to classify them as separate breeds was made in the 1930s when it became evident that Cocker Spaniels in the U.S. were different than ones in England. One difference is size. The English Cocker Spaniel is larger than the American Cocker Spaniel. They also have different body types. And unlike the American Cocker, the English Cocker is likely to be found in the field alongside his cousins the Field Spaniel and the English and Welsh Springer Spaniels. The engaging English Cocker is happy and affectionate. He"s a sturdy dog with a long, square muzzle, expressive eyes, long ears that reach the tip of his nose when pulled forward, and a docked tail. The English Cocker has a medium-length coat, although the English Cockers you see in the field have a shorter coat than those in the show ring. They are 14 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 26 and 34 pounds. As sporting dogs, English Cockers have a lot of stamina and energy. They"re also curious dogs and like to investigate things. English Cocker Spaniels are excellent retrievers with delicate mouths who hunt well in difficult terrain. While English Cockers are intelligent, they can be stubborn at times, especially if they don"t see a good reason for doing what you want them to do. Obedience training is a good idea with any dog, but with hunting dogs in particular, you need to train them to come when called and to obey your commands. Because they are so affectionate toward their people, it"s important to use gentle, consistent training that won"t break your dog"s spirit. Training also helps keep your English Cocker mentally stimulated. This is a dog that loves to learn. An English Cocker"s talents aren"t limited to the field. He can also do well in tracking, obedience trials, flyball, and agility. Because English Cockers are very people-oriented, they thrive on being around their families and can become destructive if left alone frequently with no companionship or activity. They get along well with children and make good companions for people of all ages. While they are alert and will bark at noises, don"t expect them to be effective guard dogs. They are far too friendly for that kind of work and most likely will end up licking the hands of any strangers they encounter, all the while wagging their tails.
English Cocker Spaniels can be difficult to housetrain. Crate-training is recommended. Some English Cockers bark a lot. English Cockers are eager to please and like to be close to their families. But they are hunting dogs and might start chasing birds or small animals when outside. Be sure to keep your English Cocker on a leash whenever you aren"t in a fenced area. Teach him to come to you when you call. Cockers have a "soft" personality. Harsh training methods may make them fearful or shut down altogether. Be sure to use gentle, consistent training to get the best results. If your English Cocker doesn"t get enough exercise, he may become obese and destructive. An English Cocker Spaniel"s long ears are susceptible to ear infections. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Spaniels of varying sizes have been around for centuries. There are references to spaniels as far back as the works of Chaucer and Shakespeare. Spaniels come in two types: land spaniels and water spaniels. English Cockers are members of the land spaniel family. They take their name from the job they performed, which was to hunt woodcock, a type of gamebird. Until the past century, it wasn"t unusual for a single litter of spaniels to have puppies of different sizes. Breeders would decide what use the puppies in their litters seemed most suited for, depending upon their size, muscle, intelligence, and stamina. Toward the end of the 19th century, however, British breeders began dividing the spaniels into specific breeds: English Springer, Welsh Springer, Cocker, Field, Sussex, Clumber, and Irish Water Spaniel. All spaniels that weighed less than 25 pounds were classified as Cocker Spaniels. There was some dispute, however, over some of the weight designations, so eventually it was decided that type should be more important than weight in determining the breed of the dog. In 1885, England"s Spaniel Club was formed. One of the club"s first tasks was to create breed standards for each of the different spaniel types. On the other side of the pond, the development of Cockers took a different direction. American breeders selected for smaller dogs with a more rounded skull, shorter muzzle, and heavier coat. By 1935, it was clear that American and English Cocker Spaniels were two very different types. The English Cocker Spaniel Club of America was formed in 1936, and the American Kennel Club recognized the two varieties as separate breeds in 1946, with one being called the English Cocker Spaniel, the other the Cocker Spaniel. Although the American Cocker Spaniel became very popular in the U.S., the English Cocker is one of the most popular breeds in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., its relative lack of popularity has helped the breed to remain healthy and true to its roots as a hunting dog and pleasurable companion. The English Cocker Spaniel is currently ranked 74th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Male English Cocker Spaniels stand 16 to 17 inches tall and weigh 28 to 34 pounds. Females are 15 to 16 inches tall and weigh 26 to 32 pounds.
The English Cocker is described as merry and affectionate with an equable disposition. He"s playful, trainable, and friendly toward people (although sometimes reserved with strangers) and other dogs. English Cockers will bark to let you know someone"s approaching, so they"re good watchdogs, but as typical spaniels they"ll happily show the burglar where the silver is. Like every dog, English Cocker Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Cocker puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
English Cockers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all English Cockers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In English Cockers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Eye problems: Cockers are prone to a variety of eye problems, including Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that progresses to blindness; cataracts, a cloudy film that forms over the eye; glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside the eyeball; and eye abnormalities. If you notice any redness in your Cocker"s eyes, or if he starts rubbing his face a lot, take him to the vet for a checkup. Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment, and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Cockers may be able to lead normal, healthy lives, although you will have to monitor their exercise and not allow them to overdo it. In severe cases, your Cocker may require hip replacement surgery to get around easily. Renal Failure: Failure of the kidneys at a young age (between the ages of 9 and 24 months) occurs occasionally and is thought to be inherited. Congenital Sensorineural Deafness: This is a condition that is currently found only in parti-colored English Cockers. This condition is present at birth for affected puppies with degeneration of their hearing progressing to deafness by the age of 4 weeks. Some English Cocker breeders are beginning to test dogs for deafness before breeding them. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes overly distended. It appears to affect primarily solid-colored English Cockers. Signs include weight loss, weakness, abdominal distention, coughing, fainting, and a rapid heart beat. Diagnosis is made with x-rays and echocardiography.
English Cocker Spaniels are adaptable and can even do well living in an apartment as long as they receive daily exercise to keep them in shape. This is a breed with a great deal of stamina, so he"ll enjoy long, brisk walks, games of fetch, or sports such as agility or flyball. Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your English Cocker pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Teach your English Cocker with a gentle hand. He has a sensitive spaniel temperament and won"t respond well to harshness. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play. He"s a fast learner, and if you make training consistent and fun, you"ll be more than pleased with his abilities. Like all dogs, English Cockers have a mischievous side. They"re also chowhounds. Keep food and garbage out of reach, as well as anything else you don"t want them to get into, especially during the curious puppy period. A crate is a great way to prevent your English Cocker from getting into trouble when you"re not around to supervise.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. English Cockers like to eat, and they will put on the pounds if you"re not careful. Keep your English Cocker in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your English Cocker, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
English Cocker Spaniels have medium-long coats that are flat or slightly wavy, with a silky texture. The legs, chest, and belly are covered with longer hair called feathering, but not as much as that of their cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel. Feathering is more than decorative; it helps to protect the dog"s body from scratches or other injuries as he makes his way through the field. English Cockers come in coats of many colors. Among them are parti-color (white with black, liver, or shades of red); solid black, liver, or shades of red; black and tan; and liver and tan. Any of the colors or patterns may come with tan points on the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, rump, and feet. Of all the English Cocker colors, blue roan is most popular. Brush your English Cocker"s coat every other day and any time he"s been in the field. You can trim the feathering so it doesn"t drag on the ground and the feet so they look neat. The coat of an English Cocker show dog requires more effort. It must be stripped by hand or with a stripping knife. If you plan to show your English Cocker, you"ll want to apprentice with a breeder to learn how to groom the coat properly. Clean the ears weekly with a cleanser recommended by the dog"s breeder or veterinarian. Because the ears hang down, they"re prone to ear infections. When you clean them, check for signs of infections, such as a bad smell, redness, tenderness, or itchiness. If your English Cocker frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear, take him to the vet for a checkup. When it comes to ear infections, it"s best to start treatment as soon as possible. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better if you want to keep your English Cocker"s mouth healthy. Trim the nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails will help keep your dog"s foot in good condition and will prevent them from scratching your legs when your English Cocker enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your English Cocker to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
English Cockers are friendly, fun-loving, and gentle family dogs who do well with children, especially if they"re brought up with them. Adult English Cockers who aren"t familiar with children may do best in a home with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. English Cockers enjoy the company of other dogs and can also get along fine with cats, especially if they"re introduced at an early age.

Although most of us have never seen one in person, movies, books, and cartoons have familiarized us with the image of a pack of English Foxhounds in hot pursuit of a red fox. Wearing the familiar tricolor coat of black, white and tan, they have hanging ears that lie close to their cheeks, and a long tail — known as the stern and carried up — that tapers to a point. A description of Belvoir Gambler, recognized as the greatest English Foxhound ever bred, says, "Next to an old Greek statue, there are few such combinations of grace and strength as a fine Foxhound." This rare breed has never made the leap to popular companion dog, but he is certainly a dog to consider if you"re a jogger or runner or would like a canine friend to accompany you on horseback rides. This intelligent, courageous hound can cover long distances without a break. Foxhunters prize him for his stamina, good nose, and determination. Those characteristics have pros and cons for people who are interested in him as a companion. For example, his stamina and determination make him a good pal for marathon runners, but his powerful scenting ability can make him desirous of following an interesting trail rather than going where you want. He needs daily exercise, so he"s not a good choice for the weekend warrior. And being a hound, whose job it is to go after prey, he must be kept on leash in areas where he could run in front of a car. On the up side, he"s gentle, social, and tolerant, making him a good family dog for people with an active lifestyle who have plenty of time to devote to keeping him busy. Because of his high energy level, he"s not really suited to apartment life. He needs a daily exercise partner and a large fenced yard or, better yet, an acreage where he can run. English Foxhounds are working dogs. If you are looking for an English Foxhound as simply a companion, seek out one that has been bred for the show ring rather than for hunting. He"ll have a little less energy and drive than a field dog.
English Foxhounds need a large fenced yard and daily exercise of 30 to 60 minutes per day. English Foxhounds are not recommended for apartment living. They are an active breed indoors, which makes them unsuitable for small dwellings. Before you purchase your English Foxhound, research the breed and to talk to breeders. The English Foxhound is not the breed for everyone, and because the information about him is limited it is easy to purchase this breed while failing to properly understand its limitations and idiosyncrasies. English Foxhounds need a strong owner who is fair and consistent. Obedience training is a must and should begin at an early age. This breed does well with children, but English Foxhounds are quite active and bouncy when they are young. For that reason, they are not recommended for homes with small children. Being pack dogs, English Foxhounds do well with other dogs and actually do better in homes where there are other dogs. They can become bored and destructive when they are the only dog in the home. English Foxhounds are a rare breed and it may be difficult to find a responsible breeder. Breeders with puppies available may have a long waiting list. Bred to pursue prey, the English Foxhound still possesses this drive. For this reason, they should have a fenced yard and should be walked on leash as they may not come back if they are in pursuit of something interesting. The English Foxhound generally does well with other animals in the home, but it is important to understand that they are prey driven and may chase smaller animals. English Foxhounds have a loud bark. This makes them wonderful watchdogs, but it may also make them unliked by neighbors. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The English Foxhound was developed in England to pursue the red fox. He has been listed in studbooks published by the British Masters of Foxhounds Association since the 18th century. During their history, there have been more than 250 packs of English Foxhounds in Great Britain. The breed has been in America for at least as long as it has existed. Lord Fairfax brought the first pack to this country in 1738, and those dogs contributed to the development of the American Foxhound. The two breeds differ in that the English Foxhounds tends to be stouter than his sleek American cousin. Today, the English Foxhound is the least common dog registered by the American Kennel Club.
The English Foxhound generally stands 23 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 55 to 75 pounds. Males are larger than females.
English Foxhounds have the typical independent — some might say stubborn — hound personality. They do best with people who provide firm and consistent training. Training should begin at a young age and should continue through all levels of puppy development. Puppy socialization classes are very good for all breeds, and the English Foxhound is no exception. Obedience training may take some time and patience, but in the end you are left with an excellent companion dog, except in the case of the come command. English Foxhounds should be leash trained and should be kept on lead whenever they are out of a securely fenced area. They will pursue "prey" heedless of any commands their owners give. English Foxhounds have a baying bark that they are happy to demonstrate for everyone, including strangers they see approaching their home. In that sense they make good watchdogs, but despite a natural distrust of strangers, they are easygoing hounds and don"t really have the protective nature of a guard dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the English Foxhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Foxhounds puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
English Foxhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Foxhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Foxhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: a degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds of dogs. Although it is a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can occur in a puppy with parents free of the disease. When that happens, it is usually linked to environmental conditions such as poor nutrition or putting on too much weight at an early age. Renal Disease: Also known as kidney disease, it occurs when the kidneys are unable to clear the blood of certain toxins such as creatinine and urea. Epilepsy: The English Foxhound can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medications, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.
Bred to be a fast hunter with a great deal of stamina, the English Foxhound requires a substantial amount of exercise. If he can"t hunt in a field as he was bred to do, take him on daily runs or provide other exercise that will help him burn off his natural energy. He"s used to kennel life and can live outdoors if accompanied by another social dog and provided with appropriate shelter. If he"s an only dog, however, he should live indoors with his human pack so he won"t get lonely. It is important to crate train your English Foxhound puppy. Puppies explore, get into things they shouldn"t, and chew things that can harm them. It can be expensive both in fixing or replacing destroyed items as well as the vet bills that could arise. Crate training ensures not only the safety of your puppy but also of your belongings.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Foxhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
English Foxhounds have a shiny, short, dense coat with a hard texture. They usually come in a tricolor pattern of black, white, and tan, but they can also be white with hare (more tan than black and white, giving the look of a hare), badger (a mixture of white, gray, brown, and black hairs), tan, or yellow. A weekly brushing with a rough cloth or hound mitt removes loose hair. Like all dogs, English Foxhounds shed, but regular brushing will keep hairfall to a minimum. Check his ears, eyes, mouth, and skin for any sores or infections while you are grooming. Regular brushing should keep your English Foxhound clean. There"s no need to bathe him unless he"s dirty or smelly. Use a high-quality dog shampoo to avoid drying out the skin and coat. Wipe the outer ear canal with a cotton swab or ball, but don"t insert anything into the ear canal. Start grooming your English Foxhound puppy when he"s young so he"ll become accustomed to having you touch and examine him. By making grooming an enjoyable experience for him, you"ll also make him more willing to accept veterinary exams and other handling by people. Think of grooming not simply as maintenance but as a wonderful bonding experience between the two of you. Brush your English Foxhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Keep nails short so they don"t splinter. If you are uncomfortable trimming your English Foxhound"s nails, take him to a groomer or have it done at your veterinary clinic.
The English Foxhound is great with older children who are a match for his energetic and bouncy nature. He"s not recommended for homes with small children simply because they"re too easily knocked over by the swishing tail or enthusiastic antics of a rambunctious dog. Kind as they are, English Foxhounds, like all breeds, should never be left unsupervised with young children. Being pack dogs, they love the company of other dogs, especially other English Foxhounds, and they"re quite comfortable around horses. They generally do well with other animals, but with their strong prey drive, they may chase smaller pets. Supervise interactions with cats, smaller dogs, or other animals until you"re sure everyone gets along.

Known as "the moderate setter," the graceful English Setter"s love of people and easygoing nature can make him a super friend for an active family as well as a fine hunting dog. He"s not as rollicking as the Irish setter nor as standoffish toward strangers as the Gordon Setter. Gentle, kind, and affectionate, he"s devoted to his family, sociable with strangers, and gets along just fine with kids. While he isn"t precise enough to achieve the highest scores in obedience competition, he is moderately easy to train. The English Setter is a good watchdog and will bark to alert his people that someone is approaching the house. Once he"s introduced to guests, however, he happily accepts their presence. All these qualities make him a good choice for a first-time dog owner who appreciates this breed"s beauty and sweetness and can provide him with the exercise he needs. English Setters are quiet indoors, but outside they love to run and play with other dogs and people. A daily run, off-leash play in a fenced area, or an energetic hike through a nearby park or wilderness area will be just this English breed"s cup of tea. While he"s generally mild mannered and sensitive, the English Setter can be a little willful. Counter that tendency with kind but firm training from early puppyhood, and set boundaries so he knows exactly what you expect. Avoid harsh training techniques. A spoonful of sugar — in the form of praise or a treat when he does what you like — will work much better than an angry voice. His tendency toward independent decision making — he"s been bred for centuries to work at a distance from the hunter — means you must find interesting ways to hold his attention and teach him what you want him to know. Because they"re so athletic, English Setters excel at activities such as agility and rally obedience. They can also make super therapy dogs with their easygoing disposition and love of people. Birders may like him, too. When he sees birds, he stands still and leans forward intently, sets, or points, one paw raised in the air. Of course, hunting comes naturally to most English Setters, and they make an excellent choice for the hobby hunter or for someone who may want to compete in hunt tests or field trials. If you are interested in hunting with your English Setter, look for a breeder who breeds his dogs for their hunting skills and has proven hunting instincts in his lines, which will assure that you have better success. Conformation showing (competing in dog shows) is another activity you can pursue with your English Setter; again, make sure you work with a breeder to obtain a puppy who can succeed in the breed ring. Like many sporting dogs, the English Setter is divided into two types. Those bred for the field have less feathering — long fringes of hair, usually on the legs, belly, and tail — and their coat is not as abundant. They are somewhat smaller than English Setters bred for the show ring. You may hear them called Llewellin or Llewellin-type English Setters after the British gentleman who most influenced their development. They are said to have more instinct for hunting than the show lines of English Setters, known as Laverack or Laverack-type English Setters. Edward Laverack was the first recorded breeder of English Setters. His dogs Ponto and Old Moll, acquired in 1825, were the foundation of the breed. If you want a beautiful, mellow dog with the potential to become your partner in all sorts of activities as well as a beloved family member, the English Setter is one to consider. His lovable disposition and lively spirit will inspire your devotion.
English Setters can become nuisance barkers, so discourage this habit when they are young. English Setters gain weight easily, so measure their food and cut back some if they appear to be getting pudgy. A fenced yard is essential; English Setters can"t be trusted to stay in a yard without fencing. English Setters have great digging and jumping abilities, make sure they have a secure fence. They can be difficult to potty train, so start early and be consistent. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Setters as a type of hunting dog were known in England as long as 400 years ago. They were probably a cross of several types of hunting dogs, including pointers and spaniels. The modern English Setter was developed in the 19th century by Englishman Edward Laverack and Welshman R.L. Purcell Llewellin. Laverack purchased his first two dogs, Ponto and Old Moll, from Rev. A. Harrison in 1825, and they became the foundation of the breed. Laverack concentrated on developing a Setter that was gentle and companionable. He probably added Pointer and Irish Setter to his lines and produced dogs that did well in the show ring but poorly in field trials. Llewellin started with Laverack-type dogs but worked to improve their performance in the field. He crossed them with Gordon Setters and other breeds to improve their scenting ability and speed. Both types of English Setters came to America in the late 1800s. Laverack"s line became the foundation for the show setters of today and Llewellin"s line for the field dogs. Setters today have a unique appearance, with their sculpted heads, athletic bodies, and long feathery tails. The show dogs tend to be a bit larger than the field dogs. They have a more luxurious coat and differ slightly in coat pattern. Patches of color are often seen in field English Setters, but they aren"t desirable for show dogs. Of course, they don"t make a bit of difference if your English Setter is a family companion. The show dogs are capable of hunting, but the field dogs tend to have a keener nose and greater speed. English Setters are rare, ranking 98th among the breeds registered by the American Kennel Club, so if you"d like to share your life with one of these happy, lively dogs, be prepared to spend some time on a waiting list before a puppy is available.
Males stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 65 to 80 pounds; females 23 to 25 inches and 45 to 55 pounds.
The English Setter should be affectionate, kind, and gentle. He"s lively, as befits a sporting dog, but not so active that he"ll exhaust you. An English Setter will bark to let you know someone is approaching the home, but he welcomes people that you introduce to him. Temperament doesn"t happen in a vacuum. It"s affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, English Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. English Setters work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often involves them working well away from the hunter — they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The English Setter who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.
English Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia (HD): This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, low energy levels, drooping of the eyelids, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Deafness: Deafness is fairly common and can provide many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and your puppy. If your dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for the animal. Regardless of your decision, it is best to notify your breeder so he or she can take steps not to repeat that breeding. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful arthritis or lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight also relieves pressure on his joints. How elbow dysplasia will affect your dog is difficult to determine as there are varying degrees of the disease.
The ideal situation for an English Setter is life in a house with access to a fenced yard where he can play. A fence will keep him from wandering off in search of birds or other prey. He"ll appreciate a good half-hour run off leash in a fenced area or a walk or hike on leash. It"s not unusual for English Setters to turn couch potato when they"re about three years old, but they still need exercise to stay in shape. Puppies have different exercise needs. Their skeletal system is still developing and won"t be mature until they"re about two years old. Don"t let them run or jump on hard surfaces, including jumping on and off furniture, and cover wood or tile floors with skid-resistant rugs so they don"t slip and slide into walls or fall and injure themselves. Here"s a good schedule for providing your Setter puppy with exercise. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for him to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. If you provide them with toys, they can keep themselves entertained quite well. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet his needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Gradually increase the distance you walk. After he"s a year old, your Setter pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. English Setter puppies are curious and active. Like any puppy, they will find and chew anything that"s within reach. If nothing else, a puppy will teach you to keep your home picked up! Crate train your English Setter when he"s young, and place him in his crate with a sturdy toy for entertainment when you can"t be there to supervise him. That will keep him out of trouble and your possessions in one piece. They can also be difficult to housetrain, another instance in which a crate can come in handy. To successfully housetrain your English Setter, start early, keep him on a regular schedule, reward him with praise or a treat when he potties outside, keep playtime and potty time separate, and crate him when you can"t supervise him. A puppy in a crate means no accidents in the house and no angry people cleaning up pee or poop. Never keep your puppy in the crate without a potty break for more than two to four hours.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Setter, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The English Setter"s attractive coat is one of his charms. The coat lies flat without any curl or woolliness. It"s embellished with feathering — a longer fringe of hair — on the ears, chest, belly, underside of the thighs, backs of the legs, and on the tail: just enough to be pretty but not so much that it would impede the Setter"s progress in the field. His colors — blue belton, orange or lemon belton, blue belton and tan, and liver belton hearken back to his English hunting heritage. Belton is a village where the breed"s founder, Edward Laverack, liked to hunt. The coat is white with an intermingling of darker hairs all over the body. An English Setter with a blue belton coat, then, is white with black markings; orange or lemon belton, white with orange or lemon; blue belton and tan includes, natch, tan markings, making this dog a tricolor; and liver belton is white with deep reddish-brown markings. Puppies are usually born white, although some may have patches of orange, black, or liver. When he"s properly groomed, an English Setter has a stunning coat. Brush him at least three times a week — daily is better — with a stiff bristle brush to keep the skin healthy and the coat shiny, and use a steel comb to gently remove any tangles or mats. A bath every six weeks or so will keep him smelling nice. Like all dogs, he sheds, but brushing will help keep loose hairs off your clothes and furniture. You may also want to trim stray hairs every six weeks for a neat appearance. If you"re uncomfortable doing that, you can take him to a professional groomer or ask the breeder to show you how. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Setter may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Setter"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Setter to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
It"s often more common to need to protect an adult English Setter from children than the other way around. He"s tolerant and mellow and will put up with a lot — although he shouldn"t have to! Because puppies and toddlers are both in the process of being civilized, they need close supervision to prevent any ear pulling or tail tugging on the part of either party. Many breeders prefer to sell puppies to homes where children are at least six years old and more able to control their actions. They recommend adult English Setters for homes with younger children. Whatever your situation, always teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. English Setters can do well with other dogs and animals, especially if they are raised with them. They are birdy, however, and you should protect pet birds until you"re sure your Setter understands they"re off limits. Some dogs can learn that fact, if they"re taught from puppyhood, but don"t assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your Setter doesn"t pull your parakeet"s tail or your parrot take a bite out of your Setter"s sensitive nose.

The English Springer Spaniel, named for the way he "springs" at game to flush it for the hunter, has long been a favorite with sportsmen, but this lively, beautiful dog also makes a wonderful family companion if he receives the training and exercise he needs. English Springer Spaniels are smart and eager to please, not to mention enthusiastic. They are happy dogs and seem to have a good sense of humor. They usually do well with children if they are brought up with them from puppyhood and are affectionate toward their families. They also are generally good with other pets in the household, even small ones, but might see pet birds as prey since those are what they"re bred to hunt. Because they"re hunting dogs, English Springer Spaniels require a lot of exercise, but keep them on leash in unfenced areas or they may decide to go hunting on their own. Because they are such good athletes, many non-hunting owners participate in activities such as obedience, agility, flyball, and tracking with their English Springer Spaniels. They also make great therapy dogs, bringing smiles to people in hospitals and nursing homes. English Springer Spaniels will bark if strangers come to your house, but if you"re looking for a guard dog, keep looking. They are loving, gentle dogs who expect even strangers to give them attention. Because of their affectionate nature, they aren"t a one-person dog. They are very people-oriented, and shouldn"t be left home alone or isolated from people for long periods. English Springers are medium-size dogs with the typical gentle spaniel expression and drop ears. Their compact body is protected by a dense, medium-length coat adorned with feathering, a longer fringe of hair, on the ears, chest, legs, and belly. The wag of the docked tail can only be described as merry. Their bodies are a little longer than they are tall. That"s because a dog can tire easily when his body is too long — highly undesirable for a hardworking sporting dog! Those are the basics, but if you were to put two English Springer Spaniels next to each other, they might look very different. That"s because in many sporting (hunting) breeds, some dogs are bred to work in the field, while others are bred primarily to be show dogs. Eventually, they become two very different types, and that"s what has happened with English Springer Spaniels. Why are we telling you this? Read on and we"ll explain. The gene pools of field and show dogs have been almost completely segregated for about 70 years. Field Springer Spaniels are athletes and they look the part. They usually have shorter coats, their noses are pointier, and their ears are not as long. Field Springers are bred for hunting ability, sense of smell, and trainability. Show Spring Spaniels have longer hair, a squarer muzzle, and longer ears. They"re prized for their good looks and showmanship. (A prime example of this type is James — more formally known as Ch. Felicity"s Diamond Jim — who won Best in Show at Westminster in 2007.) Show dogs can hunt, but they"re too slow and methodical to do well in field trials, which is where field-bred Springers shine. The differences affect you when you"re choosing a puppy. Both types need lots of exercise, but if you want a companion, a field-bred Springer may have more energy than you need or want. Look for a puppy from show lines. If you want a Springer who will be competitive in field trials, just the opposite is true. It"s essential, then, to have a clear idea of what you want from a Springer when you talk to breeders. They can help you choose the puppy that"s right for you or direct you to a breeder whose dogs will better fit your needs. In fact, that"s the test of a really great breeder--she wants to help you find the dog that"s right for you, even if that means losing a sale.
English Springer Spaniels don"t like to be left alone and may become nuisance barkers if they"re bored or lonely. In recent years, there have been reports of English Springer Spaniels who are aggressive or overly submissive. Be sure to get your Springer from a breeder who tests his or her breeding dogs for health and temperament. In essence, there are two varieties of English Spring Spaniel: ones intended to work in the field, and ones intended to show. Be sure you know the difference and get the type that best suits your needs. Don"t expect your English Springer Spaniel to be a good guard dog. They bark at noises and when strangers come around, but quickly settle down and want to be pet. English Springer Spaniels were developed to have great stamina and energy. Be sure that you can provide your dog with adequate exercise or he may become nervous and destructive. Some English Springer Spaniels can demonstrate submissive urination, which means they pee in excitement or anxiety when you come home. The best way to deal with this is to make homecomings very low key by not looking at or paying attention to your dog until you"ve been home for a few minutes. If you do this, your puppy may grow out of this behavior. Be sure to keep your English Springer Spaniel on a leash when you take him to unprotected areas. You never know when he will see a bird and be overcome by his instinct to go after it! To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Spaniel-type dogs are thought to have originated in Spain — hence their name — many centuries ago and were probably taken to other parts of the world by the Romans or via trading ships. Spaniels were mentioned in Welsh law as early as 300 A.D. That"s more than 1,700 years ago! Spaniels that look similar to today"s English Springer Spaniel are depicted in 16th and 17th century artwork. Before guns were invented, the spaniel was used to flush gamebirds or small animals by springing at them and driving them into the open so they could be captured by hunting hawks, coursing hounds, or nets flung over them. When firearms were invented in the 17th century, spaniels proved to be especially adept at flushing game for shooters. During the 19th and early 20th centuries in England, dogs of the same litter were classified by their hunting use rather than their breed. Smaller dogs in the litter would be used to hunt woodcock, and therefore were called Cockers. Larger pups in the same litter would be used to flush game and were called Springers. In 1902, England"s Kennel Club granted a special place in their Stud Book for the English Springer Spaniel, and a separate classification at their show in 1903. At that show, Mr. William Arkwright judged the breed. He awarded the dog Challenge Certificate to Mr. Winton Smith"s Beechgrove Will and best of opposite sex went to Mr. Harry Jones" bitch Fansome. By 1906, Beechgrove Will became the breed"s first Champion. In 1913, an English Springer Spaniel was imported by a Canadian breeder. A little more than 10 years later, the breed had become one of the most popular breeds registered by the American Kennel Club. The English Springer Spaniel Field Trial Association, the parent club of the breed in the U.S., was formed in 1924. At that time, English Springer Spaniels that competed in field trials on one day might be shown in conformation dog shows the next day. That changed in the early 1940s when field trial enthusiasts began breeding dogs with qualities that would produce top results in the field, and show enthusiasts began to breed dogs that were both consistent with the breed"s standard, and had the "flash" to win in the show ring. Field-bred dogs are bred for a keen sense of smell, speed, style, working ability and endurance above all, and today the two types are not interbred. Both types have the instinct to work and can be trained to the gun, but very few English Springer Spaniels work in both field and show events. The last dual champion (meaning that it was a champion in both field and conformation events) was a dog named Green Valley Punch in 1938. Whether he"s a field or show dog, however, today"s English Springer is a popular breed, ranking 26th among the breeds registered by the American Kennel Club.
English Springer Spaniels weigh between 45 and 55 pounds and stand 18 to 22 inches tall at the shoulder. Field-bred Springers are generally a bit lighter than those bred for the show ring.
The typical Springer is friendly, eager to please, quick to learn, and willing to obey. He should never be aggressive or timid. In recent years there have been reports of aggression or excessive timidity in the breed, as well as excessive separation anxiety. These traits aren"t desirable and could be an indication of poor breeding. As with any breed of dog, it"s important to research breeders and find ones who test their breeding stock not only for genetic diseases but also temperament. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Springers need early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they are not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Springer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Springers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Springers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Springers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Most cases are mild and there is no detectable loss in vision. Veterinary ophthalmologists can do tests to determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Retinal dysplasia shouldn"t affect a dog"s ability to function as a companion, but affected Springers shouldn"t be bred. Entropion: This is a condition caused by the lower eyelid folding inward toward the eye, resulting in chronic irritation of the surface of the eye. It can be corrected with surgery. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degeneration of the layers of the retina. The disease is progressive and eventually results in blindness. In Springers it"s usually seen between 2 and 6 years of age. The disorder is still considered rare, but its incidence has increased. There is no treatment, but the condition doesn"t cause pain or discomfort. Dogs who lose their sight can get along very well using their other senses. Just don"t move the furniture around. Skin Disorders: Typical signs of skin disease include scaliness, greasiness, itching, pyoderma (infection), and occasional hair loss. There are genetic as well as other factors, such as allergies, involved in the development of skin diseases. Be sure to check with your vet if you notice any of the conditions listed above. Ear Infections: Because of their pendant ear flaps, ear infections are common in English Springer Spaniels. You may be able to prevent most ear infections by keeping the ears clean and dry. As your veterinarian for ear care products and if an infection occurs anyway, have your dog treated by your veterinarian. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) Deficiency: PFK is an enzyme that is needed for the body to use sugar for energy. Some Springers have an inherited deficiency of this enzyme. Signs may be so mild that they go unrecognized for years, but some dogs have severe illness, including hyperventilation, muscle wasting, and fever. Your vet can test for the deficiency measuring the PFK enzyme through a blood sample.
English Springer Spaniels are loving, devoted dogs who can live comfortably in most homes as long as they get plenty of daily exercise. The amount of exercise your adult Springer needs depends; Field Springers need more than Show Springers. If you have a fenced yard or acreage where he can play, your Springer will enjoy being outdoors with you while you garden or read or grill dinner. He"ll run around on his own, then check in with you every few minutes, just as he might do in the field with a hunter. One or two daily mile-long walks will also help him work off all that Springer energy. Springers also like to swim, and if you have a pool or access to a lake, it"s a great way for them to get exercise. Puppies have different exercise needs. * 9 weeks to 4 months of age: Puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. * 4 to 6 months of age: Weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. * 6 months to a year of age: Play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, and not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. * one year plus: Your Springer pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies may eat as much as 4 cups a day. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Springer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
English Springer Spaniels have a double coat, which means that they have an insulating undercoat that"s covered with a topcoat, in much the same way that you might layer a sweater and a coat for warmth. Their medium-length topcoat is flat or wavy, and the undercoat is short, soft, and dense. Together, they"re waterproof, weatherproof, and thornproof. They have a fringe of feathering on the ears, chest, legs and belly. A healthy Springer coat is clean and shiny. English Springer Spaniels come in several color combinations. Perhaps best known are the Springers with black or liver (deep reddish-brown) with white markings or primarily white with black or liver markings. Some are blue or liver roan. Blue is a dilution of the black coat, and roan describes a fine mixture of colored hairs with white hairs. Tri-color Springers are black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually on the eyebrows, cheeks, inside of the ears, and beneath the tail. Sometimes the white parts of the coat are flecked with ticking, small, isolated areas of black hairs. Springers bred for the show ring usually have more color than white, whereas field Springers tend to have more white so hunters can see them easily in the field. Brush your Springer at least three times a week to keep him looking his best and to avoid mats, or tangles. Springers shed moderately all year long, and regular brushing will also help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. You may also want to trim around the head, neck, ears, tail, and feet, just to give your Springer a neater appearance. Many English Springer Spaniel owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every two to three months for trimming. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Springer may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Springer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Springer enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.
Springers usually do well with children if they are brought up with them from puppyhood. Older Springers who are unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with them appropriately. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Springers are also generally good with other pets in the household, even small ones, but they might see pet birds as prey since those are what they are bred to hunt. Keep them separated so they don"t hurt each other. A parrot"s beak is a mighty weapon.

When you think of the English Toy Spaniel, or King Charles Spaniel as he is known in Britain, the words sweet, gentle, and lovable typically come to mind. He has been loved by kings and held in high regard by many. Charlies are compact, square-bodied dogs with a short face, domed head, large dark eyes, long fringed ears, and a flowing silky coat. Their docked tail is two to four inches long and is adorned with silky feathering. He wears a straight or slightly wavy coat with feathering on the legs and feet. The English Toy Spaniel is a quiet, unassuming breed that was developed as a companion dog. He requires little exercise and has a laidback personality. The ET"s idea of a great day is to spend it sitting near his favorite person, quietly showering her with love. Charlies make excellent companions for seniors or anyone who doesn"t have the strength or mobility to handle other dogs. That devotion to people can be a negative trait, however, because he can suffer from separation anxiety. English Toy Spaniels do well in apartments and can adapt to any lifestyle except being left alone for long periods of time or left to live outside or in kennels. They generally get along well with other dogs but can be shy and timid in the presence of strangers. English Toy Spaniels are very gentle with children but are not recommended for homes with young children since the accompanying noise and excitement may overwhelm them. For fun, he likes to chase birds and butterflies. Keep him on leash outdoors so he doesn"t chase them right in front of a car. Training can be easy with this breed as long as you understand his nature. He"s independent and will occasionally disregard commands when they are first given. Generally, however, he"s happy to please and enjoys the companionship training provides. English Toy Spaniels may bark to alert you to someone"s approach and they might bite someone who scares them or whom they don"t like, but that"s about the extent of their watchdog ability. An English Toy Spaniel should be monitored in hot weather because his short muzzle makes him susceptible to heat exhaustion. He should live in a home with adequate ventilation and air conditioning, and his time outdoors should be limited during hot and humid weather. If you are looking for a dignified dog who is calm, affectionate, and gentle, one who will enjoy spending all his time with you, one who is happy and devoted, then the English Toy Spaniel is the perfect breed for you.
Socialization is important with this breed because they can be timid when they are exposed to new people or situations. Considered to be an average shedder, the English Toy Spaniel should be brushed every week to remove loose hair and to keep the coat from tangling. For the dog"s own safety, the English Toy Spaniel should be kept on leash whenever they are walked and they should also have a fully fenced yard. English Toy Spaniels do well in apartments. English Toy Spaniels do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they do not overexert themselves. It is recommended that the dogs reside in an air-conditioned dwelling. English Toy Spaniels have low energy levels and low exercise requirements. They are happy spending their days sitting on your knee, and a leisurely walk around the neighborhood will meet their exercise needs. They make excellent companions for older owners. English Toy Spaniels are loving dogs that usually do well with children, but they are not the ideal breed for a home with busy children since they can become overwhelmed by the noise and excitement children make. English Toy Spaniels are companion dogs and thrive when they are with the people they love. They should not live outside or in a kennel away from their family. Separation anxiety is a common problem in the English Toy Spaniel and they can become destructive when they are separated from their owners for a period of time. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
Toy spaniels have existed for centuries and were favorites in royal courts. Mary, Queen of Scots, her grandson Charles I, and great-grandson Charles II were all avid fans of the small spaniels. In fact, their nickname, Charlie, comes from the two kings of that name. They are devoted unto death. Both Mary, Queen of Scots and Charles I were accompanied to their executions by their little spaniels. The toy spaniels of centuries past were slightly different from what we know today. They had a pointed muzzle, but crosses to such breeds as the Japanese Chin and Pug in the 18th and 19th centuries eventually resulted in dogs with the short muzzle and round apple head that are found in the breed today. By the end of the 19th century, the old-style toy spaniel with the more pointed muzzle had passed into history, but an American art lover named Roswell Eldridge offered a large monetary prize to the breeder who could reproduce them. King Charles Spaniel breeders took some of their long-nosed throwbacks and created what is now known as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a slightly larger cousin of the ET. You can see the differences between them if you look carefully. Charlies have a more pushed-in face, a domed head, and ears that are set below the top of the head. Cavaliers have a longer nose, a flat head, and ears that hang from higher on the head. Charlies have a docked tail, while Cavaliers have a long plumelike tail. They come in the same four colors, although the ET"s colors have the more the romantic designations of Prince Charles for the tricolor and King Charles for the black and tan. The Cavalier was given that name to differentiate him from the King Charles Spaniel, but American breeders went a step further and began calling the Charlies English Toy Spaniels. They"re still known as King Charles Spaniels in their homeland of Britain.
The English Toy Spaniel is approximately 10 to 11 inches tall and weighs 8 to 14 pounds.
The sweet and lovable English Toy Spaniel is a true companion dog. He has an aristocratic bearing, but he"s not a snob at all; picture instead a happy, devoted, quiet dog. He enjoys spending time with the people he loves and will fit himself into their lives. The ET requires little exercise and is happiest perched on his owner"s knee. He does well with other dogs and cats if socialized to them and is gentle and loving to children although he"s not best suited to living with them. He can become overwhelmed by excitement and can be shy and timid when he meets new people or is exposed to new situations.
Not all English Toy Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA): Patent Ductus Arteriosis, or PDA, is a common congenital heart disease that is found in many different breeds. It occurs when the ductus arteriosis, a large vessel or shunt that causes an unborn puppy"s blood to pass through the heart and bypass the lungs, fails to close after birth. When that happens, fluid accumulates in the lungs, resulting in labored breathing, fainting, dizzy spells, coughing, heart murmurs, collapse, and heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosis is repaired with surgery. Mitral Valve Insufficiency: Mitral Valve Insufficiency, also known as mitral valve disease or chronic valve disease, is most commonly seen in older dogs and occurs when the mitral valve, which is found between the left atrium and ventricle, begins to fail. When this happens, the mitral valve fails to prevent the flow of blood back into the left atrium. This can cause many devastating side effects, including heart failure. Signs of this disease are a heart murmur, fluid in the lungs, an enlarged heart, lack of energy, and a decrease of strength to the heart muscle. It can be treated for a time with medication, diet, and a restriction of exercise. It helps to keep your Charlie at a healthy weight and his teeth clean and healthy. Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is when one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If the testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not medically treated. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision will be made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner. Seborrhea: Seborrhea is a skin disorder that is categorized as two types: seborrhea oleosa (oily skin) and seborrhea sicca (dry skin). The signs of both are dry, flaky skin, a terrible "doggy smell," and itching, and it is usually accompanied by other ear and skin infections. The causes of seborrhea can be metabolic disorders, allergies, internal and external parasites, and autoimmune diseases. Before treatment can begin, the underlying cause must be determined. Once it is, seborrhea can be treated quite easily with a change in diet, high quality shampoos and conditioners, and occasionally with medication. Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is most commonly a congenital hereditary disease, meaning the dog is born with it and it was passed to him by his parents, but it can also result from trauma or prenatal herpesvirus or parvovirus infections. It can be mild or severe and is caused by an abnormal development of the retina, resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. Retinal dysplasia can be detected as early as six to eight weeks of age. There is no known treatment for retinal dysplasia, but many blind dogs live full lives, and their other senses compensate for the vision impairment. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease affects the hip joint and results in a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone until the bone eventually dies off and collapses and becomes deformed. The result of this deformation is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It is unclear what causes Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Dogs with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease may chew at the hip, move stiffly or painfully, develop progressive lameness, or seem irritable. Treatment is usually strict crate rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Prognosis is generally very good after the surgery and many dogs suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes. Hydrocephalus: When the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain accumulates either because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of perinatal trauma, it places pressure on the brain. This usually occurs in young dogs under the age of 18 months and older dogs that are over 6 years of age. If hydrocephalus is left untreated the dog will die. The obstruction can be removed surgically or through insertion of a shunt. Umbilical Hernia: Umbilical hernia is a condition that is present at birth in which abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left without treatment. Some small hernias close spontaneously by the time the puppy is 6 months old, and some dogs have lived with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done when the dog is being spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition where an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening "strangulation" of the intestine. Open Fontanel: English Toy Spaniels are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby"s will, but sometimes one will not close fully. Of course, a dog should never be struck, but it"s important to understand that even an accidental blow to that spot on the head could kill an English Toy Spaniel with an open fontanel. Fused Toes: Fused toes are a common trait in the English Toy Spaniel and should not be confused with any form of disease or disorders. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In English Toy Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The English Toy Spaniel does not require extensive amounts of daily exercise. They generally exercise themselves at home and require only small walks around the neighborhood or a small game in the back yard. They are not ideal walking companions because they can suffer from joint problems, and long walks can aggravate any problems they may have. Training can be easy with this breed as long as you understand his nature. He is independent and may disregard commands when they are first given. Generally, they are happy to please and enjoy the companionship training provides. Leash training can be particularly difficult since they prefer being off leash, but it is important to keep your English Toy Spaniel on lead whenever he"s not in a fenced area since he can be easily injured by other dogs. Housetraining an English Toy Spaniel can be an easy task as well, and many have been successfully trained to potty on paper when nightly walks or a yard are not available. Socialization is important with this breed since they can be very timid when they are exposed to new people or situations. Occasionally an English Toy Spaniel will stop eating and usually it will be his teeth that are bothering him. Keeping the teeth clean with regular brushing and veterinary cleanings will help prevent any problems. English Toy Spaniels do very well in apartments because of their low energy levels. They are companion dogs and should never be left outside or in a kennel. An English Toy Spaniel should be monitored in hot weather since their short muzzles makes them susceptible to heat exhaustion. It is recommended that they live in homes that have adequate ventilation and air conditioning and their outdoor time should be limited when it is hot and humid.
Recommended daily amount: 0.5 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your English Toy Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog .
The English Toy Spaniel has an abundant coat that is long and straight to slightly wavy with a silky texture. Feathering should appear on all four legs and feet. Fringing should appear on the body, chest and ears. The coat comes in four color patterns: Ruby, a rich mahogany red, with or without a small white patch on the chest; Blenheim, a white base coat with large chestnut or red markings; Prince Charles, a tri-color consisting of a white basecoat with large black patches and tan markings over the eyes, under the tail and on the underside of the ears; and King Charles, a rich black with mahogany tan markings. The English Toy Spaniel requires little in the way of grooming. Give him a bath once or twice a month, using a high-quality shampoo to keep his coat silky. Comb him once a week to remove any dead hair or tangles, and wash his face daily to remove any "sleepies" from the eyes or food left on his face after a meal. English Toy Spaniels are considered to be average shedders. Clean ears regularly with a damp warm cloth and run a cotton swab around the edge of the canal. Never stick the cotton swab into the actual ear canal. You should also check ears, eyes and teeth for any discharge or bad smells. Both are signs that your Charlie may need to see the veterinarian.
English Toy Spaniels can be loving toward children, but they can become overwhelmed by the noise and stimulation young children create. This can lead to biting if they are handled roughly. English Toy Spaniels do very well with other pets, especially if they are raised with them.
English Toy Spaniels are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an English Toy Spaniel, a rescue group is a good place to start. English Toy Spaniel Club of America Rescue English Toy Spaniel Rescue Official Web Site

The Entlebucher, or Entle for short, is a Swiss herding breed related to the Appenzeller, the Bernese Mountain Dog, and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; of the four, he"s the smallest. He"s known for his intelligence, personable attitutude, agility, and loyalty. He"s independent and self-confident, yet he bonds strongly to his person and is happiest spending the day at his family"s side. He"s got energy to burn, and needs an owner who can give him about an hour of vigorous exercise a day — if not herding flocks, then competing in dog sports like tracking, frisbee, or agility. Like other smart working dogs, he loves having jobs to do, so begin training this smart cookie early, teaching him to gather up dirty laundry, bring in the newspaper, fetch your slippers, or other useful tasks. The Entlebucher can be territorial and will bark to announce the presence of strangers or arrival of guests. He"s aloof with people he doesn"t know, and like any dog, he needs early socialization to learn how to behave around strangers and other dogs. He loves his kids but, because he also loves roughousing, he must learn to be gentle with little ones. He may try to "herd" his kids by nipping at their heels.

If you and your active family are looking for a medium-sized dog with energy to spare, consider the Field Spaniel. He is larger than the English Cocker Spaniel and smaller than the English Springer Spaniel. He"s a wonderful companion for family that can meet his needs for exercise, training, and companionship, and he will give you years of competition in such dog sports as obedience, agility, rally, tracking, hunt tests and conformation. Hunters will appreciate their ability to quarter in dense cover — that means he hunts by running a zigzag pattern through heavy brush — and flush birds such as pheasants, quail, and chukars. Field Spaniels love people, and they are eager to please, loyal, and loving. At playtime, their water-loving nature comes out. They will sometimes use their water dish as the local swimming hole, making quite a mess around the house. While they can sometimes be reserved with strangers, they should never be fearful, shy, or aggressive. Some Field Spaniels bond with just one family member, but most accept everyone in the family as their best friends. They are excellent with children but aren"t fond of rough, loud play, preferring to walk away and find a quieter activity. Field Spaniels are alert and will bark a warning when visitors approach, but they are not guard dogs. Training, whether it"s for dog sports or nice household manners, helps prevent your Field Spaniel from becoming bored and getting into mischief. It"s important to work around the independent streak that allows this breed to perform so well in the field. If you use motivational methods and frequent rewards, you will end up with a happy dog who is a joy to work with. Field Spaniels are extremely sensitive dogs and do not respond well to loud tones of voice or harsh handling. Field Spaniels require less grooming than most other spaniel breeds. Even to get them ready for the conformation show ring is not an involved process as they are to be shown looking as natural as possible. No fancy trimming necessary! The Field Spaniel is a rare breed that can be hard to find. Take the time to research breeders and find one who is willing to help you find just the right puppy. A responsible breeder will ensure that your puppy"s parents are screened for any genetic conditions that may exist in the breed and will be diligent in removing from the gene pool any dogs with serious health conditions for which no screening test is yet available.
Field Spaniels need regular contact with people; they become neurotic if locked away in a kennel or out in a yard with no human companionship. Socialize them well when young to avoid timidity and problems with other dogs. They are active dogs and require regular exercise. They will follow their nose so a securely fenced yard is a must. Field Spaniels love water and will play in any water they find, including their water bowl in the house. They will share the fun by bringing the water to you also. They love to eat and will steal food when possible. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Field Spaniel was developed in England in the latter half of the 19th century to be a medium-sized, all-black dog, which was unusual at the time as most hunters preferred dogs with some white so they could be easily seen in the field. The Field Spaniel was created at the same time that dog shows were becoming popular and is considered the first spaniel developed for conformation showing while at the same time retaining his excellent skills in the field. Until 1901, spaniels were divided by weight, so if one puppy in a litter grew to be more than 25 pounds, he was called a Field Spaniel. If he weighed less than 25 pounds, he was classified as a Cocker Spaniel. The breed started out as a popular dog, but through some not-so-successful cross-breeding, fanciers turned him into a dog that was longer than he was tall, with short legs, a large head, and too much coat. That didn"t make for a very good or very attractive hunting dog, and the public expressed its displeasure. The Field Spaniel"s popularity bottomed out. Fortunately, a man named Mortimer Smith made the effort to bring back the Field Spaniel"s functional good looks. The AKC registered its first Field Spaniel, Colehill Rufus, in 1894, but when a fire destroyed a major kennel in 1909, the breed practically disappeared in the United States. The last registration of a Field Spaniel occurred in 1930. The next importation of Field Spaniels occurred in 1967, and those three dogs along with subsequent imports are the basis of the breed today. Despite his fine qualities, he remains a rare breed compared to other spaniels.
Give or take an inch, males stand 18 inches at the shoulder, females 17 inches. The average Field Spaniel weighs 37 to 45 pounds.
Field Spaniels are easygoing, sensitive, fun-loving, independent, and smart. They enjoy being with people, although they may be reserved when they first meet strangers. No Field Spaniel should ever be shy, fearful, or aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Field Spaniel needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Field Spaniel puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Field Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Field Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Field Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Ear Infections: Field Spaniels can be prone to ear infections because of their floppy ears. The ears trap moisture and should be regularly checked. Hip Dysplasia: A degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds. Although it is a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can be found in a puppy with parents free of the disease. When it is found in such a puppy, it is usually linked to environmental factors such as poor nutrition or too much weight gain during puppyhood. Allergies: Allergies are common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The treatment for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is a life- threatening disease that causes the body to attack its own red blood cells. Signs of AIHA are jaundice; fainting; pale gums, lips and eye margins; dark tea- colored urine; lethargy; and a rapid heartbeat. When tested the blood will have a low red blood cell count. If AIHA is left untreated, it will generally result in death. Treatment can take months to years and usually involves the administration of the steroid prednisone and in some cases blood transfusions. Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract. Ectropion: Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infection such as conjunctivitis. If ectropion is severe the eye should be repaired surgically, but in mild cases no treatment is necessary. Epilepsy: The Field Spaniel can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be treated by medications but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires lifetime treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.
Moderately active indoors, Field Spaniels aren"t recommended for apartment or condo living. They do best with a large yard to run in. With their strong hunting instincts, it"s best that they have a securely fenced yard so they don"t wander off into trouble. Locking this breed away in a kennel or chaining him in the yard with minimal human contact will make him neurotic. He does best when given a great deal of exercise with chances to run and explore. Just be aware that he has a tendency to follow his nose. He will also enjoy long walks on leash.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Field Spaniel in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Field Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Field Spaniel has a dense, water-repellent single coat, meaning there"s no undercoat. His hair is moderately long and can be flat or slightly wavy. The chest, underbody, backs of the legs, and rear end are adorned with moderate feathering but not the masses of fur you might see on a Cocker Spaniel. The coat comes in black, liver, golden liver, roan, or any of those colors with tan points. Some Field Spaniels have a small amount of white on the chest or throat. Joy of joys, the Field Spaniel requires much less grooming than other spaniel breeds. The coat should be brushed regularly and bathed as needed. Brush your Field Spaniel"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Field Spaniel to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Field Spaniels are fond of children, but noisy roughhousing isn"t their style. As with any breed, always supervise the interaction between Field Spaniels and young children to prevent any ear-tugging and tail pulling on the part of either party.

No, his name doesn"t mean lapdog. This smart, hard-working dog originated in Lapland, in Finland"s far north, where he was used to herd reindeer for the semi-nomadic Sami people. These days, he still has a strong herding instinct that can be put to use with more common varieties of livestock. He can also enjoy other dog jobs such as agility, obedience, and therapy work. Friendly toward people and gentle with children, he"s a good companion for people who don"t mind a dog with a long, profuse coat.

The Finnish Spitz has the distinction of being the national dog of Finland, where this ancient hunting breed is still used to hunt a wide variety of game. In Finland, he"s known as the Suomenpystykorva (pronounced SWOH-men-pi-stih-KOR-vuh), which means Finnish Pricked Ear Dog, and he can"t compete there for a show title until he has proved himself in hunting trials. He"s also been called the Finnish Barking Bird Dog because of his unique hunting habits, and in England, he"s known as Finsk spets. In 1891, the name was officially changed to Finnish Spitz, and the nickname Finkie became popular after the dog"s arrival in England in the 1920s. Finnish Spitz dogs have a square build and a fox-like look. They are "bark pointers," meaning they indicate where the game is by barking to attract the hunter"s attention. They"ve mostly been used to hunt small game, such as squirrels and grouse, but they"ve also hunted moose, elk, and even bear. These are rather small hunting dogs, being about 17 1/2 to 20 inches tall at the shoulder. Their necks are shorter than some of the other Spitz breeds because Finnish Spitz look up to point their game. The head is wedge-shaped and resembles that of a fox. Finnish Spitz have a lively, light gait, and are as intelligent as they are animated. They make good companions for active families. Friendly, they get along well with children. They"re good watchdogs and protect their families, but they rarely show aggression unless it"s warranted. In America, Finnish Spitz are primarily companion dogs. In their native Finland, however, they"re still used for hunting, mostly for a large game bird called a capercaille and for black grouse. The way Finnish Spitz hunt is unique. He runs ahead of the hunter until he finds a bird. Then he follows the bird until it settles in a tree, and attracts the bird"s attention by running back and forth under the tree, wagging his tail. It"s thought that the bird is lulled into a sense of security by the dog"s movements, at which point the Finnish Spitz begins to bark, softly at first and gradually getting louder. The bird generally doesn"t notice the hunter approaching because of the noise and action of the dog. If the bird flies off before the hunter reaches it, the Finnish Spitz stops barking and follows it until it lands, then starts barking again. This is the reason these dogs are called "Bark Pointers." Elkhound and similar Spitz breeds hunt in a similar fashion. In Scandinavia, barking competitions are held for the King of the Barkers. Finnish Spitz have been recorded as barking 160 times per minute in competitions. By now, you"ve probably guessed that barking is an important part of the Finnish Spitz makeup. They like to bark. If yours is primarily a companion and you have close neighbors, you"ll need to train your dog to stop barking on command, or hope that your neighbors are very tolerant. Training these independent, strong-willed dogs can be a challenge. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. Their intelligence makes them become easily bored with repetitive training, so keep your training sessions short. Professional trainers say that Finnish Spitz can be manipulative and too smart for their owners, so you need to be persistent and firm. If you stick with it, however, you"ll be greatly rewarded by your dog"s intelligence and aptitude for sports such as obedience, agility, and rally. Also, keep in mind that Finnish Spitz are slow to mature. It generally takes about four years for them to become mentally mature. In the years building up to that, your Finnish Spitz will need time to decide whether or not he"s going to accept you as the leader of the pack. At times, he"ll be silly and rebellious; other times he"ll be self-contained and contemplative. A Finnish Spitz doesn"t tolerate being bullied, but with consistency, fairness, and patience, you"ll gain his respect and obedience. Finnish Spitz want to be members of the family and are naturally protective. They are sensitive dogs and don"t do well in homes where there"s a lot of tension. But give them a loving atmosphere and include them in everything you do and they"ll become a loyal, lively, and fun-loving friend.
Finnish Spitz are lively, high-energy dogs and require lots of daily exercise. These dogs are called Bark Pointers for a good reason. They love to bark! Train them at an early age to stop barking on command, or hope that you have tolerant neighbors! Because Finnish Spitz are hunting dogs, they should never be turned out in unsecured areas. A fenced yard is a necessity. If left outside alone for too long, Finnish Spitz will bark at everything they see unless trained at an early age not to do so. Finnish Spitz take a long time to mature mentally, and can be rather silly and puppyish until they are three to four years old. Hunting dogs in general can be independent thinkers, which makes them appear to be stubborn at times. Finnish Spitz are no different. Learn the proper training methods and motivations, however, and you"ll be pleased with your dog"s intelligence and willingness to learn. Finnish Spitz generally are good with other pets in the household, but can be aggressive with dogs they don"t know. This is a breed that tends to be aloof and suspicious of strangers. They aren"t good guard dogs, but they will alert you by barking if someone approaches your home. Finnish Spitz love to eat, especially treats. Since they can be somewhat manipulative, they will try to get as many treats from you as possible and can become overweight. Try giving them a carrot or a low-fat treat instead. Never buy a Finnish Spitz from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The origin of the Finnish Spitz is undocumented, but dogs of the same type have been used for game hunting of all kinds in Finland for hundreds of years. It"s believed that Spitz-type dogs were brought from central Russia by tribes of Finno-Ugrian people who migrated into Finland a couple of thousand years ago. They used the dogs primarily as all-purpose hunting dogs. Because they were so isolated, the Finnish Spitz breed developed with little influence from other breeds. That changed when transportation and roadways improved. People started coming to the lands where the Finnish Spitz lived, bringing their own dogs and mating them with the Finnish Spitz. So much cross-breeding occurred that by 1880, the Finnish Spitz was close to extinction. Then something wonderful happened. Two men from Helsinki, named Hugo Sandberg and Hugo Roos, were on a hunting trip in the northern forests and saw some Finnish Spitz hunting. They realized the significance of these dogs and made it their mission to save the breed. Hugo Sandberg wrote an article for an 1890 edition of the Sporten magazine about the dogs he"d seen. His description was so complete and carefully worded that in 1892, when the Finnish Kennel Club recognized the breed, the first Breed Standard was based his article. Sandberg judged at the first Helsinki dog show in1891. The breed was given the name Finnish Spitz in 1897. Hugo Roos played his part in preserving the breed by actively breeding Finnish Spitz for 30 years. He showed and judged longer than that. He is credited with gathering the foundation dogs and pioneering the breed until the 1920s. In 1920, England"s Sir Edward Chichester was so enchanted by the breed while on a hunting trip to Finland, he brought a brace of them back to England with him. Later, he imported an unrelated stud dog. A few years later, Lady Kitty Ritson, of Tulchan Kennels, also saw the breed in Finland and fell in love with it. Along with several other fanciers, she organized the Finnish Spitz Club in England, which was first registered with the England"s Kennel Club in 1934. She also imported many dogs and was the first to give them the affectionate nickname Finkie. World War II was a difficult time for the breed, as it was for many others. After the war, the quality of the dogs being shown was very poor. Two dogs imported to England from Finland, Mountjay Peter, and Kiho Seivi, and one imported from Sweden, Friedstahills Saila, improved the breed dramatically in England. In 1959, two pups were born while in quarantine in England. They were named Tophunter Tommi and Tophunter Turre. These two dogs appeared in almost every pedigree of England"s top winning Finnish Spitz until the early 1970s. In recent years, a bitch named Irheilu Penan Pipsa of Toveri has had the greatest influence on the breed in England. She appears in the pedigree of nearly every top-winning Finnish Spitz in England and is the all-time top brood bitch in the breed there. Finnish Spitz were first imported to the U.S. from England in 1959 by Cullabine Rudolph. In the 1960s, Henry Davidson of Minnesota and Alex Hassel of Connecticut began breeding imported Finnish Spitz. The Finnish Spitz Club of America was formed in 1975 and the American Breed Standard, based on the Finnish Standard, for the breed was developed in 1976. AKC allowed Finnish Spitz to be shown in the Miscellaneous Class in April 1984. In 1988, the breed was approved to be shown in the Non-Sporting Group. In 1993, the Finnish Spitz Club of America became a member of the American Kennel Club. Today, the breed is well-established in Finland and Sweden, but it remains relatively uncommon in the U.S., ranking 147th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC. Nearly 2,000 Finnish Spitz are registered annually with the Finnish Kennel Club compared with a total of 637 between 1890 and 1930. The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979, and is even mentioned in Finnish patriotic songs.
Males are 17 1/2 to 20 inches tall and weigh 27 to 35 pounds. Females are 15 1/2 to 18 inches tall and weigh 22 to 30 pounds.
This Nordic breed is active and friendly. His alert nature makes him an excellent watchdog, and he"s protective of family members. He may be cautious toward strangers but should never be shy or aggressive. He loves children and gets along with other animals, especially when he"s been raised with them. On the down side, he"s an independent thinker and can be a challenge to train. He may not be mentally and emotionally mature until he"s three or four years old. Like every dog, Finnish Spitz need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Finnish Spitz puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Finnish Spitz are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Finnish Spitz will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Canine Hip Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation occurs when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. In severe cases, however, surgical repair may be necessary. Epilepsy. This seizure disorder can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with proper management of this disease, which can be hereditary or of unknown cause. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Finnish Spitz, you should expect to see the results of annual blood and urine tests for kidney function and abnormalities associated with protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, renal dysplasia, and Addison"s disease and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Finnish Spitz have a lot of energy and high exercise needs. They aren"t recommended for apartment dwellers or families who don"t have the time and energy to give them a lot of exercise. If left alone in the backyard, a Finnish Spitz will probably engage in his favorite activity — barking! His next favorite activity will be hunting for prey, which can include digging for mice and other burrowing animals or chasing squirrels and birds. This is a breed that requires a knowledgeable, active owner and understanding neighbors. He prefers cooler climates and does well as an inside dog. When you take him for a walk in public places, such as parks, be sure to keep him on leash so he won"t take off chasing something. Give your Finnish Spitz a couple of 30-minute walks daily to help him use up his energy Training these independent, strong-willed dogs can be a challenge. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. Their intelligence makes them become easily bored with repetitive training, so keep your training sessions short. Professional trainers say Finnish Spitz can be manipulative and too smart for their owners, so you need to be persistent and firm. If you stick with it, however, you"ll be greatly rewarded by your dog"s intelligence and aptitude for sports, such as obedience, agility, and rally.
Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Finnish Spitz in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Finnish Spitz, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Finnish Spitz have a double coat. The undercoat is short, soft, and dense, topped by harsh guard hairs that are one to two inches long. The hair on the head and legs is short. The tail and back of the hind legs has the longest and most dense hair. Males typically have more coat than females, especially at their shoulders. The coat comes in shades of golden-red, ranging from pale honey to deep auburn. No matter what color, their coats should be clear and bright, not muddy. Because the undercoat is a paler color than the topcoat, the dog appears to "glow" when standing in the sun. The coat is a solid color, with white markings on the tips of the toes and a quarter-size spot or narrow white strip, ideally no wider than a half-inch, on the chest. A Finnish Spitz may also have black hairs along the lip line and sparse, separate black hairs on the tail and back. Puppies often have a lot of black hairs, which decrease as they mature. The nose, lips, and rims of the eyes are always black. With weekly brushing, Finnish Spitz stay exceptionally clean. Their coats aren"t oily, so they typically don"t have an odor. They shed heavily in the spring and fall, however, and will need additional brushing during that time to keep the hair from flying around. Bathe only as needed. The Finnish Spitz is a wash-and-wear dog, meaning that no trimming should be done except under the pads of the feet. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Finnish Spitz"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Finnish Spitz jumps up to greet you. Introduce your Finnish Spitz to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Finnish Spitz love children and will tolerate a lot, walking away when they"ve had too much. They"re sturdy enough that they"re not easily injured by toddlers whose motor skills aren"t fully developed. That said, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Finnish Spitz get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re raised with them, but they can be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know. And pet birds might want to watch their back around them.
Finnish Spitz are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Finnish Spitz who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

At first glance, you might think the Flat-Coated Retriever resembles a black or brown Golden Retriever, but no such thing. He"s a distinctive breed, originally developed as a dual-purpose retriever of game on land and from water. His early popularity, which peaked before World War I, was eclipsed by that of the Golden and Labrador Retrievers, but his fans think that"s for the best, preferring to keep the secret of his fun-loving yet hard-working nature to themselves. Flat-Coats are often called the "Peter Pan" of retrievers. They generally mature more slowly than other dogs and maintain their puppylike exuberance for years. This playful energy makes them a wonderful and entertaining companion, but it also means extra time and patience when training them. While they are eager to please, Flat-Coats are hams, and they won"t hesitate to go for a laugh, even if it means ignoring or disobeying you. In general, however, he"s a responsive and sensitive student. A harsh correction will cause him to shut down until you make amends. Tolerant and friendly, Flat-Coats love everyone, including children and other dogs. They"ll bark to let you know that someone"s approaching, but don"t count on them to serve as any kind of guard dog. They are great friends for active older children but may be too energetic for toddlers, knocking them down with a swish of their frequently wagging tail. Although the Flat-Coated Retriever is fairly calm indoors, he"s not suited to apartment life. He retains his hunting skills and should live in an environment where his talents can be used--or at least one that gives him the opportunity to run and swim. Expect to give him a couple of 45-minute walks, runs, or other activity daily to satisfy his exercise needs. If you"re doing a good job, he"ll look well conditioned and lean. Afterward, he"ll enjoy relaxing with you in your home. He prefers to be with his people whenever possible. Many breeders and enthusiasts are the first to admit that Flat-Coated Retrievers are not for everyone, but there are a lucky few for whom this affectionate and good-looking retriever is a perfect match.
Beware of any breeder who advertises yellow Flat-Coated Retrievers. Flat-Coats only come in solid black or solid liver. The Flat-Coated Retriever is a high-energy dog who requires about 90 minutes of exercise a day. He makes an excellent jogging companion once he reaches physical maturity. Flat-Coated Retrievers mature at a slower rate than some other breeds and you will find that you are in possession of a rather large puppy for several years. This timeless puppy can be both a joy and a frustration. If you want a dog that is quieter and less puppy-like as an adult, you should look for another breed. Flat-Coated Retrievers enjoy human contact and will become destructive if they are left alone for too long. Routines help establish what the dog can expect and reduce their stress level. Flat-Coated Retrievers are not recommended for apartments. Training is a must with this breed as Flat-Coats are both joyous jumpers and, like all retrievers, orally fixated--that means they like to chew. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Keep training fun, interesting, and kind. With harsh verbal or physical treatment, Flat-Coats can become stubborn or stop responding altogether. Although he"s highly affectionate, the Flat-Coated Retriever is not the best choice in homes with young children or fragile senior citizens. They are unaware of their strength and can hurt people with their exuberant jumping and roughhousing. Flat-Coated Retrievers will bark an alarm, but they are not a guard or watchdog in any way. They are more likely to greet intruders warmly, happily licking their hands and face, than they are to deter them. Flat-Coated Retrievers may eat their own poop, a habit known as coprophagy. Pick up poop as soon as possible if you don"t want your Flat-Coat to snack on it. Flat-Coated Retrievers are considered to be a healthy breed in relation to other breeds but they do have a high rate of cancers. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Given the Flat-Coat"s bouncy nature, it"s appropriate that one of his forebears was named Old Bounce. Old Bounce, and her daughter, Young Bounce--natch!--were important to the development of the breed. They were members of a working strain of retrievers owned by gamekeeper J. Hull in 1864. But the man most credited with the breed"s development was S.E. Shirley, who helped mold them into a stable type. Also contributing to their advancement was H. R. Cooke, whose Riverside Kennel produced many fine field and show Flat-Coats. The Flat-Coat was a popular hunting dog through the end of World War I, but then Labrador and Golden Retrievers began to steal his thunder. His numbers became dangerously low, and he flirted with extinction a time or two. Fortunately, his fans were able to bring him back from the brink by the mid-1960s. The Flat-Coat never regained his early popularity, but breeders count that as a plus. It has helped them to preserve his natural working ability, intelligence, and sweetly goofy nature. He is still a rare breed, ranking 100th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club. If you want a Flat-Coat, expect to spend a year or more on a waiting list, not to mention undergoing the third-degree from a protective breeder who wants to make sure you will provide just the right home for one of his or her puppies.
A male Flat-Coated Retriever is 23 to 24.5 inches tall at the shoulder; a female 22 to 23.5 inches. The average weight of a Flat-Coated Retriever is 55 to 70 pounds.
Nicknamed the Peter Pan of dogs for his ever-youthful outlook on life, the Flat-Coated Retriever has many desirable qualities. He"s smart, friendly, adaptable, and cheerful. He"s also mischievous and exuberant, with a moderately high energy level. His exercise needs must be met for him to maintain the sweet, calm temperament that he"s known for. This is a slow-maturing breed, which means that he"ll act puppylike for several years beyond physical maturity. He"s a bit of a ham and will always make you laugh, even if he"s just disobeyed you. The Flat-Coat is sensitive and doesn"t respond well to harsh training methods. He may react by becoming stubborn or simply refusing to do anything you ask until you soothe his hurt feelings. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Flat-Coats need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Flat-Coat puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Flat-Coated Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Flat-Coats will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Flat-Coats, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is considered to be hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. According to the 1997 Flat-Coated Retriever Society of America health survey, CHD affected 9.4 percent of Flat-Coats reported. Malignant Histiocytosis: While this form of cancer is rare, it"s the most common type of cancer seen in Flat-Coated Retrievers. It originates in the histiocytes, white blood cells found in the skin and loose connective tissue in the body. Malignant histiocytosis is treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but the prognosis is usually poor. Lymphosarcoma: This is one of the most common cancers seen in dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer can be treated with chemotherapy. Hemangiosarcoma: This form of malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels as well as the spleen. It can be treated with surgery and chemotherapy, but the prognosis is poor. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this condition involves the knee (patella) slipping out of place, causing lameness. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis which is a degenerative joint disease. Patellar luxation can be mild or severe. Dogs with severe cases may require surgery. Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as gastric torsion or bloat: This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
The Flat-Coated Retriever is the perfect suburban or country dog. He has a moderately high energy level and is best suited to a home where he has many opportunities to run and swim. Expect to exercise him about 90 minutes a day, or two 45-minute walks, runs, or other vigorous activity such as playing fetch or training for agility or flyball. Flat-Coated Retrievers make wonderful jogging companions when they are trained properly and have reached maturity. Remember that jogging on cement or other hard surfaces can damage your dog"s joints; it"s best to run on grass or other soft surfaces. Go easy on puppies. They need approximately 5 minutes of exercise for every month of age per day. So if your Flat-Coat puppy is 4 months old, he needs about 20 minutes of exercise per day. Too much exercise can stress his still-growing joints. Your Flat-Coat shouldn"t be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, both as an aid to housetraining and to prevent your Flat-Coat from getting into things he shouldn"t when you"re not around to supervise. Your Flat-Coat is likely to have one habit you"ll find disgusting: eating poop, known as coprophagy. The only foolproof way to avoid this is to pick up his stool and dispose of it immediately. Start training your Flat-Coat as soon as you bring him home. He"s a quick learner and wants to please you. He"s sensitive, though, and harsh verbal or physical corrections will cause him to shut down and stop working for you. Be kind and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.
Recommended daily amount: 3.5 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Flat-Coat in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Flat-Coat, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Flat-Coated Retriever has a straight, moderately long coat that protects him from all types of weather, water, and ground cover. Feathering on the ears, chest, front, backs of forelegs, underside of the tail, and the thighs is part of the coat"s protective function and shouldn"t be excessively long. On the neck, especially in males, is a mane of longer, heavier coat. The coat comes in solid black or solid liver, a deep reddish-brown color. Flat-Coated Retrievers are relatively easy to maintain and require only weekly brushing unless the dog is shedding. Then you"ll probably want to brush daily to keep the amount of loose hair floating around under control. You can trim the ears, feet, belly, and tail tip for neatness. Bathe as needed. Brush your Flat-Coat"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Flat-Coat enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Flat-Coat to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Flat-Coats are great friends for active older children. They"ll play for hours, whether that involves running, swimming, or chasing a ball. They can be overwhelming for toddlers, however, accidentally knocking them over with one whack of that ever-wagging tail. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Flat-Coats enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats, especially if they"re raised with them. They might be a little too fond of pet birds, if you know what we mean.

Fox Terriers are canine classics who"ve changed little since their emergence in the late 18th century. There are two types: Smooth Fox Terriers are sleek, elegant, and intelligent, while Wire Fox Terriers are handsome, happy, and quite stylish when groomed properly. Called Fox Terriers or Foxys for short, both are outgoing, active, and inquisitive, with a devil-may-care attitude. They live in the moment, enjoying whatever"s going on. Smooth Fox Terriers are not very common these days outside of hunting and show circles, but they"re important because many other terrier breeds are believed to have descended from them. The Smooth Fox Terrier also holds the distinction of being the first breed in the fox terrier group to be officially recognized by England"s Kennel Club in 1875. Historically, Fox Terriers were used to "bolt" foxes when they ran into their hiding places and drive them toward the foxhounds and hunters. White Smooth Fox Terriers were highly prized because they were less likely to be mistaken for the fox. Wires were favored for hunting in rough country, their coats making them less vulnerable to injury than their smooth-coated counterparts. Although Fox Terriers seldom are used for hunting now, they still have a strong prey drive and will dig with reckless abandon after underground vermin. Hardy and healthy, Fox Terriers generally live well into their teens. Their handy 15- to 20-pound size makes them small enough to take just about anywhere but big enough for rough and tumble play. Their fiery disposition is evident in their small, dark eyes. These are bold and energetic dogs that love to play with children. They"re loyal to their families but impulsively scrappy with other dogs, never hesitating to pick fights, even with much bigger dogs. Unless they"ve been trained and socialized to get along with other family pets, they shouldn"t be trusted alone with them. Fox Terriers have a lot of self-confidence and love to explore. Never turn your Fox Terrier out in an unsecured area without a leash, and periodically check your fence to make sure he hasn"t been digging an escape route. Because they"re so intelligent, Fox Terriers are naturals for obedience, agility, and earth trials. They also can learn tricks easily. Like most terriers, they"re willful and need firm (not harsh), consistent training methods. Because of their smarts and stamina, they need plenty of mental and physical stimulation to keep them from resorting to destructive behaviors such as excessive barking, chewing, digging, and chasing other animals. Exercise, exercise, and more exercise is the key. A tired Fox Terrier is a good Fox Terrier. Unfortunately, you"ll probably be tired before he is. Fox Terriers make excellent watchdogs. So long as their barking isn"t triggered by being left alone for too long in the yard by themselves, you should take comfort in knowing that your Fox Terrier will sound an alarm if he hears or sees something amiss in his territory. Your Fox Terrier will always be on the job of guarding your home and family. With their outgoing, self-assured personalities, Fox Terriers can get into lots of mischief, including raiding the kitchen table and breaking out of the yard. They love toys and balls, and many adore playing in the water. While Fox Terrier puppies are difficult to resist, be aware that when grown, they"ll need a lot of attention and stimulation to keep them out of trouble. If you can stay a step or two ahead of them, though, they"re lively and long-lived companions.
Fox Terriers like to eat and can become overweight. Be sure to monitor their food intake and give them regular exercise to keep them in shape. Fox Terriers can be hard to housetrain — crate training is recommended. Fox Terriers bark a lot and their barks typically are high-pitched. Fox Terriers are prone to chasing rabbits, birds, cats, and even other dogs. They"re scrappy and will pick fights with other dogs, even those that are much larger than they are. Be sure to keep your Fox Terrier on leash when he"s not in a secure area. Fox Terriers should not be trusted alone with non-canine pets unless they have been trained to get along with them. Fox Terriers are highly energetic and need about 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise each day. If they don"t get a chance to burn off their natural energy, they can become destructive or turn into nuisance barkers. While they"re loyal to their families and love to play, Fox Terriers are too rough and energetic to play with young children. Fox Terriers are escape artists. They can jump higher than you might think and will dig holes or otherwise try to escape from their yards. Fox Terriers are a fairly rare breed. If you"re buying a puppy, you may find it hard to track down a good breeder — and even when you find one, you may have to wait several months for a litter to be born.
Fox Terriers have a lot of history behind them. They"ve been companions to kings, entertained the masses in circuses and film, and won more Best-in-Show awards at the Westminster Kennel Club show than any other breed. When fox hunting became popular in England in the late 18th century, hunters quickly discovered that they needed a dog that could "go to ground" (enter foxes" dens) and "bolt" the foxes to drive them out of their hiding places. And so the Smooth Fox Terrier was developed. While breeders didn"t keep many records about the development of the breed, it"s likely that the original Smooth Fox Terriers were a blend of black and tan terriers with smooth coats, Bull Terriers, Greyhounds, and Beagles. In 1790, a Colonel Thornton had a portrait painted of his dog Pitch, a Smooth Fox Terrier, which gives us an idea of what the early dogs looked like. They"ve changed little since then. Well-known Smooths of the 19th century who contributed to the breed"s development were Old Jock, born in 1859 at Grove Kennel in England, and Belgrave Joe. By the late 19th century, uniform type had been established. For many years, Smooths and Wires were considered one breed of two varieties. Their main difference is coat type and, to some extent, head shape. Despite their similarities in size, shape and temperament, they likely had different ancestry. Wires are thought to have descended from rough-coated black and tan terriers from Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. Early breeders liberally crossed Wire Fox Terriers with Smooths to give the Wires more white pigmentation, a cleaner-cut head, and a more classical outline. This interbreeding no longer continues, however, and has not for many years. Smooth Fox Terriers entered the show ring about 15 to 20 years before Wire Fox Terriers, and at first they were classified with sporting dogs. England"s Fox Terrier Club was founded in 1876. The members drew up a breed standard that remained unchanged for decades, with the exception of reducing the weight of a male dog in show condition from 20 pounds to 18 pounds. Caesar, a Wire Fox Terrier, was beloved of England"s King Edward VII. He wore a collar with the inscription "I am Caesar. I belong to the King." When Edward died in 1910, a grieving Caesar marched behind his casket in the funeral procession. The first records of Smooth Fox Terriers being imported to the U.S. date to 1879, with Wire Fox Terriers being imported a few years later. The American Fox Terrier Club, the parent club of the breed in this country, was founded in 1885 and has the distinction of being the first specialty club to become a member of the American Kennel Club. The first Fox Terrier to be registered by the AKC was Cricket, in 1885. The AFTC adopted the English breed standard when it was formed, and it wasn"t until a century later that separate standards for the two breeds went into effect. They are still quite similar in their descriptions. In the 1920s, the Smooth Fox Terrier became one of the most recognized of purebred dogs when RCA used in its logo a picture of a Smooth Fox Terrier named Nipper, head cocked, listening to a record machine. Wire Fox Terriers became popular as family pets in the 1930s, when a film series called The Thin Man was created. A Wire Fox Terrier named Asta was a regular in the show, and the popularity of the breed soared. In 1985, the AKC formally recognized the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wire Fox Terrier as separate breeds, but the standards for both are still maintained by the American Fox Terrier Club. Wire and Smooth Fox Terriers are uncommon breeds, ranking 78th and 102nd among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC. While they might not be seen frequently in homes, they are stars in the show ring, with Wire Fox Terriers carrying off 13 Best-in-Show awards at Westminster and Smooths four, making them together the winningest breeds there.
Male Fox Terriers are no taller than 15.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh 17 to 19 pounds. Females are proportionately smaller and weigh 15 to 17 pounds.
These dogs are alert, lively, and smart. They"re also prone to mischief, being charming but sly. A Fox Terrier can outwit you, yet leave you laughing at his antics. Their vigilant nature makes them excellent watchdogs, but it also means they tend to be nuisance barkers. Outgoing and inquisitive, Fox Terriers are friendly toward people but don"t hesitate pick a fight with other dogs. That means they"re not great candidates for the dog park. Like every dog, Fox Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Fox Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Fox Terriers are a hardy breed in general, with no major health concerns. However, some dogs are affected by the following conditions. Not all Fox Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Fox Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. Deafness is often a problem with predominantly white dogs. Living with and training a deaf dog requires patience and time, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier. Because this is a hereditary problem, you should notify the breeder so he or she can make changes in the breeding program. Cataracts are an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Legg-Perthes disease is generally a disease of small breeds, and this condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Lens Luxation is when the lens of the eye becomes displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It"s sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed. Canine Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Veterinary care includes supplements and medications to help lessen the pain of arthritis and, in some cases, surgery.
Just because he"s small doesn"t mean the Fox Terrier is suited to apartment life. He really needs a securely fenced yard (think Fort Knox) where he can run off all that energy during the day. And don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Fox Terrier in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey — cats, rabbits, cars. Keep your Fox Terrier on leash when in unfenced areas. He has a strong hunting instinct and will chase anything that moves. He will also try to pick fights with other dogs, so he"s not a good candidate for visiting dog parks. Early socialization is important to help prevent aggression toward other dogs. Give your Fox Terrier at least 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble. Although they"re highly intelligent, they"re also willful, so Fox Terriers can be challenging to train. Be patient and keep your sense of humor handy. They thrive on consistency and routine, so providing clear rules and enforcing them in a firm and positive way will produce the most progress. Once you"ve unlocked the secret to motivating them, they can learn anything you can teach.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Fox Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Fox Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Smooth Fox Terriers have smooth, hard, dense coats that shed very little. The coat of the Wire Fox Terrier is also dense but wiry, reminiscent of the matting on a coconut — the ideal look is for the hairs to twist, making them look broken. The coat can be crinkly or have a slight wave. The hair should be so dense that you can"t part it with your fingers to see the skin. At the base of these stiff hairs is the undercoat, which is short, fine, and soft. White was a prized color in both Smooth and Wire Fox Terriers, because it made it easier to spot the dogs when hunting. Today, breed standards — the written description of what a breed should look like — say white should be the predominant color in both Smooth and Wiry Fox Terriers. They can have black, tan, or black and tan markings. Heads usually are solid-colored, but the breed standard allows for markings on their faces, such as a half or split face, a blaze, or color only over the eyes and ears. Brindle, red, liver, or (in Wires) slate-blue markings aren"t desirable in the show ring. Those markings don"t affect any less of a good companion, but you shouldn"t pay extra for them because they"re "rare." Smooth Fox Terriers need only occasional brushing with a firm bristle brush to keep them looking neat. Regular baths aren"t necessary — only when they roll in something gross. Wire Fox Terriers don"t shed very much, but they should also be brushed regularly to keep their coats clean and odor-free. To get the coat texture Wire Fox Terriers are known for, the coat needs to be hand stripped — meaning the hair is plucked out rather than cut with scissors or clippers. This is a job that most people turn over to a professional groomer, although you can learn to do it yourself. Another option is to have your dog"s coat clipped. You should know, however, that clipping the coat changes the wiry texture, making the coat feel soft, and may cause the colors to look pale. Give your Fox Terrier regular nail trims. If you can hear nails clicking on the floor, bring out the clippers. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Fox Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.
Fox Terriers are children at heart themselves and love playing with kids, but they"re too active for a child younger than 6 or 7 years old. They play rough, and children"s high-pitched voices and tendency to run can make them look like prey, inciting the Fox Terrier to bite in excitement. Fox Terriers can also be protective of their food and toys, which can cause problems. As with all dogs, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party. Don"t leave dogs and young children alone together. Fox Terriers may be fine with dogs or cats they"ve been raised with since puppyhood, but they"re not the best choice for homes with pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and guinea pigs. Those animals look just a little too much like lunch for them to be safe around a Fox Terrier.
Fox Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Fox Terriers end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Fox Terrier who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

Bat-eared but oddly beautiful, the French Bulldog has a unique appeal. Aesthetically, other breeds undeniably are more glamorous and showy, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder and what many behold in the French Bulldog are the attributes that make this breed one of the best companion dogs in the world today.The French Bulldog is small but substantial in build with a powerful muscular body. He sports a short easy-care coat to accompany his easygoing personality. The Frenchie likes to play, but he also enjoys spending his days relaxing on the sofa.That love of play and relaxed attitude carry over into their training sessions. French Bulldogs are intelligent, and training them is easy as long as you make it seem like a game and keep it fun. They are free thinkers and are not an ideal breed for competing in obedience or agility although some have risen to the challenge. This freethinking approach can also lead to a stubborn nature, and if they decide to dig in their heels there is no budging them.Frenchies are loving companions who thrive on human contact. If you want an outdoor dog who can be left alone for long periods, the Frenchie is not the breed for you. This is a dog who enjoys lavishing love on his human companions as much as he loves the same treatment in return. They generally get along well with everyone, including children. They can, however, be territorial and possessive of their people, especially in the presence of other dogs. Socialization is a must for this breed, but with their easy companionship this is an enjoyable task.With a nature that is both humorous and mischievous, the French Bulldog needs to live with someone who is consistent, firm, and patient with all the antics and idiosyncrasies that make him both frustrating and delightful.French Bulldogs make excellent watchdogs and will alert their people to approaching strangers, but it"s not their style to bark without cause. They can be protective of their home and family and some will try to defend both with their life.French Bulldogs do not need a lot of room and do very well in apartments or small dwellings. A couple of 15-minute walks per day should keep them from becoming overweight. Keep the Frenchie in cool, comfortable surroundings. He"s susceptible to heat exhaustion and needs an air-conditioned environment. This is not a dog who can stay outside on a hot day.French Bulldogs are wonderful companion dogs with a gentle nature. If you work at home, the Frenchie is happy to lie at your feet all day or follow you from room to room. People who love them describe them as mischievous goof balls and can"t imagine life without them. They are a constant presence, and they"ll love you with all the strength in their small bodies, proving time and again that beauty is on the inside.
French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise, but they do need daily walks to keep them at a healthy weight. French Bulldogs do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overexert themselves. French Bulldogs can be easy to train, but they can also be stubborn. Be firm and patient when training this breed. If you value cleanliness the French Bulldog may not be the dog for you, since he is prone to drooling, flatulence and some shedding. He can also be difficult to housetrain. French Bulldogs can be a quiet breed and are not known as a breed that barks frequently although there are exceptions to every rule. Because they don"t tend to be excessive barkers, French Bulldogs make exceptional apartment dogs. Although it is important to always supervise young children and dogs when they are together, the French Bulldog does very well with children. French Bulldogs make wonderful watchdogs, but they can become territorial. They also like being the center of attention, which can lead to behavioral problems if they are overindulged. French Bulldogs are companion dogs and thrive when they have human contact. They are not a breed that can be left alone for long periods or left outside to live. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The French Bulldog originated in England and was created to be a toy-size version of the Bulldog. The breed was quite popular among lace workers in the city of Nottingham and when many lace workers emigrated to France for better opportunities, they naturally brought their little bulldogs with them.The French Bulldog thrived in France and Europe, and his charm was soon discovered by Americans as well. The United States saw its first French Bulldog at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1896. The breed was quickly nicknamed "Frenchie," and it is still an affectionate name that is used today.
Generally a French Bulldog is about 11 to 12 inches tall. Males weigh 20 to 28 pounds, females 16 to 24 pounds.
This is a smart, loving dog who wants and needs to spend lots of time with his people. A fun-loving freethinker, the French Bulldog takes well to training when it"s done in a positive manner with lots of food rewards, praise, and play.
Not all Frenchies will get any or all of these diseases, butit"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Brachycephalic Syndrome: This disorder is found in dogs with short heads, narrowed nostrils, or elongated or soft palates. Their airways are obstructed to varying degrees and can cause anything from noisy or labored breathing to total collapse of the airway. Dogs with brachycephalic syndrome commonly snuffle and snort. Treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition but includes oxygen therapy as well as surgery to widen nostrils or shorten palates. Allergies: Allergies are a common problem in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies. Hemivertebrae: This is a malformation of one or more vertebrae that causes it to be shaped like a wedge or triangle. This malformation can occur on its own or with other vertebrae malformations. Hemivertebra can cause no problems, or it can put pressure on the spinal cord. This can lead to pain, weakness, and or paralysis. There is no treatment for the condition unless there is spinal cord pressure. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and slips in and out of place (luxates). This causes lameness or an abnormal gait (the way the dog moves). It is a congenital disease, meaning it"s present at birth, although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): IDD occurs when a disc in the spine ruptures or herniates and pushes upward into the spinal cord. When the disc pushes into the spinal cord, nerve transmissions are inhibited from traveling along the spinal cord. Intervertebral Disc Disease can be caused by trauma, age, or simply from the physical jolt that occurs when a dog jumps off a sofa. When the disc ruptures, the dog usually feels pain and the ruptured disc can lead to weakness and temporary or permanent paralysis. Treatment usually involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) made specially for dogs. Never give your dog Tylenol or other NSAIDs made for people as they can be toxic. In some cases surgery can help, but it must be done within a day or so of the injury. You may also want to ask your veterinarian about physical rehabilitation. Treatments such as massage, water treadmills and electrical stimulation are available for dogs and can have excellent success. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian. Elongated Soft Palate: The soft palate is the extension of the roof of the mouth. When the soft palate is elongated, it can obstruct airways and cause difficulty in breathing. The treatment for Elongated Soft Palate is surgical removal of the excess palate.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Frenchies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise. They have fairly low energy levels, although there are exceptions to every rule. To keep their weight down, however, they need daily exercise through short walks or play times in the yard. Many French Bulldogs enjoy playing and will spend much of their time in various activities, but they are not so high energy that they need a large yard or long periods of exercise. This breed is prone to heat exhaustion and should not be exercised in hot temperatures. Limit walks and active play to cool mornings and evenings.When training a French Bulldog, take into account that although they are intelligent and usually eager to please, they are also free thinkers. That means they can be stubborn. Many different training techniques are successful with this breed, so don"t give up if a certain method doesn"t work; just try a different technique. To pique your Frenchie"s interest, try to make training seem like a game with lots of fun and prizes.It is important to crate train your French Bulldog puppy even if you plan to give him the freedom of the house when he reaches adulthood. Regardless of breed, puppies explore, get into things they shouldn"t, and chew things that can harm them. It can be expensive both to repair or replace destroyed items and to pay the vet bills that could arise, so crate training benefits your wallet and your temper as well as your puppy"s well being.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Frenchie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The coat of the French Bulldog is short, smooth, shiny, and fine. The skin is loose and wrinkled, especially at the head and shoulders, and has a soft texture.French Bulldogs come in a variety of colors, including fawn, cream, various shades of brindle — a coat patterned with specks and streaks of light and dark markings — such as black brindle and the striking tiger brindle, and brindle and white, known as brindle pied. French Bulldogs can be any color except solid black, liver (a solid reddish-brown with brown pigmentation on the lips and nose), mouse (a light steely gray), and black with white or tan.Run from any breeder who tells you that a particular color is rare and thus worth more money. Conversely, remember that you can"t just order up a puppy of a particular color and gender. Having your heart set on a fawn female is a recipe for disappointment when the litter contains only cream and brindle males.French Bulldogs are fairly easy to groom and need only an occasional brushing to keep their coat healthy. They are average shedders. Begin grooming your Frenchie at a young age and teach your puppy to stand on a table or floor to make this experience easier on both of you. When you are grooming your Frenchie at any stage of life, take the time to check for any scabs, skin lesions, bare spots, rough, flaky skin, or signs of infections. You should also check ears, eyes and teeth for any discharge or bad smells. Both are signs that your Frenchie may need to see the veterinarian.Clean ears regularly with a damp warm cloth and run a cotton swab around the edge of the canal. Never stick the cotton swab into the actual ear canal. If the edges of the ears are dry, apply mineral or baby oil sparingly. The oil can also be used on a dry nose.French Bulldogs do not naturally wear their nails down and will need their nails trimmed regularly. This prevents splitting and tearing, which can be painful for the dog.Keep the facial wrinkles clean and dry to prevent bacterial infections. Whenever you bathe your dog, take the time to thoroughly dry the skin between the folds. Bathe your French Bulldog monthly or as needed, and use a high-quality dog shampoo to keep the natural oils in his skin and coat.French Bulldogs should be easy to groom, and with proper training and positive experiences during puppyhood, grooming can be a wonderful bonding time for you and your Frenchie. If you"re uncomfortable with any aspect of grooming, such as trimming nails, take your dog to a professional groomer who understands the needs of French Bulldogs.
Frenchies get along well with children, and they"re not so tiny that they can"t live in a household with a toddler. That said, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child. It"s just common sense to supervise and make sure that neither is poking or otherwise harassing the other.When they are socialized to them during puppyhood, Frenchies can get along well with other dogs and cats. Overly spoiled Frenchies, however, may be jealous toward other dogs, especially if those other dogs are getting attention from the Frenchie"s very own person.
French Bulldogs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an Frenchie, a rescue group is a good place to start. French Bulldog Connection Rescue French Bulldog Rescue Network French Bulldog Fanciers of Canada

The German Pinscher has the energy and drive of all working breeds, but he"s also an outstanding companion. He loves being with his family and will meld himself into every facet of your life. The German Pinscher"s playfulness will continue well into adulthood, and he may continue to disembowel squeaky toys long past teething (dental floss is the best repair tool). When German Pinchers are in a spot of trouble at home, some will look you right in the eye and smile, showing their teeth in a big grin. The German Pinscher was originally developed as a working dog who hunted and killed vermin (that means he"ll still nail them today, so he"s not going to be good in a home with pet rodents). Today, he still has the energy of a working breed and has proved himself to be an all-around kind of guy when it comes to canine sports and careers. You can find German Pinschers in the conformation ring, at obedience rallies or agility trials, and at work in tracking. He also works as a service dog, therapy dog, and as a pampered pet who enjoys the comforts of family life. He can be assertive and overbearing, and he"ll take over your heart and home in a matter of seconds. Don"t kid yourself: he needs a firm, experienced owner who is consistent in training and good at establishing rules right from the beginning. If you tend to wimp out or you want a placid dog, find another breed — this one will walk all over you. However, he will also be completely, utterly, and permanently devoted to you. This devotion supports his ability to be an excellent guard dog. Despite an independent streak, he likes to be in the middle of all family activities, right there with you. The German Pinscher will alert bark with a strong voice. If any intruder risks entering your home, this dog will defend it with everything he"s got. And he"s quite capable of taking care of an intruder: While he"s not the largest guard dog around, maxing out at about 45 pounds, he"s incredibly skillful at the job. Given that he looks like a small Doberman Pinscher or a humongous Miniature Pinscher (he was a foundation dog for both of those breeds), and that he"s suspicious of strangers, he can make some people nervous. He will accept your friends without problems; it"s the folks you don"t know who might hear that strong voice he"s famous for, the one that sounds like it"s coming from a much bigger dog. He saves that voice for special occasions. A German Pinscher is intelligent and quick to learn, and he can reach all levels of training and competition. He also has a personality that will test limits (both his own and yours). Apartments make adequate homes if you properly exercise your German Pinscher, but it isn"t his ideal situation. He does better with a yard to run in--a properly fenced yard, to prevent any escape-artist tendencies. He has a strong prey drive and will chase any animal deemed interesting (unfortunately, you are not the one doing the deeming). He must be trained — start him at a young age. Since he"s so intelligent, the task isn"t difficult, even though he isn"t as eager to please you as are some breeds; he really needs a firm and consistent owner. Use positive reinforcement and establish consistent rules, because German Pinschers are known for their strong temperament — given half a chance, he"ll take control of the house. But if you take the time and effort, the end result of training the German Pinscher is worth all the time it takes. For one thing, you don"t want to end up living with a strong, wary, protective dog who"s out of control; for another, it"s highly satisfying to train such a smart and capable canine. Socialization is just as important as obedience training for the German Pinscher, and it helps avoid aggressiveness. As a puppy he should be socialized to other dogs, puppies, adults, and children. Most obedience schools offer socialization classes, and he can also run errands with you, take long walks, go to the dog park, and have playdates with canine friends and two-legged children. Although a German Pinscher is a loving family companion, he"s not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine because of his strong and assertive nature. This can be overpowering even to some adults, but especially to a child. However, if he"s the dog for you, then there"s no denying that the happy, loving, intelligent German Pinscher will make your family, life, and home complete.
The German Pinscher is not recommended for homes with children under the age of nine. A working breed, he needs daily exercise and cannot be left untrained or unexercised. Expect a healthy amount of exercise each day to curb negative behaviors. The German Pinscher can fare all right in an apartment as long as he"s walked at least twice a day. However, he"s better suited to a home that has a fenced yard. He has a strong prey drive and will chase anything that he deems worth chasing. He should be kept on lead while not in a secured area, and fences should be secure enough that he can"t slip through them. The German Pinscher is a strong-willed breed that needs a consistent and firm owner. He has been known to take over a home if rules are not set when he"s young. With training and consistency, however, the German Pinscher will learn quickly and well. Naturally suspicious of strangers, the German Pinschers makes an excellent guard dog. By the same token, he needs to be socialized from a young age to prevent the development of aggressive behavior. The German Pinscher enjoys jumping up to greet loved ones, but proper training can correct this trait. He will alert bark and he has a strong, loud voice, but he won"t bark unnecessarily. He thrives when he"s part of a family and can participate in family activities. He isn"t a breed who can live outside, and he"s unhappy being forgotten while life is busy. The German Pinscher can become destructive when he"s bored. He"s also known for his ability to gut toys at an alarming rate. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Originally developed to eradicate vermin, the German Pinscher originated in Germany somewhere between the late 1700s and late 1800s. There is no clear evidence of when he was developed, but a painting that dates from about 1780 portrays a dog similar in appearance to the German Pinscher. He was a foundation dog for many breeds, including the Doberman Pinscher and the Miniature Pinscher. The breed was founded by the Rat Pinscher, also known as the Rat Catcher or the Great Ratter, a breed that became extinct in the early 1800s. The German Pinscher was recognized as a breed in 1895. During the World Wars, the German Pinscher came close to extinction. Two breed colors did in fact die out: the pure black and the salt-and-pepper. After World War II, a West German named Werner Jung began breeding German Pinschers and saved the breed. German Pinschers were first imported into the United States in the late 1970s.
The German Pinscher is a squarely built, muscular, medium-sized dog. The average height is between 17 to 20 inches for both males and females. They usually weigh between 25 and 45 pounds.
The German Pinscher is strong-willed, devoted, and in need of a consistent and firm owner. He can take over a home if rules are not set when he"s young. With training and consistency, German Pinschers will learn quickly. Naturally suspicious of strangers, he is an excellent guard dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the German Pinscher needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Pinscher puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. He"s like a mischievous kid who will test your boundaries. Sure, he"ll housetrain quickly, and he"s quite trainable in other respects as well, but he wants to know what he can get away with. You need mental and physical strength to control a German Pinscher and gain his respect. He must have a strong leader whose authority is tempered with patience and respect. If you aren"t a calm person or are unable to say no and truly mean it, or you"re not really interested in taking on in-depth training, look elsewhere.
German Pinschers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all German Pinschers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In German Pinschers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.
German Pinschers are active and need daily exercise either through a good run in the backyard or two long walks on lead. Supervise your German Pinscher when exercising, since he"ll go bounding off after anything that"s worth chasing. He"ll be all right in an apartment if given enough exercise, but he prefers a home with a fenced yard in which he can play. He isn"t suited to living outdoors full-time in a kennel or dog run, however; he thrives being with his family. He"s a working breed and enjoys having a job to do. An unstimulated, untrained, and unexercised German Pinscher can head down a scary path of boredom and destruction. Give him something to work on while you"re gone, such as interactive toys or Kongs with frozen peanut butter. He"s no couch potato, content to lounge about all day enjoying bonbons. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your German Pinscher doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. Like many other dogs, a German Pinscher can be destructive as a pup, and when even when he enters adulthood. Crate training is for his own safety. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Pinscher accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Pinscher in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. He isn"t meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel. Exercise, training, and laying down house rules for your German Pinscher all will help ensure that your companion is well behaved. It alleviates stress for you and him and provides opportunities to bond.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Pinscher in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your German Pinscher, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The coat should be shiny and smooth in texture, short and dense with no bald spots. The German Pinscher sports a variety of colors, including various shades of red, stag red (in which there are black hairs intermingled with the red), and Isabella (a light bay or fawn color). German Pinschers can also be black or blue with tan or red markings. The German Pinscher is an average shedder and requires minimal grooming. Brushing his coat with a cloth or rubber mitt about once a week will get rid of any excess hair. Brush your German Pinscher"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your German Pinscher to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The German Pinscher usually does well with children if he"s brought up with them from puppyhood. But because of his assertive nature, he does best with older children, preferably those over the age of nine. An older Pinscher who"s unfamiliar with children will probably do best in a home with kids who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should be left unsupervised with a child. The same holds true for the German Pinscher"s attitude toward some kinds of pets; he does best if he"s been raised with them, or at least socialized to them when he"s still young. But remember that he was developed to hunt and kill vermin. He"s got a high prey drive that"s hardwired, and no amount of training will keep him from going after a pet rat. He"s not a good match with small mammals.
German Pinschers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Pinschers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a German Pinscher rescue. German Pinscher Club Rescue

The German Shepherd Dog, also known as the Alsatian in Great Britain and parts of Europe, is among the top 10 most popular dog breeds in the U.S., and probably one of the world"s most recognized breeds.He owes part of his renown to a small puppy who was plucked from a bullet- and bomb-riddled breeding kennel in France during World War I by Corporal Lee Duncan. At the end of the war Duncan brought the puppy back to his hometown of Los Angeles, trained him, and turned him into one of the most famous dogs in show biz: Rin Tin Tin. Rin Tin Tin went on to appear in dozens of movies and, at the height of his stardom, got 10,000 fan letters a week.The German Shepherd has held many jobs other than movie star: leading the blind, chasing down criminals, sniffing out illegal substances, serving in the military, visiting the sick, and herding stock are just some of the jobs held by this versatile breed.The dog has even taken on the role of national hero. German Shepherds were the search and rescue dogs crawling through the ruins of the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, looking for survivors and comforting rescue workers and families.The German Shepherd may embody some of the best traits of dogs, but he"s not for everyone. Originally bred to herd flocks all day, this is a high-energy dog who needs a lot of activity and exercise. Without it, he"s likely to express his boredom and frustration in ways you don"t like, such as barking and chewing.The breed also has an aloof and sometimes suspicious nature — great for a watchdog but not the sort of family dog who"ll make guests feel welcome. But if you expose a German Shepherd to many different situations and people starting in puppyhood, he can learn to take new people and circumstances in stride.If you"re buying a puppy, you"ll get a slightly different kind of German Shepherd depending on whether you choose an American versus a German breeder. In general, American breeders are often aiming to create dog show champions, and they breed puppies more for that distinctive German Shepherd look than for those distinctive German Shepherd talents.Fans say that American-bred German Shepherds are calmer than their German counterparts, but critics say these dogs have lost some of their talents for working traditional German Shepherd jobs, and are more prone to behavior problems such as separation anxiety.German breeders, on the other hand, breed German Shepherds for their working abilities as well as to fit the breed"s traditional look. Before a German Shepherd is bred in Germany, he has to pass numerous tests to prove he measures up to the physical and mental benchmarks the breed is known for. German Shepherd Dogs from Germany tend to have a more energetic and driven personality.
German Shepherds isn"t the breed for you if you"re away from home frequently or for long periods of time. When left alone they can become anxious or bored, and are likely to express their worry in ways you don"t like — barking, chewing, and digging. The German Shepherd is an active and intelligent dog. He must be kept busy learning, playing, and working. Daily exercise, both physical (such as jogging and Frisbee) and mental (such as training sessions), is a must. German Shepherds can be aloof and suspicious of strangers. To raise a social and well-behaved dog, expose your German Shepherd puppy to many experiences, places, and people. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is important for getting him used to other people and dogs, as well as teaching him basic canine manners. These dogs shed, shed, shed — in fact, their nickname is the "German shedder." Brush him several times a week and buy a good vacuum. You"ll need it. Crate training is not only a wonderful way to housetrain a puppy, it helps teach him to be calm and happy when separated from his owner. This is especially important for the German Shepherd, who sometimes suffers separation anxiety, or extreme anxiety when left alone. He"s got a reputation for being a great watchdog — and he is — but the German Shepherd should never be chained or tethered just to stand guard. No dog should; it leads to frustration and aggression. The German Shepherd is happiest living indoors with the family, but with access to a large, fenced yard, where he can burn off some of his natural energy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed, dating back to 1899, and he owes his existence to one man: Captain Max von Stephanitz, a career captain in the German cavalry with a goal of creating a German breed that would be unmatched as a herding dog.Centuries before von Stephanitz came along, farmers in Germany, as in the rest of Europe, relied on dogs to drive and protect their herds. Some dogs were legendary for their skill, and sheepherders would travel days to breed their female dogs to a notable sire. However, as von Stephanitz noted, no one had developed the herding dogs of the region into a distinct breed.In 1898, von Stephanitz retired from military life and began his second career, and what would prove to be his passion: experimenting with dog breeding to create a superior German herding dog. Stephanitz studied the breeding techniques of the British, noted for their exceptional herding dogs, and traveled throughout Germany, attending dog shows and observing German-type herding dogs.Von Stephanitz saw many fine herding dogs, dogs who were athletic, or intelligent, or capable. What he didn"t see was a dog who embodied all those traits.One day, in 1899, von Stephanitz was visiting a dog show when a wolfish-looking dog caught his eye. He immediately bought the dog, named Hektor Linksrhein. Later renamed Horand v Grafeth, the dog"s powerful physique and intelligence so impressed von Stephanitz that he formed a society — the Verein fur deutsche Schaferhunde — to found a breed out of Horand"s descendents.Although he had intended for his breed to work as herding dogs, as Germany became more and more industrialized, von Stephanitz saw the need for such dogs fading. He was determined that his breed would continue as a working dog, and he decided that the dog"s future was in police work and military service.Making good use of his military connections, von Stephanitz convinced the German government to use the breed. During World War I the German Shepherd served as a Red Cross dog, messenger, rescuer, guard, supply carrier, and sentry.Although German Shepherds made their way to the United States before the war, it wasn"t until the war that the breed became popular in the U.S. Allied servicemen noted the dog"s bravery and intelligence, and a number of dogs went home with these soldiers.One such dog was a five-day-old puppy plucked from a bomb-riddled kennel in France by an American corporal from Los Angeles. The corporal took the puppy home, trained him, and turned him into one of Hollywood"s most recognizable four-legged stars: Rin Tin Tin, who appeared in 26 movies and helped popularize the breed in America.Although the Allies were impressed by the German dogs, they weren"t so happy with the dog"s German roots. During wartime all things German were stigmatized, and in 1917, the American Kennel Club (AKC) changed the breed"s name to the Shepherd Dog.In England, the dog was renamed the Alsatian Wolf Dog, after the German-French border area of Alsace-Lorraine. The AKC went back to using the original name of German Shepherd Dog in 1931; it took until 1977 for the British Kennel Club to do the same.Von Stephanitz stayed closely involved with the development of the breed, and as early as 1922, he became alarmed by some of the traits that were turning up in the dogs, such as poor temperament and a tendency to tooth decay. He developed a system of tight quality control: Before any individual German Shepherd was bred, he needed to pass numerous tests of his intelligence, temperament, athleticism, and good health.American breeding of German Shepherds, on the other hand, wasn"t nearly so regulated. In the United States, the dogs were bred to win dog shows, and breeders put more emphasis on looks and on the dogs" gait, or way of moving.After World War II, American- and German-bred German Shepherds began to diverge dramatically. At one point, the U.S. police departments and military began importing German Shepherd working dogs, because homegrown German Shepherds were failing performance tests and plagued by genetic health conditions.In the past few decades, some American breeders have begun to put the emphasis back on the breed"s abilities rather than just appearance, importing working dogs from Germany to add to their breeding program. It"s now possible to buy American-bred German Shepherds that live up to the breed"s reputation as a capable working dog.
Males stand 24 to 26 inches; females stand 22 to 24 inches. Weight ranges from 75 to 95 pounds.
The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. He"s a reserved dog; he doesn"t make friends immediately, but once he does, he"s extremely loyal. With his family he"s easy-going and approachable, but when threatened he can be strong and protective, making him an excellent watchdog.This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do — any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim.One thing he"s not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship he needs — as well as exercise and the chance to put his intelligence to work — he becomes bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who"s under-exercised and ignored by his family is likely to express his pent-up energy in ways you don"t like, such as barking and chewing.Like every dog, the German Shepherd needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
German Shepherds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all German Shepherds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In German Shepherds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Degenerative Myelopathy: Degenerative myelopathy is a progressive disease of the spinal cord, specifically the part of the cord that communicates information to the brain regarding the hind legs. Dogs with DM act as though they don"t know where their back legs are, and cannot move them properly. The disease progresses to the point the dog cannot walk. Most of the time, there is no treatment and the dog is put to sleep. However, in a few rare cases, the condition is related to a lack of vitamin-12 or vitamin E. If this is the case, vitamin supplements might stabilize the condition.Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: EPI is a genetic disease of the pancreas in which the cells that produce digestive enzymes are destroyed. As a result, the dog can no longer digest and absorb food. The first signs of the condition are gas, loss of appetite, weight loss, and change in stools. The dog becomes very thin, and very hungry. EPI is diagnosed with a simple blood test, and treatment is simple, too: pancreatic enzymes are added to the dog"s food. With proper medication supervision, most dogs recover.Allergies: Some German Shepherds suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. Allergy symptoms in dogs are similar to those in people. If your German Shepherd is scratching, licking at his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect that it has an allergy and have him checked by your vet.
Originally bred to herd flocks all day, German Shepherds are built for action. This means he"s got lots of energy that he needs to burn off with daily exercise.If you leave him alone for long periods of time without exercise, expect trouble. Boredom and inactivity lead to behavior problems — chewing, digging, and barking. The German Shepherd desperately needs to exercise both his body (jogging, a romp at the dog park) and his mind (training exercises like agility or obedience competitions).Like many herding breeds, German Shepherds are barkers. Barking isn"t necessarily a problem, but it can be if the dog is bored. Learning the "Quiet" command should be part of every German Shepherd"s obedience training.German Shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. If they pick the wrong thing to gnaw on, they can damage their teeth, swallow something that makes them sick, or even choke. Save your dog, and your belongings, by giving him safe chew toys and bones so he can entertain himself when you"re not playing with him.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.If your dog starts to put on weight, cut back; if he looks too thin, add a little more. You can determine whether your German Shepherd is overweight by using the hands-on test. Place your hands on him, thumbs along the spine and fingers going down the sides. You should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle. If you can see the ribs, he"s too thin. If they"re undetectable beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet.You"ll need to take special care with feeding and exercising a German Shepherd puppy, however. German Shepherds grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet (22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat) that keeps them from growing too fast.And don"t let your German puppy run, jump, or play on hard surfaces like pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. It"s fine for puppies to play on grass, though, and puppy agility, with its inch-high jumps, is okay.Overfeeding your German Shepherd and letting him pack on the pounds can cause joint problems, as well as other health conditions. Limit treats, keep him active, and serve him regular meals rather than leaving food available at all times.For more on feeding your German Shepherd, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The German Shepherd was originally bred to herd flocks in harsh climates, and his medium-length double coat fits the job perfectly, protecting the dog from rain and snow, and resistant to picking up burrs and dirt.The coat types of the German Shepherd are as varied as his color; some German Shepherds are longhaired. However, the ideal German Shepherd has a double coat of medium length. The outer coat is dense with straight hair that lies close to the body, and is sometimes wavy and wiry.The coat comes in variety of colors and patterns including black; black and cream; black and red; black and silver; black and tan; blue; gray; liver; sable; and white. The American Kennel Club doesn"t recognize white as a color for this breed, however, and won"t let white German Shepherds compete in conformation shows, although they"re allowed in other competitions.Sometimes jokingly called "German shedders," the breed sheds year-round, and generally "blows" — sheds a lot of hair at once, like a snowstorm — twice a year. If you want a German Shepherd, be prepared for hair on your black pants, on your white couch, and pretty much all over the house.There"s no magic solution to shedding. Accept it. However, brushing two to three times a week will help more of the hair come out in a brush, rather than on your furnishings. And a sturdy vacuum cleaner doesn"t hurt either.Bathing the dog too often strips the coat of oils that keep it healthy, so start running the bathwater only if your dog really needs it. It shouldn"t be that often; despite his notoriety as a shedder, the German Shepherd tends to be fairly clean and odorless.The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.German Shepherds love to chew, and the habit helps keep their teeth clean. Give them sturdy, safe dental chew toys or bones, and they"ll be fighting tartar buildup as they gnaw, especially on the back molars. Brushing their teeth with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste also helps keep gums and teeth in good shape.
If he"s well trained and has had plenty of exposure to kids, especially as a puppy, a German Shepherd is a great companion for children. In fact, some say he"s a cross between a babysitter and a cop, both gentle with, and protective of, the children in his family.This is a big dog, though, capable of mistakenly bumping a toddler or small child. True to his reserved nature, he"s not tail-wagging friendly with kids he doesn"t know, but he"s generally trustworthy.The German Shepherd can also live peacefully with other dogs and pets, as long as he was taught to do so from puppyhood. Introducing an adult German Shepherd to a household with other pets can be more difficult if the dog isn"t used to getting along with other dogs or cats. You may need to hire a professional trainer to help, or get advice from the rescue organization if that"s where you acquired the adult German Shepherd.
German Shepherds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Shepherds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a German Shepherd rescue.

One of the most versatile sporting breeds around, the stylish and regal German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP for short) is a superb hunting dog who also excels as a family companion. He hunts feathered and furred game and will even trail deer. In the evening, he plays with the kids or curls up next to you on the sofa. Not a hunter? The German Shorthair will be happy to hike or jog with you. Slightly smaller than a Pointer, the GSP has an elegantly chiseled head with dark almond-shaped eyes, an intelligent, good-humored expression, and a large, dark nose. Broad, dropped ears are set high and lie flat against the head. But the most striking aspect of the GSP"s appearance is his short, dense, sleek coat of solid liver or liver and white, which can be patched, ticked or roan. The tail is usually docked, leaving about 40 percent of the original length. This energetic, intelligent dog is enthusiastic at work and play. He likes being with people and is a good friend to children, albeit a bit rambunctious for little ones. That people-loving personality causes the GSP to be unhappy if left alone for long periods, and he can become nervous and destructive if he"s not provided with regular companionship and exercise. He"ll bark at strangers but isn"t aggressive. Males tend to be more outgoing and are more aggressive hunters than females. The muscular GSP needs a great deal of exercise. Expect to give him a workout of an hour or two daily. With his webbed feet and water-resistant coat, he"s a great water dog and loves to swim. If you have a pool, expect him to be in it with you. GSPs like to please their people and will work hard for them, especially if they"re rewarded with praise, play, or food. They typically aren"t stubborn and learn new exercises quickly. The biggest challenge is to keep them focused on training. They can get bored easily. This is one of the few hunting breeds that can perform virtually all gundog roles. The GSP can be a pointer and a retriever. He can hunt upland birds and waterfowl, as well as rabbits, raccoons, and deer. Whatever you ask of your GSP, he will gladly comply with unshakable reliability.
German Shorthaired Pointers are high-energy dogs. At least an hour of intensive exercise, preferably off-leash, each day is recommended. Without sufficient exercise, your GSP may become nervous and destructive. GSPs are people-oriented and don"t like to be left alone for long periods of time without something to keep them busy. Since they are so intelligent, they will find something to keep them busy if you don"t — usually getting into something that you don"t want them to get into. Bored German Shorthaired Pointers can become escape artists, so you need at least a six-foot tall fence if you plan to leave them alone outside. GSPs bark at strangers and noises. They also are a bit reserved with strangers. Female GSPs typically are very protective of their puppies if they have a litter. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Early versions of this type of dog date to the 17th century, but German Shorthaired Pointers as we know them today were created to be multipurpose hunting dogs in the mid- to late nineteenth century. The forerunner to the GSP, the German Pointer or German Bird Dog, was a product of crosses between Spanish Pointers and Bloodhounds, resulting in big houndlike dog with a keen nose. Hunters selected for dogs with biddable personalities, but they came to want style and elegance to go along with that obedient nature and powerful scenting ability. They used Pointers imported from England to add style, and they created a dog that would work as well in water as on land. Prince Albrecht zu Solms-Braunfeld of the Royal House of Hanover was credited with encouraging breeders to select early specimens on the basis of function rather than form. The result was a lean, athletic, and responsive all-around hunting dog who is also an intelligent and affectionate companion dog. The first known German Shorthair in the United States was imported in 1925 by Dr. Charles Thornton of Montana, who began breeding the dogs. Only five years later, the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first German Shorthair registered with the AKC was Greif v.d. Fliegerhalde. World War II affected the breeding of German Shorthaired Pointers. As the end of the war drew near, many breeders hid their gold, their diamonds, their artwork, their Lipizzaner stallions, and their German Shorthaired Pointers. The very best dogs were sent to Yugoslavia for safekeeping. But since Yugoslavia was behind the Iron Curtain after WW II, West German breeders didn"t have access to Germany"s finest GSPs and they were faced with rebuilding their beloved breed from a limited gene pool. Meanwhile, in the U.S., GSPs were progressing by leaps and bounds. The 1950s were a time of significant advancement for the GSP in the United States, but many believe 1968 was the zenith for the German Shorthaired Pointer in the U.S. That was the year that three of the top four finishers at the AKC National Field Trial Championship already had their conformation championships. In addition to their hunting abilities, GSPs have inspired modern-day writers to immortalize the breed in their works. One such writer is Robert B. Parker, whose popular mystery series is about a Boston detective named Spenser. Throughout the series, Spenser has three solid-liver German Shorthair Pointers, all named Pearl. Parker often appears on the dustjackets of his Spenser books with a solid-liver GSP. Rick Bass wrote a book called Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had about living and hunting with a German Shorthair in Montana Sportswriter Mel Wallis wrote a book titled Run, Rainey, Run about his relationship with his intelligent and versatile hunting German Shorthaired Pointer. Today, the German Shorthaired Pointer ranks 19th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males are 23 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 70 pounds. Females are 21 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
Smart, friendly, and willing, the GSP is enthusiastic in everything he does without being nervous or flighty. He doesn"t like being left alone, however, and can develop separation anxiety. This is a house dog, not a yard or kennel dog. He"ll love everyone in the family but may choose a special favorite. He"s highly trainable. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, GSPs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your GSP puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.    
German Shorthairs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all GSPs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In GSPs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. In mild cases, with proper diet and exercise the animal can lead a full and active life. In more severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Your veterinarian can x-ray your dog"s hips for evaluation. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Cancer: This was one of the most reported health problems in a recent survey by the German Shorthaired Pointer Club of America. The types of cancers most often reported were mammary tumors, mast cell tumors, and lymphosarcoma. Lymphedema: A disorder in which valvular blockage of lymph flow or twisted lymphatic ducts cause tissues to swell from an accumulation of fluids. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your German Shorthair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like GSPs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food given might be factors in causing this to happen too. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively, and retches without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.
GSPs aren"t recommended for apartment dwellers. They are best suited to active people who have a home with a large yard surrounded by a high fence. German Shorthaired Pointers were bred to have energy and stamina to last all day in the field, so exercise is important for them. If they don"t get enough exercise, they can become nervous and destructive. Expect to exercise them an hour or more each day. Your GSP will enjoy a strenuous hike, long walk, or a good game of fetch. Given enough exercise, GSPs make excellent house dogs. Because they are so curious and intelligent, it"s a good idea to crate young GSPs when you aren"t around to supervise so they don"t get into mischief. GSPs work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often requires them to work well away from the hunter — they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The GSP who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Shorthair in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your GSP, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The GSP has a short, thick, water-repellent coat that"s slightly longer on the underside of the tail and the back edges of the rear end, known as the haunches. On the head, the hair is softer, thinner, and shorter. The distinctive coat is solid liver or a combination of liver and white. It can be ticked (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), patched, or roaned (a fine mixture of colored hairs with white hairs). For instance, a liver roan GSP has a deep reddish-brown coat lightened by white hairs. The GSP"s smooth, short coat is easy to groom and doesn"t shed excessively. Brush it weekly with a firm bristle brush and bathe only as needed. Rub your GSP"s coat with a towel or chamois to make it gleam. Be sure to check your GSP"s feet after he has been exercising or working in the field. Dry him thoroughly after hunting to prevent a chill. Examine the ears regularly for signs of infection, such as a bad odor, redness, or tenderness. If your GSP scratches frequently at his ears, he may have an infection.
German Shorthairs can do well with children if they"re raised with them. They have lots of energy and make excellent playmates for active older children. They can be too rambunctious for toddlers, however. Adult German Shorthairs who aren"t familiar with children may do best in a home with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. German Shorthairs can get along with other dogs, although some may be aggressive toward members of the same sex. Because they"re hunting dogs, they may also be aggressive toward small furry animals such as cats or rabbits. They can become socialized to them if raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not extend the same courtesies to strange animals who intrude on their property.

A combination of the best features of the Foxhound, Pointer, and Poodle, the German Wirehaired Pointer is a hunter"s best friend: a medium-size dog who can point and retrieve on land and in water, thanks to a wiry, functional coat that protects him from weather extremes and rough underbrush and a keen nose for tracking and pointing. A facial beard gives him a distinctive expression, and a docked tail held horizontally quivers with excitement. Known as the Drahthaar in his homeland of Germany, the breed was developed to be an all around hunting companion, useful for hunting all types of game in all conditions. Because of his heritage as a hunting breed, the German Wirehair requires extensive exercise and he can make an excellent jogging companion. He loves to swim and retrieve, both good ways to provide the level of activity he needs to burn off all that energy. The German Wirehaired Pointer loves having a job to do and thrives on attention. Training him to compete in obedience, tracking, agility, rally, or other dog sports gives him a job, mental stimulation, and exercise. The breed can be slightly independent so it"s important to use a firm, consistent approach and not to back down when he challenges your authority. That said, he doesn"t respond to harsh training methods but does best with motivational, reward-based training. Search and rescue dog handlers have recently discovered this breed and find them to be excellent workers. That"s not surprising since search and rescue combines their love of people and desire for plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. The German Wirehaired Pointer is a versatile dog who excels in the show ring, many physical competitions, and more. He can be your jogging friend early in the morning and sit around the campfire with you at night. If you like a dog who is intelligent, independent, eager to learn, and willing to please with tons of energy to burn, then you may have found the perfect addition to your household.
Can be independent and willful with a tendency to wander if not kept active and challenged Can be suspicious of strangers and aloof with all but his family If left alone too much can develop separation anxiety Can be slow to housetrain They can be aggressive towards other dogs, especially male-to-male aggression. Many have a strong instinct to chase cats and seize cats and other small pets. A bored German Wirehaired Pointer can make a shambles of your home and yard. Young German Wirehaired Pointers (up to about 2 years of age) romp and jump with great vigor, and things and people can go flying. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
German hunters in search of a rugged dog who could hunt any kind of game on any terrain created the German Wirehaired Pointer in the late 1800s. In him they blended the best qualities of the Pointer, Poodle, and Foxhound to develop an all-purpose dog who could point and retrieve on land and in water, no matter what the weather or environment. He is distinguished from the German Shorthaired Pointer not only by his coat but also by his size — slightly larger with a longer body — but also by differences in head shape and temperament. The two breeds were developed separately, with the Shorthair being slightly older and crosses of different breeds were used to develop each. The German Wirehaired Pointer was admitted into the German Kartell for dogs in 1928. He was imported into the United States in the 1920s, and in 1953, the German Drahthaar Club of America was formed. The breed was admitted into the AKC in 1959, when the parent club was officially changed to the German Wirehaired Pointer Club of America. He remains a well-loved hunting companion today.
Males stand 24 to 26 inches at the shoulder. Females are smaller but not under 22 inches. Expect a German Wirehair to weigh 60 to 70 pounds.
Affectionate and loyal to his family, the German Wirehaired Pointer is friendly toward people he knows but aloof with strangers. When raised in a family, he"s devoted to everyone but may have one person who"s a special favorite. More than just a hunting dog, he loves human companionship and makes an excellent house dog and family member as long as he receives plenty of physical and mental exercise. The GWP is a good watchdog, barking when strangers approach his property. He"s possessive of his things and people and may be aggressive toward strange dogs. He will defend his home and family if they"re in danger. Early socialization is a must, as it is with any breed. Trainers will find a sharp "No" more effective than harsh or rough treatment. Respect his intelligence, and you"ll find that he has a strong desire to please.
German Wirehairs are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all German Wirehairs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a German Wirehair. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, which usually affects the lower eyelid on a dog. When present in a dog, it is usually found in both eyes. It causes an impairment of vision and irritates the dog"s eyes. If your German Wirehair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes or that the eyes seem to tear up frequently. Entropion generally occurs before a dog turns a year old but surgery should be held off until the dog reaches adulthood. The treatment is multiple surgeries, in a gradual process so that the dog is not at risk for Ectropion, which is a rolling out of the eyelid. Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results. Von Willebrand"s disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.
The German Wirehaired Pointer was bred to hunt all day in the field and that"s what he"s happiest doing. Short of that, he requires plenty of daily exercise. He can be a mannerly housedog and thrives on human companionship. He can jump with ease, so keep him confined with a fence that"s at least six feet high and can"t be dug under or wriggled through. A covered dog run may be the best way to provide outdoor shelter.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your German Wirehair in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your German Wirehair, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The German Wirehaired Pointer has a functional double coat that protects him from wet and cold conditions as well as rough or heavy underbrush. The coarse, wiry coat is one to two inches long. The hair is straight and harsh and lies flat. In winter the undercoat is dense to provide effective insulation against the cold, but in summer it"s barely visible. The Wirehair"s beard and bushy eyebrows serve as more than decoration. They protect the dog"s face and eyes from scratches and lacerations. Some German Wirehairs are born with a long, soft, silky, or woolly coat. It doesn"t have the same properties as the wire coat and takes considerably more time and effort to care for. The German Wirehair coat comes in various patterns of liver and white: spotted, liver roan (a mix of reddish-brown and white hairs), spotted with roaning and ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), or solid liver, which is described as a deep reddish-brown. The liver-colored head sometimes has a white blaze, but the ears are liver-colored. To match the coat, he has a liver-colored nose, lips, and spotting in the mouth. Genetically, a liver dog can"t have a black spot, and a black dog can"t have a brown nose. If you"re offered a German Wirehair with a black coat or black pigmentation, you may not be getting the real deal. The dense, wiry coat of the German Wirehaired Pointer requires minimal grooming. It should remain clean with regular brushing. The coat sheds lightly year-round. Bathe him only as needed. Thanks to the water-repellent nature of his coat, he dries quickly after a bath or swim. Trim the nails routinely to keep them in good condition and to prevent toenail injuries. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Brush your German Wirehair"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your German Wirehair to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The German Wirehaired Pointer is a great companion for older children who can stand up to his size and energy level, but he may be overwhelming for younger children who are easily knocked down in play. Always supervise any interactions between a dog and children for the safety of both. A German Wirehaired Pointer does better with children when he is raised with them, but an adult Wirehair who"s adopted into a family with children can learn to get along with them if properly introduced and supervised. He may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but if he"s raised with them he gets along fine with other dogs and cats.

The Giant Schnauzer is the largest of the three Schnauzer breeds. He has a commanding appearance and rugged build. But his stoic demeanor is belied by the twinkle in his eyes, hinting at his playful nature. This is a big dog with a big personality. He"s an energetic, intelligent companion who makes life interesting with his independent thinking and playfulness, but dominant personality and bold approach to life. In short, he"s a handful, even for experienced dog owners. Still, in the right home he"s a loyal and courageous companion. There is no limit to the capabilities of a well-trained Giant Schnauzer. Obedience, agility, tracking, carting, and herding are among the dog sports in which you can find him competing. Originally used to drive cattle to market, he excels as a police and guard dog and more recently has branched out to drug detection and search and rescue. He has a gentle and loving side as well, making him an admirable therapy dog. But the Giant Schnauzer"s favorite activity is being with the people he loves. The keys to living successfully with a Giant Schnauzer include training, socialization, and providing physical and mental stimulation. Giant Schnauzers need all of these to become well-mannered dogs, and they need them in abundance. The breed"s intelligence is widely known, and they can be easily trained when their people are firm and consistent. Never let the Giant Schnauzer"s wonderful mind go to waste. Make sure to give him a job; let him find things for you, carry things, perform tricks, and show off his obedience training. Whatever you do, don"t let him become bored. A bored Giant Schnauzer is a destructive Giant Schnauzer. An essential part of preventing boredom is exercise. Expect to provide your Giant Schnauzer with at least an hour of vigorous exercise daily. He"ll enjoy long walks and jogging. Apartments are not the ideal dwelling for the Giant Schnauzer. They do much better if they have a large yard to play in and do their best if they have acreage. They are not outdoor dogs and need to live inside with their family. Giant Schnauzers are among the more dominant breeds and not recommended for homes with young children. In fact, the suggested age range of children is 12 and older. Socialization should begin at a very young age, and it should include exposure to many different people, dogs, and other small pets. Giant Schnauzers tend to be reserved and suspicious of strangers, a trait that makes them excellent guard dogs, but that characteristic must be balanced with socialization to avoid fearfulness or aggression. The Giant Schnauzer has many good qualities and many challenging qualities. It"s important before choosing this breed that you understand the demands he will make upon your life. A Giant Schnauzer is not the fabled gentle giant, but a hard-working, energetic dog who will give back as much as he is given.
Giant Schnauzers are energetic breed and require at least two long walks per day or 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise in the backyard. Without proper exercise and mental stimulation, Giant Schnauzers can become very destructive and difficult to handle. Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for first-time or timid owners. They need a strong leader who can provide clear and consistent rules without resorting to physical force. Although they are a very affectionate breed, the Giant Schnauzer is not recommended for homes with young children because of their size and forceful behavior. Giant Schnauzers will make excellent guard dogs. Apartments are not suitable dwellings for Giant Schnauzers. They need a large fenced yard where they can play and run safely. Socialization is a must with this breed. They can be aggressive toward people, dogs, and other animals they don"t know. They are naturally suspicious of strangers and need to become accustomed to experiencing new people and situations. Giant Schnauzers are companion dogs and should live indoors. They thrive when they are with the people they love. Giant Schnauzers require brushing one to three times a week. Their coats must also be stripped or clippered to remain neat looking. Giant Schnauzers are intelligent dogs who learn quickly and excel at a variety of jobs. Be firm and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Giant Schnauzers will see and take advantage of any inconsistencies in your behavior. Never buy a Giant Schnauzer from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The largest of the three Schnauzer breeds, the Giant Schnauzer was developed in Germany to drive cattle and later to work in butcher shops and stockyards. Some served as guard dogs at breweries. The Giant Schnauzer was probably created by crossing the Standard Schnauzer with larger smoothcoated dogs, rough-haired sheepdogs, and the black Great Dane. The Bouvier des Flandres may also have played a role in his development. He was known as the Munchener and was widespread throughout Bavaria and Wurttemberg. In the early 1900s, Giant Schnauzers were trained for police work in Berlin and other German cities, and it became their primary job. The only reason they didn"t become well known as police dogs in the United States is because the German Shepherds beat them to it. The Giant Schnauzer Club of America was founded in 1962. In the United States, the Giant Schnauzer has remained uncommon. Today, the breed ranks 83rd among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
A male Giant Schnauzer stands 25.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder and weighs 60 to 80 pounds. Females are 23.5 to 25.5 inches and weigh 55 to 75 pounds.
The Giant Schnauzer has the calm, loving temperament of a companion dog and the assertiveness, boldness and energy required of a guard and working dog. He takes his responsibilities seriously and is protective of home and family, willing to defend them with a fierceness that can be intimidating. This is a territorial dog who"s distrustful of strangers, but when he"s not needed as a guardian, he"s a playful and affectionate companion. His intelligence can pose a challenge to the inexperienced trainer, however. Giant Schnauzers require consistent and firm guidance. Without it, they"re quite capable of thinking for themselves and running the household the way they think it ought to be run. As with every dog, Giant Schnauzers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Giant Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Giant Schnauzers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Giant Schnauzers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): is usually found in the elbows but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. This disorder causes a painful stiffing of the joint where the dog will be unable to bend its elbow. It is caused by an improper growth of cartilage in the joints and can be hereditary, caused by trauma or improper diet. It can be detected in dogs as young as five to seven months of age. Although it is a genetic disorder, some research has linked high-protein diets to increasing the severity of this disorder. Autoimmune Thyroiditis: This is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in dogs and is recognized as a heritable condition. The disease tends to become evident at two to five years of age. Dogs may be clinically normal for years, only to become hypothyroid at a later date. Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: This cancer may occur on a toe or toes of dark-haired dogs, including Giant Schnauzers. If your Giant Schnauzer shows signs of lameness for no apparent reason, have your vet take a look at his toes. Removal of the affected toe before the cancer spreads to the chest cavity increases the chance of survival. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Giant Schnauzers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for apartments or condos. They have high energy levels indoors and out, and are best suited to a home with a fenced yard where they can safely run off some of that energy. When they"re not playing outdoors, Giant Schnauzers should be inside with their people, whom they will happily follow around the house. Giant Schnauzers require at least an hour of daily exercise. Plan on a couple of half-hour walks at a good clip or vigorous play. He can be a digger or chewer, so always give him something constructive to do instead. This is a breed that needs a job. Train him to do tricks or help you around the house if you want to forestall destructive behavior. He doesn"t like to be bored, so avoid frequent repetition and turn training into a challenging game to get the best out of him. Train him with firmness and consistency. He can be stubborn and you must be more stubborn. You must be able to provide leadership without resorting to physical force or harsh words. It"s best if you work with a trainer who"s familiar with and understands the breed. Your Giant Schnauzer will respond with enthusiasm to training techniques that are positive and keep him on his toes.
Recommended daily amount: 3 3/8 to 4 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Giant Schnauzer in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Giant Schnauzers can be prone to gastric torsion and should be fed two or three small meals per day to avoid any build up of gas. For more on feeding your Giant Schnauzer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Giant Schnauzer"s outer coat is wiry, hard, and dense, with hairs that stand up from the skin. Beneath it is a soft undercoat. On his face are a harsh beard and eyebrows, the Schnauzer hallmark. The coat is solid black or pepper and salt. The pepper-and-salt coloring is a combination of black and white hairs, and white hairs banded with black. At a short distance, the pepper-and-salt coat appears gray. The Giant Schnauzer"s double coat requires brushing with a stiff bristle or slicker brush about three times a week to prevent mats from forming in the undercoat. Wash his face after every meal. A Standard Schnauzer"s coat usually must be hand-stripped every 4 to 6 months. Hand stripping is necessary if you show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat, but pets can be clippered instead. Be warned, however, that if you clip your Schnauzer"s coat instead of stripping it, eventually the texture will change. It will feel very soft and may shed more. Clippering can also cause a pepper-and-salt coat to look solid silver or solid black, depending on the color of the undercoat. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Giant Schnauzer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Giant Schnauzer jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Giant Schnauzer accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Because of their size, energy level, and commanding nature, Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for homes with young children. The suggested age range is 12 and older who have the maturity to interact appropriately with a large-breed dog. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Giant Schnauzers don"t tend to be buddy-buddy with other dogs, especially those of the same sex, and they probably shouldn"t be trusted alone with cats, no matter how well they seem to get along.
Giant Schnauzers are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you"re interested in adopting an adult Giant Schnauzer who"s already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

This powerful terrier was originally bred to be a tenacious hunter of fox, badger, and rodents, even pursuing his prey underground. Although the modern Glen is more likely to spend his days relaxing with his family, he still has a hunter"s heart. Nothing is more enjoyable to him than a good chase after a pesky squirrel or the neighbor"s cat — other than, perhaps, a good dig. A Glen will happily dig up your flower garden if you let him. You can put his hunter"s smarts to good use with training, so long as you keep it fun for him; otherwise, he"s likely to show his independent streak, and wander off in search of something more interesting. And you can channel his energy and athleticism into dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions. If you"re not interested in dog sports, you"ll need to find another way to help him burn off energy; Glens need daily exercise. And you"ll have to lock up the kibble and keep tempting people food out of reach; this dog has a hearty appetite, and can pack on the pounds very quickly if he"s allowed to overeat. The courageous Glen will defend his family if needed, and his loud warning bark will alert you whenever someone approaches the house, making him an excellent watchdog. But that same scrappy spirit can sometimes get him into trouble with other canines. He"s unlikely to start a fight, but you can be sure he won"t back down from one if challenged. Given enough time to interact with other dogs and practice his canine social skills, however, he can learn to get along with them. It"s not hard to fall in love with the affectionate nature and intelligence of this breed. But before you rush out to buy or adopt a Glen, consider that he has many traits common to terriers: a love of digging, an independent streak, and a inborn tendency to chase cats and other small animals. Whether these qualities make him your dream dog or last on your list, take them into account when considering a Glen.
Glens need daily exercise. Canine sports such as agility are a great way to let them burn off energy, but a brisk 30-minute walk around the neighborhood will do the trick, too. Originally bred to pursue their prey underground, the Glen was designed to dig and still has that drive today. If you want to save your flowerbeds, it"s wise to train your Glen to use a designated digging area in the yard. Glens enjoy playing and roughhousing and can be wonderful companions for children, although they"re strong and rambunctious enough to knock over small or young kids. Although they"re not known to be barkers, the Glen will bark a lot if you accidentally encourage him. Don"t run over to a barking Glen to see what the fuss is about — you"ll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he gets your attention. Teaching the "quiet" command is also helpful. The Glen can be aggressive to other dogs and needs plenty of time with other canines to learn how to get along with them, ideally beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten classes that give the pups time to play with each other, in addition to the obedience training, are an excellent way to help your dog hone his canine social skills. His strong prey instinct makes the Glen a poor fit for homes with other small pets that he may consider prey, such as cats, rabbits, and hamsters. It also means you"ll need to teach him good leash manners, so he doesn"t drag you halfway down the block when he spots something he wants to chase. The Glen was bred to be a hunter of small animals and has a strong inborn drive to chase. If you"ve got a yard, you"ll want a sturdy fence to keep your Glen from taking off after anything that wanders by that looks like prey. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Glen of Imaal Terrier comes from Ireland and takes his name from the remote valley in County Wicklow where he originated. Fans of the Glen believe the breed is descended from dogs brought by settlers — who were awarded land in the valley in exchange for serving in Queen Elizabeth I"s army — who mixed with the local canines. The breed was developed as a multi-purpose hunter, and was used to hunt fox and badger and rid the home of rodents. Because of his tenacious spirit, he was also used in organized dogfights. One of his most interesting jobs was the role of spit dog, in which the dog worked a treadmill-like contraption that powered the rotation of a cooking spit. The Glen was recognized by the Irish Kennel Club in 1933, one of the last of the Irish terriers to gain official recognition in Ireland. The Glen then had to wait 42 years before the British Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975, and another 12 years before the American Kennel Club followed suit, in 1987. The breed is still rare today, although the Glen is gaining popularity every year. He"s proving to be an excellent family dog and, for some owners, he carries on his traditional role as a capable hunting companion.
Males and females stand 12.5 to 14 inches tall, and weigh approximately 35 pounds.
The phrase "large dog in a small body" aptly describes this terrier. He"s brave and feisty and, although he rarely starts a fight with other dogs, he"s most likely to finish it. He will also protect his family if the need arises. He"s intelligent, loyal, and patient, traits that can make for a wonderful companion dog. As a family pet he gives his people plenty of affection, but he"s got an independent streak that"s led many people to label him stubborn.
Glens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Glens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Glens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Glens are also prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative eye disorder involving the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. It causes a gradual loss of vision and eventual blindness. Vets can detect PRA years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. If you"re buying a puppy, look for a reputable breeder who has her dogs" eyes tested and certified on a yearly basis.
The Glen is fairly low-maintenance. He enjoys the company of his human companions, and does best living in the house with them. Training is generally easy with this breed since he"s intelligent and enjoys learning. The key to making training a breeze is to keep it fresh and interesting; do not bore the Glen with repetitive training. When bored, he"ll show his stubborn streak by ignoring you, playing around, or wandering off to sniff his surroundings. The Glen is not an overly noisy breed, but if you accidentally encourage him, he"ll bark and bark and bark. Don"t ever run over to see what the fuss is about when he barks — you"ll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he"ll get the attention of his favorite person. Teaching a "Quiet" command as part of his basic canine manners is a good idea. The Glen needs daily exercise; a brisk, 30-minute walk in the neighborhood will satisfy his need to move. Glens give themselves plenty of exercise too, playing and romping around the house. The breed can be just as happy in an apartment as in a home with a large yard. One word of caution: the Glen, like many other terriers, enjoys — no, loves — digging, and this trait isn"t as easy to deter as barking. You can save your flowerbeds by training your Glen to dig only in one designated spot in your yard.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Glen in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Glen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Glen coat is medium length, with a harsh-textured topcoat and shorter undercoat. The coat comes in several shades of wheaten, from cream to red; any shade of blue, from silver to slate; and brindle, a tiger stripe-like pattern that mixes one dominant color with darker streaks or patches. The Glen is considered to be a non- to low-shedding breed. Grooming the Glen is easy. This isn"t a fussy breed, and there"s no need to make too much fuss over his coat. Brushing once or twice a week keeps the coat from tangling, and a bath every three months or so — or whenever he"s rolled in something smelly — keeps it clean. Glens who compete in the show ring have trimmed coats, but it"s fine to let a family dog go au naturel. Show Glens aren"t trimmed with clippers, like other breeds, but stripped — the coat is thinned and shortened with a sharp, comb-like tool called a stripping knife. Stripping helps Glens maintain the coarse coat that show judges like to see in terriers. Brush your Glen"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Glen enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Glen to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Glen is a great family pet, playful and kind with children. He"s an extremely strong and muscular terrier, though, and can play too rough for very young and small children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. If he"s spent plenty of time around other dogs, especially in puppyhood, the Glen can get along with other canines. He does have a strong personality, however, that can lead to quarrels. And because he was bred to hunt small prey, the Glen isn"t recommended for homes with small furry pets that are allowed to roam free. He"ll chase, and possibly kill, cats, mice, gerbils, hamster, rabbits, and other small animals.
Glens are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and or fostering. Glen of Imaal Terrier Rescue Foundation Glen of Imaal Terrier Club Rescue

The idea was to create a working dog with the sensitivity of the Golden Retriever and the tolerance of the Labrador Retriever. It worked. Cross them, and the result is the unequivocally genial Goldador. Thanks to their easygoing nature and keen intelligence, Goldadors have proven outstanding guide dogs, service dogs, search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs, and bomb detection dogs. But like their parent breeds, Goldadors are happiest simply working alongside a person they love. Goldadors are active and require at least half an hour of daily exercise — most enjoy retrieving games as well as hiking and swimming. Once they"ve reached physical maturity (between 18 and 24 months), Goldadors make excellent jogging companions. Training the eager-to-please Goldador is relatively easy - they come from a long line of dogs who work closely and willingly with people. This makes them an excellent choice for first-time owners, provided they get the exercise, structure, and positive reinforcement they crave. Goldadors are also a good option for families with children (though they can be a bit rambunctious for toddlers), as they want nothing more than to be part of family activities. The ideal residence for a Goldador is a home with a fenced yard, but with regular exercise and companionship they can live and thrive in apartments and condos. Whatever his home, a Goldador should live indoors with his people.
Goldadors like to eat and can easily become overweight if they don"t get enough exercise. Goldadors are good family dogs and generally do well with children of all ages. The Goldador sheds moderately and requires weekly brushing. Goldadors usually get along well with other dogs and pets, especially when they"re raised with them or socialized to them at an early age. Goldadors require about 30 minutes of exercise per day. They enjoy being outdoors and can make excellent jogging companions. Although a house with a fenced yard is the ideal home for a Goldador, he can do well in an apartment or condo with proper exercise. Goldadors can be a good choice for first-time dog owners. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Goldador was first developed more than a decade ago: the Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever were crossed with the hopes of creating a sensitive, tolerant working dog. The effort proved successful. Organizations that train guide and assistance dogs often use these Lab/Golden crosses. As a companion, the Goldador has not yet gained the popularity of some other so-called "designer" dogs, such as Labradoodles. At this time, there are no breed clubs or any efforts to create a breed standard for the Goldador.
The Goldador is one of the few designer breeds with a fairly predictable size, as both parent breeds are large and similar in size and shape. The Goldador is usually 22 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 60 to 80 pounds.
The Goldador is affectionate and loyal, alert enough to make an excellent watchdog, but too friendly to be an effective guard dog. He loves children and gets along with other animals, especially when he"s been raised with them. His intelligence and desire to please render him highly trainable, and he responds best to positive reinforcement techniques. He"s capable of working and thinking independently - and does so beautifully as an assistance dog - but he prefers to have guidance and structure in his life. This is a people-loving dog who won"t be happy left to himself in the backyard. Like every dog, Goldadors need early socialization: exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Goldador puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Goldadors are prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldadors will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this mix. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication and weight loss to control the pain. Cataracts are an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels are regulated in part by insulin, which is produced in the pancreas. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are hungry even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate, but he will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Signs of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and daily insulin injections. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Before purchasing a Goldador, it"s important to research the health concerns that occur with both the Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, heart, and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.
The ideal home for a Goldador is a house with a fenced yard where he can play safely; however, he can do well in an apartment or condo if he gets daily walks or runs. Either way, exercise is very important for a Goldador"s health and happiness — at least 30 minutes per day is ideal. Interested in dog sports? Goldadors make formidable competitors in agility and flyball. Mental stimulation is crucial as well. Teach your Goldador to fetch the paper or your slippers, practice obedience training regularly with him, and put his mind to work from time to time with an interactive dog toy. As with all dogs, positive reinforcement techniques (praise, play, and food rewards) work best with the Goldador. He"s sensitive, and harsh corrections will damage his confidence.
Recommended daily amount: 3.5 to 4.25 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference-the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Goldador, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A Goldador should have the same double coat as a Labrador Retriever, with a short, thick, straight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat (some have a slight wave down the back). Generally, a Goldador"s coat color ranges from yellow to gold to reddish gold, but because the Goldador is a crossbreed, he may inherit the black coat of a Lab parent. Weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush will remove dead hair, helping to keep it off your clothes and furniture. During seasonal shedding periods, however, daily brushing is recommended. Bathe your Goldador as needed, and be sure to give him a thorough freshwater rinse any time he goes swimming. The Goldador can be prone to ear infections, so check and clean the ears weekly. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Goldador"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Goldador jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Goldador to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently - dogs are touchy about their feet - and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Goldadors are an ideal family companion and are generally gentle and loving toward children of all ages. As puppies, they can be a bit rambunctious and may knock over smaller children unintentionally, so close supervision is important. Social and easy-going, Goldadors do well with other dogs and pets, especially when raised together. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.

Golden Retriever Puppies Experience Fall For The First Time It"s no surprise that the Golden Retriever is one of the top ten most popular dogs in the U.S. It"s all good with the Golden: he"s highly intelligent, sociable, beautiful, and loyal. He"s also lively. The Golden is slow to mature and retains the silly, playful personality of a puppy until three to four years of age, which can be both delightful and annoying. Many keep their puppyish traits into old age. Originally bred for the physically demanding job of retrieving ducks and other fowl for hunters, the Golden needs daily exercise: a walk or jog, free time in the yard, a run at the beach or lake (Goldens love water), or a game of fetch. And like other intelligent breeds who were bred to work, they need to have a job to do, such as retrieving the paper, waking up family members, or competing in dog sports. A tired Golden is a well-behaved Golden. As well as giving your Golden Retriever physical and mental exercise, you should also be prepared to include him in your family activities. The Golden Retriever is a family dog, and he needs to be with his "pack." Don"t consider getting a Golden unless you"re willing to have him in the house with you, underfoot, every day. There"s one other potential drawback to the breed: He"s definitely not a watchdog. He might bark when strangers come around, but don"t count on it. Most likely, he"ll wag his tail and flash that characteristic Golden smile.
Golden Retrievers shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Daily brushing will get some of the loose hair out of the coat, keeping it from settling on your clothing and all over your house. But if you live with a Golden, you"ll have to get used to dog hair. Golden Retrievers are family dogs; they need to live indoors with their human "pack," and shouldn"t spend hours alone in the backyard. Golden Retrievers are active dogs who need 40-60 minutes of hard exercise daily. They thrive on obedience training, agility classes, and other canine activities, which are a great way to give your dog physical and mental exercise. Although they"re gentle and trustworthy with kids, Golden Retrievers are boisterous, large dogs that can accidentally knock over a small child. Goldens love to eat, and will quickly become overweight if overfed. Limit treats, measure out your dog"s daily kibble, and feed him in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. Because the Golden Retriever is so popular, there are many people breeding Goldens who care more about making money out of the demand for puppies than in breeding happy, healthy dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
For many years, there was a legend that Golden Retrievers were descended from Russian sheepdogs bought from a circus. In fact, the breed was developed in Scotland, at the highland estate of Sir Dudley Majoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth. Tweedmouth, like many gentry of his day, bred animals of all kinds, trying to perfect different breeds. Tweedmouth"s breeding records from 1835 to 1890 show what he was aiming for with the Golden: A talented retriever — Tweedmouth was an ardent waterfowl hunter — with a superb nose, who would be more attentive to his human hunting companion than the setters and spaniels used at the time for retrieving. He also wanted the dog to be loyal and even-tempered in the home. Tweedmouth took Nous home to Scotland, and in 1868 and 1871, bred him to Belle, a Tweed Water Spaniel. Tweed Water Spaniels (now extinct) were known for being eager retrievers in the hunting field, and exceptionally calm and loyal in the home — characteristics you"ll find in today"s Golden Retrievers. Nousand Belle"s descendants were bred with Wavy- and Flat-coated retrievers, another Tweed Water Spaniel, and a red setter. Tweedmouth kept mostly the yellow puppies to continue his breeding program, and gave others away to friends and relatives. Not surprisingly, Tweedmouth"s breed first attracted attention for their skills in the hunting field. One of the most well-known was Don of Gerwyn, a liver-coated descendent of one of Tweedmouth"s dogs, who won the International Gundog League trial in 1904. The Kennel Club in England officially recognized the Golden Retriever as a distinct breed in 1911. At that time, they were classified as "Retriever — Yellow or Golden." In 1920, the breed name was officially changed to Golden Retriever. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1932. Today, the Golden Retriever is the second most popular breed in the U.S.
Males are 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 65 to 75 pounds. Females are generally 21.5 to 22.5 inches tall and 55 to 65 pounds. Golden Retrievers usually reach their full height by one year of age, and their mature weight by two.
A sweet, calm nature is the hallmark of the breed. The Golden was bred to work with people, and is eager to please his owner. Though hard-wired with a good disposition, like all dogs the Golden must be well-raised and well-trained to make the most of his heritage. Like every dog, the Golden needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Golden puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Goldens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Goldens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle (out-flow) and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Allergies: Golden Retrievers can be allergic to a variety of substances, ranging from food to pollen. If your Golden is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, have him checked by your vet. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes periodic seizures and convulsions. Your vet will need to know how severe the seizures are and how often they occur to determine what medication to prescribe, if any. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that"s thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Hemangiosarcoma: This is a very dangerous form of cancer that originates in the lining of blood vessels and spleen. It most commonly occurs in middle-age and elderly dogs. Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that"s common in large and giant breeds.
Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog, your Golden will be happy to join you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard, they"d be more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens love to retrieve. Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog mellow when he"s back inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems. Like other retriever breeds, Goldens are naturally "mouthy," and they"re happiest when they have something to carry in their mouths: a ball, soft toy, newspaper, or best of all, a smelly sock. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Don"t let your Golden puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Golden in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. For more on feeding your Golden, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Golden Retrievers have a dense, water-repellent outer coat with a thick undercoat. Some coats are wavy, some are straight. The fur feathers on the back of the front legs and underbody, with heavier feathering on the chest, back of the thighs, and tail. Golden Retrievers come in all shades of gold, from light to dark gold. Some breeders have begun selling "rare white Goldens," but the American Kennel Club does not recognize white as a coat color for the breed. Golden Retrievers shed moderately in the winter and summer, and heavily in the spring and fall. If you live with a Golden, you"ll need to adapt to a certain amount of dog hair in your house and on your clothes. The Golden"s thick coat means lots of grooming. Daily brushing is recommended to prevent tangling, and once a week is the bare minimum. Your Golden will also need a bath at least once a month, often more frequently, to keep him looking and smelling clean. Brush your Golden"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Fold-over ears create a warm, dark environment for bacteria or fungus to grow in, and breeds that have them — such as the Golden — are prone to ear infections. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. Check them every time he gets wet, too. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Golden to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.  
The amiable Golden Retriever isn"t bothered by the noise and commotion of kids — in fact, he thrives on it. He"s a large, strong dog, though, and he can easily knock over a small child by mistake. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Golden"s attitude toward other pets is the more the merrier. He enjoys the companionship of other dogs, and with proper introductions and training, can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.

Also known as the Groodle, the Goldendoodle ranges in size from small to large, depending on the variant of Poodle that the Golden Retriever is crossed with. Originally bred as a larger alternative to the already popular designer breed known as the Cockapoo, the Goldendoodle has proven to be an excellent family dog. They"re also versatile working dogs. Goldendoodles have achieved success as guide dogs, service dogs, therapy dogs, and sniffer dogs (one study tested their success at sniffing out peanuts in foods for owners with nut allergies). Goldendoodles have also done well in agility. The Goldendoodle is an affectionate and gentle dog that has gained popularity since he was first developed in 1990s. He"s still a young cross compared to other designer breeds, and many of today"s litters are the results of first-generation breedings between Poodles and Golden Retrievers. Goldendoodles are usually highly social and get along well with everyone. They don"t do well in any type of guarding or watchdog role and should not be used in that capacity. They can thrive in both city and country settings, but they"re not well suited to apartment living, since they do better with the space provided by a fenced yard. Goldendoodles should not live outside or in a kennel, however, since they thrive when they are in contact with the people they love. Goldendoodles can be very easy to train and are a good match for first-time or timid owners. They"re not known to have any aggressive traits, but they do need proper socialization to avoid any shyness or fearfulness. Goldendoodles also need daily contact with their owners; they"ll suffer from separation anxiety if they"re left for too long. The best way to avoid any destructive behavior is to crate them and to provide toys and treats to keep them busy throughout the day. Keeping the radio on when you"re out is another great way to keep them happy. Goldendoodles are considered to be non- to light shedders and may be a good match for people with allergies. They do require weekly or biweekly brushing, and many owners opt to have them clipped. Although Goldendoodles are a young designer breed, that hasn"t stopped people from understanding their worth. They have become popular quickly, and their star is still rising. They make excellent family dogs and provide gentle, intelligent companionship throughout their lifetimes.
Designer dogs, also called hybrids, aren"t true breeds — they"re crosses of two specific breeds. If you"re interested in a Goldendoodle puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren"t as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don"t know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog. The Goldendoodle is the result of Poodle to Golden Retriever breedings. So far there are very few multigenerational breedings (crosses between two Goldendoodles). The Goldendoodle is considered to be a non- to light shedder, but he requires regular grooming and clipping. If the coat is kept short, it should be clipped every six to eight weeks and brushed every few weeks. If the coat is kept in its natural state, it should be brushed once every week or two. The Goldendoodle is not a watch dog, and he"s generally not known to be noisy. He may not bark even if someone knocks on the door. Although he"s got an average energy level, the Goldendoodle is not recommended for apartments. He does much better in a home with a fenced yard. The Goldendoodle requires about 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise. Being a wonderful family companion, the Goldendoodle generally gets along well with children and does well with other dogs and family pets. The Goldendoodle is a very social dog who should not live away from his family. He"s are not suited to living in a kennel or outside; he wants to be in the house. The Goldendoodle can suffer from separation anxiety if left for long periods at a time. The Goldendoodle may make an excellent companion to people with allergies. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Goldendoodle is considered to be one of the newest of the "Doodle," or Poodle mix, breeds. Breeding began in the 1990s, after both the Cockapoo and the Labradoodle gained footholds. The theory behind the Goldendoodle"s development was to create a larger Doodle that maintained the desired low-dander, low-shedding coat and that possessed the intelligent and friendly nature of the Golden Retriever. The fact that the Goldendoodle is still a fairly young cross means that most pups are the result of first-generation breeding. That is, most are Golden Retriever and Poodle mixes; as of yet, breeding rarely occurs between pairs of Goldendoodles. Despite the fact that the Goldendoodle has gained some popularity, especially in Australia, there is still no breed club or registry in existence. There are, however, several online communities for the Goldendoodle lover and owner. The Goldendoodle"s popularity is still on the rise, and many believe that it will surpass that of other Doodle breeds.
Goldendoodles vary in size. This is because, at this stage, they"re rarely the result of multigenerational breedings (in which one Goldendoodle is crossed with another), and there are no breed standards that Goldendoodle breeders are aiming for. However, the Goldendoodle tends to come in three different sizes: Miniature, Small Standard, and Large Standard. The Miniature Goldendoodle is the result of a Miniature or Toy Poodle crossed with a Golden Retriever. These dogs tend to range in size from 13 to 20 inches in height and 15 to 35 pounds in weight. The average height for a Small Standard Goldendoodle is 17 to 20 inches; the weight is 40 to 50 pounds. The Large Standard Goldendoodle averages 20 to 24 inches in height and weighs 50 to 90 pounds.
The Goldendoodle has not become popular for lack of good reason. His positive personality traits are numerous — he endears himself to everyone he meets with his friendly, intelligent, accepting nature. Usually highly affectionate, he"s gentle and patient and makes a wonderful family companion, especially since he actively enjoys human company. He is loyal and, with proper training, can be highly obedient. He does have a playful side and can be mischievous if the mood hits. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Goldendoodle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Goldendoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Goldendoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldendoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Goldendoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Ear Infections: These can be a problem for Goldendoodles because of their floppy ears, which trap moisture. Check and clean the ears regularly. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition (though it"s also sometimes triggered by malnutrition) in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this condition is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Goldendoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as large Goldendoodles. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.
The Goldendoodle can be easy to train. Intelligent, he"s usually eager to please — a perfect combination for either first-time trainers or experienced trainers. He should be trained with positive reinforcement, since harsh corrections could damage his confidence. Socialization is important for all breeds, but for a gentle dog like the Goldendoodle it can be instrumental in discouraging any shyness or timidity. The Goldendoodle has an average energy level and will require daily exercise through walks or a good romp in the back yard. Generally speaking, 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise will be enough to keep a Goldendoodle from becoming bored. He"s known for his love of water, so swimming provides another opportunity for appropriate exercise. Since the Goldendoodle may grow large, he does require room to move. He"s not recommended for apartments but should have a home with some type of fenced yard. He"s not an ideal pet for outdoor or kennel living, since he thrives when he"s with his family, so owners should expect to keep him primarily in the house. The Goldendoodle can also suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behavior, if he"s left alone for long periods at a time.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 4 cups (depending on adult size) of high-quality dry food a day, divided into multiple meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Goldendoodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. A Goldendoodle should also be fed several small meals per day instead of one large one, since the Golden Retriever can suffer from gastric torsion, or bloat, a trait that can be easily passed on to any Goldendoodle offspring. For more on feeding your Goldendoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Goldendoodle should have a wavy to curly coat of about two to three inches in length. He has longer hair on the tail, body, ears, and legs (legs may be slightly feathered); the hair on the head and muzzle tends to be shorter. The coat can be black, copper, white, cream, gray, golden, apricot, or red, although golden seems to be the common coat color. White can often be found on the feathering, and the Goldendoodle"s coat tends to lighten with age. Although he"s considered a non- to light shedder, the Goldendoodle still requires some grooming to keep his coat in the best shape possible. Owners generally opt to clip the coat for easier maintenance; but if you choose to leave it in its natural state, expect to brush it about once every week or two. If he"s clipped, he"ll still need a good brushing every few weeks. The Goldendoodle requires a bath only when it"s absolutely necessary, or his coat and skin will lose necessary oils and moisture. Brush your Goldendoodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Goldendoodle to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Goldendoodle makes a wonderful family pet, especially if his nature takes after the Golden Retriever parent. He"s likely to be highly patient and gentle and to get along well with children of all ages. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He does well in homes with other dogs and pets and doesn"t actively show aggression toward other animals. Of course, as with all dogs, it"s important to properly socialize your Goldendoodle from puppyhood.

"Brains, beauty, and bird sense" is a phrase often applied to the Gordon Setter. If you"ve ever had the privilege of seeing the breed in the field, you understand why. In art, he"s often depicted as scouring the moors for a pheasant or other bird, and in life he does the same, pretty as a picture with his long, soft, straight black and tan coat, feathered tail, and noble, dignified stance. The Gordon is the largest of all Setters. He"s an active, well-muscled dog capable of working but who would also remain a puppy for his entire life if he could. Gordons are known for maturing late and tend to remain young at heart. The breed is intelligent, gentle, and loyal. Gordons need daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can expend their energy. The Gordon is not a backyard dog by any means, however, and should not live away from his family. He"s prone to separation anxiety and can become destructive when left alone for long periods. Gordon Setters need a firm hand when it comes to training but not so firm that their sensitive spirit is damaged. Consistent, firm, fair training using the techniques of positive reinforcement will prevent them from becoming dominant, wilful and stubborn. The mental activity provided by training will help keep them occupied and out of trouble. Some Gordons can be aggressive toward other dogs, but it"s not a common trait in the breed, and they should never be vicious. Toward strangers Gordons can be aloof, preferring the attention of their own people. They"ll tolerate attention from strangers but don"t actively seek it. To avoid any aggression or fear regarding strangers, it"s important to socialize your Gordon Setter — expose him to a variety of people, sights, sounds, and situations — in puppyhood. A properly socialized Gordon is alert and fearless, an excellent watchdog. The Gordon Setter is a loving companion and steady protector of the children in his life. Gordons are generally patient with children and tolerate much of their teasing and treatment, although of course they shouldn"t have to. It"s always important to supervise interactions between children and dogs. Known for their vocal skills, Gordons can be verbal in conveying their likes, dislikes, and other feelings. When they"re provided with the attention and exercise they crave, they"re loving, protective, and intensely devoted to their families.
Adult Gordon Setters require one to two hours of daily exercise. This can be a game of fetch in a field or backyard, a run, or a couple of long walks. Gordon Setters do well with children and may be protective of the children in their family. In general, they make wonderful, caring companions for children and their whole family. It is important to remember that dogs and small children should never be left unsupervised, regardless of breed. Being an intelligent, hardworking breed, the Gordon Setter can become destructive if his needs for exercise and mental stimulation are not met. Boredom and extra energy are not a great mix to have, and the best way to avoid any destructiveness is through proper exercise and training. Gordon Setters are not backyard dogs. They are much happier when they are with their families and should not live away from them. They enjoy personal attention and family activities. Gordon Setters are generally rambunctious when they are young but usually become gentle and calm as they get older. Strong temperaments are well known in the breed and many owners have the feeling that they are "owned" and not owner. Gordons are independent and determined, qualities that can translate to stubbornness to some. Gordon Setters make excellent watchdogs and are wary of strangers. They may seem aloof to some but are loving toward their own family. Barking is not uncommon in the breed, and Gordons will bark to express their likes, dislikes, and other emotions, including whether they think you should have taken them with you when you left. Gordon Setters can suffer from separation anxiety and may become destructive when they do. Gordon Setters shed, and their coat requires more than minimal grooming. If you do not have the time needed to properly groom them, this may not be the breed for you. Although many Gordon Setters get along well with other animals, some may be aggressive toward other dogs. Socialization is important for all dogs and should be started as possible. Gordon Setters are not recommended for apartment living. Although they are generally quiet indoors, they need a large fenced yard to exercise in. They love to run so a fenced yard is a must. Although Gordon Setters are known for their stubbornness, they can be sensitive and easily cowed with abuse and neglect. Never treat your dog harshly but instead give him firm, fair, consistent training without the use of anger or physical force. If Gordon Setters aren"t trained they may become destructive, wilful, and dominant. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Black and tan setting dogs were known in Scotland as early as 1620, but it was their presence in the kennels of the fourth Duke of Gordon 200 years later that brought them to prominence. The Castle Gordon Setters had first-class hunting skills and were beautiful as well. It was written of them: "They are not fast dogs, but they have good staying powers and can keep on steadily from morning until night. Their noses are first class and they seldom make a false point. When they stand, you may be sure there are birds." The early Gordons also came in black and white, tricolor, and red, but the Duke was said to favor the dogs with black and tan coloring, and that"s what has prevailed over the years. When the Duke died in 1827, his heir, the Duke of Richmond, carried on his kennels. Between 1859 and 1874, England"s Kennel Club listed 126 Black and Tan setters in its studbook. In June of 1859, at the first official dog show, a Black and Tan Setter by the name of Dandie, took first prize for setters, who could trace his pedigree back to the kennels of the Duke of Gordon. The breed officially took the name Gordon Setter in 1924. The first Gordon Setters imported into the United States came from the kennel at Gordon Castle. The dogs, Rake and Rachel, were purchased by Daniel Webster and George Blunt in 1842. They were the foundation of the breed in the United States. The American Kennel Club recognized the Gordon Setter in 1892, and the Gordon Setter Club of America, Inc., was formed in 1924. The club is still in existence today and boasts a membership of more than 1,000. Today the Gordon Setter ranks 88th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The Gordon Setter male stands 24 to 27 inches and weighs 55 to 80 pounds; females are 23 to 26 inches and 45 to 70 pounds.
The loyal Gordon Setter is intensely devoted to his family but wary of strangers, characteristics that make him an excellent watchdog. He"s mannerly and eager to please, but like any dog he"ll take advantage of lax leadership and can become dominant, wilfull, and stubborn if not provided with firm, fair, consistent training. A Gordon Setter expert once wrote of the breed that if he acts sorry for a misdeed, he"s probably more sorry that he got caught than that he misbehaved. In the field or in any competitive situation, he"s alert, fearless, intelligent, and capable. He"s a personal hunting dog, in the sense that he works nearby rather than ranging far afield. Gordons aren"t fast, but they have a lot of stamina. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Gordon Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Gordon Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. It"s not unusual for a Gordon puppy to go through a fear period sometime between 6 and 9 months of age. Without coddling him, maintain a calm demeanor so you can reassure him that whatever situation has spooked him is normal and nothing to be afraid of.
Gordons are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Gordons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re buying or living with a Gordon. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Gastric Dilatation Volvulus (Bloat): Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
Gordon Setters need daily strenuous exercise, so they"re good companions for joggers or runners. A good game of fetch in the backyard or a long walk will also contribute to their physical well being. Puppies are rambunctious and full of the devil. Let them play all they want in the backyard, but limit forced exercise such as road running or obedience jumps to avoid placing unnecessary strain on the still developing bones and joints. Avoid these types of workouts until the dog is 2 years old and introduce them gradually. Gordon Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force. Housetraining is fairly easy with most Gordon Setters, although there are exceptions to every rule. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. Crate training not only aids in housetraining, it also keeps the puppy from chewing (a common habit of Gordon puppies) and provides a safe and quiet place for the dog to rest. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Gordon puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he"s 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it"s important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break. The silver lining to the Gordon"s wild puppyhood is his quiet and sedate adulthood. He loves competition, however, and can excel in many dog sports. The Gordon can be a busy breed, but once you understand his drive and meet his needs, he can be a wonderful companion who"s just as happy to lie beside you as he is hiking or hunting beside you.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Gordon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Gordon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Gordon Setter"s attractive coat is soft and shiny, ranging from straight to slightly wavy. He has long hair on the ears, chest, belly, the back of the legs, and the tail. The tail is short, with feathering that grows in a triangular shape, becoming uniformly shorter toward the end of the tail. He wears a classic black and tan coat, with the tan markings being a rich chestnut or mahogany on the sides and bottom of the muzzle, over the eyes, on the throat, two large spots on the chest, on the inside of the hind legs (although not so much that the black is eliminated), on the forelegs, and around the vent (the anal opening). The black and tan colors are clearly defined, never mixed together. A Gordon may have a white spot on the chest, the smaller the better. Brush and comb your Gordon two or three times weekly to prevent mats and tangles. Trim the hair on the bottom of his feet and between the toes to prevent it from picking up debris in the summer and forming ice balls in winter. Brushing will go a long way toward keep your Gordon"s coat clean and shiny, but you can bathe him every one or two weeks if you want without drying out the coat. Just be sure to use a shampoo and conditioner formulated for dogs and rinse thoroughly. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Gordon"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Gordon may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Gordon"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Gordon enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Gordon to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Gordons are fond of and protective toward children. They"ll put up with a lot, and when they"ve had enough teasing or roughhousing, they"ll walk away. They may be a bit much for toddlers, though, being large enough to accidentally knock them down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Gordons get along with other dogs and cats if they"re raised with them, but they might not be so friendly toward strange dogs.

The Great Dane was originally bred to hunt wild boar, but he probably wouldn"t be very good at it today. The ferociousness necessary to track down such a large, wily animal was eventually bred out of the Great Dane. He"s now a gentle soul who generally gets along well with other dogs, animals, and humans. However, his size and his power bark will scare the wits out of a burglar. Anyone who owns one of these dogs eventually understands that while you may be used to his awesome size, others usually need a little time to get there. The Great Dane was developed from Mastiff-type dogs, but he"s more refined than other descendents of this ancient breed. A Great Dane is sleek and elegant. He has an athletic, muscular body. His massive head — and massive is the right word — is long and narrow. He"s got a long, graceful neck. His ears can be cropped or left natural. (Cropped ears are common in the U.S., but in other countries, ear-cropping is banned.) His size can present problems. Eyeballing a dog who weighs what you do makes some folks nervous. His tail can knock over a lot of things, particularly in a small space. And given the opportunity, he"s an impressive counter surfer. Luckily, he isn"t rambunctious or highly energetic. Size notwithstanding, a Great Dane is a sweet, affectionate companion. He loves to play and is gentle with children. He has a peaceful disposition, although he hasn"t lost any of the courageousness that helped him hunt wild boar. Although he isn"t particularly vocal (despite his killer power bark), he wouldn"t hesitate to defend his family. Even given his inherent gentleness, it"s advisable to teach him good manners and attend obedience training classes when he"s young. His sheer size alone could make him impossible to control when he"s an adult, and — as with any dog — you never know when he might see something he just has to chase. He"s eager to please and highly people-oriented, demanding a great deal of attention from those around him. He tends to nudge people with that big old head of his when he wants to be petted. Sometimes you"ll meet one with lapdog tendencies who see no reason not to hop onto the sofa and drape themselves on you. Surprisingly, the Great Dane typically doesn"t eat as much food as you"d think. And while he needs daily exercise, he doesn"t need a huge yard to play in (although he certainly would enjoy one). Because of his beauty and gentle nature, more and more people are discovering the Great Dane. He currently ranks as the 24th most popular dog breed, according to registrations with the American Kennel Club. Just be aware that because of his size, he"s got a relatively short life span of around eight years old. That means he takes up a huge space in your heart for a short amount of time.
The Great Dane is sweet, eager to please, people-oriented, easy to housetrain, and he responds well to training using positive reinforcement. Like many giant dogs, Great Danes are short-lived. Great Danes require a lot of space. Even though they make great housedogs, they need a lot of room just to move around. There"s little that they can"t reach (kitchen counters and dinner tables are no problem), and their tails can easily sweep your coffee table clean. Everything costs more when you have a big dog — collars, veterinary care, heartworm preventive, food. In addition, you"ll need both a crate and a vehicle that are large enough to hold your Great Dane without crumpling him into a pretzel. And let"s face it, you"ll scoop up a lot of poop. It takes a while for the bones and joints of large dogs such as Great Danes to stop growing and become stable. Don"t allow your Great Dane puppy to jump, and don"t take him jogging until he"s at least 18 months old; this will reduce stress on the growing bones and joints. The Dane"s special giant-breed dietary requirements have to be followed, or else orthopedic issues can develop. Great Danes aren"t particularly suited to apartments or small houses, simply because they"re so big. They"re not jumpers, fortunately, so a six-foot fence will contain them. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Drawings of dogs who look like Great Danes have been found on Egyptian artifacts dating back to 3000 B.C. and in Babylonian temples that were built around 2000 B.C. There"s evidence that similar dogs originated in Tibet, with written reports of such dogs appearing in Chinese literature in 1121 B.C. The breed is thought to have been taken into various parts of the world by the Assyrians, who traded their dogs to the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks and Romans then bred these dogs with other breeds. Ancestors of the English Mastiff were probably involved in the breed development, and some folks believe that the Irish Wolfhound or Irish Greyhound also may have played a role. Great Danes originally were called Boar Hounds, because boars were what they were bred to hunt. Their ears were cropped to prevent boar tusks from tearing them. In the 16th century, the name of the breed was changed to "English Dogges." Late in the 1600s, however, many German nobles began keeping the largest and most handsome of their dogs in their homes, calling them Kammerhunde (Chamber Dogs). These dogs were pampered and wore gilded collars lined with velvet. Talk about a sweet life. The name Great Dane arose in the 1700s, when a French naturalist traveled to Denmark and saw a version of the Boar Hound who was slimmer and more like a Greyhound in appearance. He called this dog Grand Danois, which eventually became Great Danish Dog, with the more massive examples of the breed called Danish Mastiffs. The name stuck, even though Denmark did not develop the breed. Most breed historians give credit to German breeders for refining the breed to be the well-balanced, elegant dog we love today. In 1880, breeders and judges held a meeting in Berlin and agreed that since the dogs they were breeding were distinctly different from the English Mastiff, they would give it its own name — Deutsche Dogge (German Dog). They founded the Deutscher Doggen-Klub of Germany, and many other European countries took up the name as well. The Italians and English-speaking countries didn"t accept this name, however. (Even today, the Italians call the breed Alano, meaning Mastiff; and in English-speaking countries, of course, they"re called Great Danes.) Throughout the late 1800s, wealthy German breeders continued to refine the breed. They turned their attention to the dog"s temperament, because Great Danes had aggressive, ferocious temperaments due to the fact that they were originally bred to hunt wild boar, a particularly ferocious beast. These breeders tried to produce more gentle animals, and — luckily for us today — they succeeded. We don"t know when the first Great Danes were brought to the U.S., or even where they came from, but the Great Dane Club of America was formed in 1889. It was the fourth breed club allowed to join the American Kennel Club.
Male Great Danes are 30 to 34 inches tall and weigh 120 to 200 pounds. Females are 28 to 32 inches tall and weigh 100 to 130 pounds.
A well-bred Dane is one of the best-natured dogs around. He"s a gentle, sweet, affectionate pet who loves to play and is relaxed with children. He has a great desire to please, which makes him easy to train. The Great Dane wants to be where the family is. He likes people a lot, including strangers and children, and will welcome visitors happily, unless he thinks you need defending. Then he can be fiercely protective. Some Danes wish they were (or truly believe they are) lapdogs, and they"ll keep trying to get there even if you and your lap mysteriously keep moving. Good-natured as they are, Great Danes definitely need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Dane puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Great Danes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Danes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. Development Issues: Growing problems can develop in puppies and young adults. These are sometimes associated with an improper diet — often a diet too high in protein, calcium, or supplements. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Great Danes. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Bone Cancer: Sometimes known as osteosarcoma, this is the most common bone tumor found in dogs. It"s usually seen in middle-aged or elderly dogs, but larger breeds such as the Great Dane tend to develop tumors at younger ages. Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign is lameness, but the dog will need X-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs. Heart Disease: Heart diseases affect Great Danes; varieties include dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve defects, tricuspid valve dysplasia, subaortic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent right aortic arch. Prognosis and treatment vary depending on the specific disorder and the dog"s age and general health. Surgery: Surgical issues are a bit different for Great Danes than for smaller dogs. For any needed surgery, find a surgeon who is experienced with giant-breed dogs. Ask for a presurgical blood test and ask them to include a clotting profile (this is not part of typical presurgical blood work). In Great Danes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Despite his giant size, a Great Dane is mellow enough to be a good housedog, though he"s not well suited to a tiny apartment because he"ll knock into everything. He can get cold in the winter, so he shouldn"t be left outside in colder climates — but then no dog should. In fact, he would enjoy having a sweater or fleece coat to keep him toasty warm when you go for a walk in a winter climate. He"s relatively quiet indoors, but he needs a long walk at least once a day, or a large yard to play in. An adult Great Dane needs 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, depending on his age and activity level. Puppies and adolescents need about 90 minutes of exercise a day. If you plan on keeping him in a yard occasionally, he"ll need a six-foot fence, though he"s not a jumper. If you"re a gardening fan understand that he really enjoys destroying the landscaping (just a little safety tip in hopes of preventing human heart attacks). While you may want a running partner, wait to take your Great Dane jogging until he"s at least 18 months old. Before then his bones are still growing, and they"re just not up to the task. In fact, he may not be ready to go jogging until he"s two. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Great Dane doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate (a really big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Dane accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Dane in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Great Danes are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Diet is important for a rapidly growing giant-breed puppy like a Great Dane, more so than for most breeds. A Great Dane puppy should never eat regular puppy food because it"s too rich for him; he needs the puppy food designed for large breeds. It"s best not to supplement with anything, especially not with calcium. Assuming a high-quality food, the amount to give your Great Dane varies greatly with age and gender. However, generalized daily amounts are: Three to six months: females, 3 to 6 cups; males, 4 to 8 cups Eight months to one year: females, 5 to 8 cups; males, 6 to 10 cups Adolescents: females, 8 cups; males, 9 to 15 cups Adults: females, 6 to 8 cups; males 8 to 10 cups Until the age of four to five months, a Great Dane puppy should have three meals per day. After that, give him two meals per day for life. He should never have only one meal per day. For more on feeding your Great Dane, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The six usual colors of Great Danes" smooth, short coats are: Fawn (a golden color with a black mask) Brindle (fawn and black intermixed all over the body in a tiger-stripe pattern) Blue (steel blue, which is really a sort of gray) Black Harlequin (white with irregular black patches over the entire body) Mantle (black and white with a solid black blanket over the body) He sheds a lot, but his coat is easy to keep in top condition with regular brushing. Use a firm bristle brush and shampoo as needed. Regular brushing keeps your Great Dane"s coat healthy and clean, and cuts down on the number of baths he needs. As you might imagine, bathing a Great Dane is a daunting task, particularly if he"s not looking forward to it. Hard to imagine him hiding under the kitchen table while trying to escape a bath, but it happens. Brush your Dane"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin getting your Dane used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Great Dane loves children and is gentle with them, especially when raised with them from puppyhood. Keep in mind he doesn"t have any idea how big he is compared to a small child, and so can accidentally knock them over quite easily. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child not to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. Generally speaking, a Great Dane will get along with other pets in the household, but occasionally some can be aggressive with livestock, or they just may not care for the other pets. It"s an individual taste: some won"t tolerate another animal in the house, while others will snooze with the cats and other dogs.
Great Danes are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Danes in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a great Dane rescue.

The Great Pyrenees was originally developed to guard flocks alongside shepherds. These days he usually works with people, often in therapy and rescue work. This is a dog who loves the sport of carting. The Great Pyrenees is an intelligent dog who is used to working on his own and figuring things out for himself. This can be a wonderful trait, but having a mind of his own can also create some training challenges. And you have to train this dog. If not, he will become completely uncontrollable — and at his full size of up to 160 pounds, you don"t want that. Since training takes lots of consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement, the Great Pyrenees is not suitable for an owner who"s reluctant to put in the necessary team. He"s worth the work, though. Calm inside the house, he somehow manages not to get underfoot, and has an amazing ability to determine friend from foe. A Pyr is courageous and devoted to his family, protecting those he loves with his life if needed. Many folks feel safer with a Great Pyrenees in their home, but it"s worth reemphasizing that he"s a dog who requires lots of socialization, starting as early as possible. If he doesn"t receive it, he can become aggressive or fearful, and he may not allow nonfamily members into your yard without (or even with) your permission. That may sound kind of cool until you stop receiving mail and your friends refuse to come over. When brought up right, he"s a social guy, and he likes to be active and to play with other dogs of any breed. He loves children, and it"s best to give him as much exposure to them as you can. Once he"s trained, you can take him to nursing homes as his size is perfect for those confined to wheelchairs. He loves going for rides in the car, but make sure the air-conditioner is on high. He"s a big fan of cool weather. Everyone who lives with a Pyr should have a set of ear plugs. He barks a lot, because that"s his job. He"ll vocalize — loudly — to ward off pesky intruders, and he"s got a broad definition of intruders. He will bark even more at night because of his extraordinary senses of sight and sound, which enable him to detect coyotes, deer, wolves, raccoons, bear, and possum (all of which must be protected against). His vocal styling will definitely scare them away and keep the family and property safe. A Pyr"s hearing is so sensitive he can detect intruders even with all the windows closed in the house; the air-conditioner, TV, and dehumidifier running on high; and the iPod playing AC/DC at full blast. He really can hear that well, and he"ll definitely let you know all about what he hears. He"ll let you know his emotions, too. Almost all Pyrs use a paw to let their people know how much they are loved. He"ll paw on your shoulder while you"re driving, on your lap while you"re eating, on your leg when a yummy treat is near (even a not-so-yummy treat). He has double dewclaws — not one dewclaw like most dogs, but two that are near each other. Don"t even think of removing them, because he uses them to climb (part of your protection services). Keep the double dews trimmed, as they can easily get caught on fences and tear easily. He"ll make himself at home on any type of furniture, including couches, beds, and chairs, even if there"s no chance he"ll fit. Never mind that detail; he"ll squeeze himself in one way or the other, even if it seems physically impossible. A Great Pyr will remind you that his comfort should be of the utmost importance to you. Who the heck do you think king-size beds are made for? The Great Pyrenees is a wonderful breed who is affectionate and gentle, hardworking and independent. He can be a devoted family companion or a conscientious career dog. His pride is evident in the regal way he carries himself. Make no mistake — he has a job to do, and he loves to do it.
The Great Pyrenees is okay in apartments because he"s mellow. But homes with large yards are better. If you want a dog you can walk off leash, this may not be the dog for you because of his independent thinking and wandering tendencies. Expect some shedding on a constant basis and at least one major shedding period per year. On the up side, the Great Pyr only requires about 30 minutes of brushing a week. A Pyr can be difficult to train because of his ability to think on his own. He"s not a good match for new or timid dog owners, because he needs consistency and a strong owner who will socialize him and train with positive reinforcement. He"s a wonderful watchdog for the family, but he needs socialization to keep from becoming shy or aggressive to both dogs and people. He thrives with his family and should live inside the house. He can become bored and destructive when separated from his family or left to live out in the backyard. A Great Pyrenees is generally loving and gentle with younger creatures, so he"s a wonderful dog for families with children. He"s a hard-core barker and is not recommended for homes where his barking can disturb others. Great Pyrenees do best in cooler climates, but don"t clip his hair during hot weather. His coat insulates him and keeps him cool, so when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun. He needs exercise, but not as much as you"d think — 20 to 30 minutes a day is fine. He has a double dewclaw that should not be removed but should be kept trimmed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The sheep-guarding Great Pyrenees originated in the Pyrenees Mountains, which form a natural border between France and Spain. He"s known by different names: Great Pyrenees in the United States and Canada, the Pyrenean Mountain Dog in the United Kingdom and most of Europe. His ancestry is believed to date back ten to eleven thousand years to dogs who originated in Asia Minor. His ancestors are thought to have come to the Pyrenees Mountains sometime around 3000 B.C. There the breed was developed to create a dog who would aid shepherds. At first, the Great Pyrenees was considered to be a dog owned by peasants. But in 1675, the Dauphin in the court of King Louis XIV declared that the Great Pyrenees was the Royal Dog of France. This prompted the French nobility to acquire Great Pyrenees and use them to guard estates. The first Great Pyrenees to be imported to North America went to Newfoundland, Canada. There the breed is attributed with creating the Landseer Newfoundlands, after crossbreedings between the Great Pyrenees and the Newfoundland. Throughout the 1800s, the breed gained popularity throughout England, Europe, and the United States. He was introduced into the St. Bernard"s breeding program in Switzerland in an effort to reestablish the numbers of dogs at the famous hospice where the St. Bernard originated. In the Pyr"s homeland, however, the breed began to deteriorate due to unscrupulous breeding practices. The two World Wars took a toll on all dog breeding; luckily several Great Pyrenees were imported to the United States before the European continent was effectively closed due to World War II. After the war, breeders began efforts to restore the breed to its former glory, and today the Great Pyrenees is a much-loved and admired dog.
The Great Pyrenees is a giant dog (both in size and heart). The average height is between 27 to 32 inches for a male and 25 to 29 inches for a female. On average, Great Pyrenees should be between 100 to 160 pounds for a male and 85 to 115 pounds for a female.
A calm, gentle, docile demeanor is the norm for a Great Pyr. Shyness, aggressiveness, and nervousness are not acceptable whatsoever, but do your part by providing tons of socialization when he"s a puppy. With training, he"s well mannered. He is gentle and can be somewhat serious. Courageous and devoted to his people, he"s the best friend anyone could ask for; he"s also a warm blanket and a comforting soul in the night. He loves being a therapy dog. He is intelligent, used to working on his own and figuring out things by himself, which means he"s an independent thinker and can be stubborn. He manages to be a good guard dog while also being friendly, calm, and gentle. Like every dog, the Great Pyr needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Pyr puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Not all Great Pyrs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Bone Care: Large-breed bones require special consideration. Treat your Great Pyr like an antique until he"s about 18 months old. His bones grow so fast that he can have growing pains, which is uncomfortable. He doesn"t fill out until he"s three or four years old. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs but can occur in large dogs as well. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Addison"s Disease: This is a serious disease also known as hypoadrenocorticism. It"s caused when the adrenal gland does not produce enough adrenal hormones, which affects the salt and potassium levels in the body. Early signs of Addison"s disease include lethargy, vomiting, and poor appetite. A severe sign can be heart arrhythmia. Treatment consists of fludrocortisone acetate or corticosteroids, and salting food. Aggressive treatments include intravenous medication. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Entropion: Entropion, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Great Pyr has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically. Anesthesia Sensitivity: This can affect dogs with a low metabolism, like the Great Pyrenees. Remind your vet of that sensitivity prior to surgery. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Great Pyrs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
A good fence around your yard is absolutely necessary, and it should be at least four feet but preferably five or six feet high. This dog is used to roaming the Pyrenees Mountains while protecting his flocks, and he needs territory. If you don"t have a fence to corral him, he"ll keep running to grasp territory. He"s a Houdini Hound who can scale fences. And if snow drifts to the height of the fence, he"ll walk right over it, so get out that shovel and move the piles away if you don"t want him visiting the neighbors during a snowstorm. (They could be surprised — it"s a bit difficult to see him approaching in the snow.) There"s a reason the Pyr rescue groups won"t adopt a Pyr to anyone without a fence, or who thinks they can just yard-train him; it"s simply not going to happen. He must have training from the time he"s a small pup, but despite his size he needs gentle, positive reinforcement. He is scarily intuitive, has impeccable manners, and a memory like an elephant: he will never, ever forget anything, which is why you always need to use a kind, gentle approach in training. Negative training makes a Pyr shy, timid, and fearful, which is problematic in any dog, much less a dog of this size. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Pyr doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate (a big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Pyr accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Pyr in a crate all day long, however. He shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Great Pyrenees are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Great Pyrenees need roughly 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day to keep him in his best condition. That"s not a lot for a dog this size. He adores cool or cold weather and loves to go for long hikes as long as it"s not hot (or even warm). He"s a big, hardy dog who can carry backpacks and gear, but don"t let him do that in the summer because he needs to be kept cool. The Great Pyrenees is an intelligent breed and can become bored a bit too easily. Provide proper stimulation with toys to prevent any destructive behavior. He enjoys being with his family and can cause household ruin if left alone for long periods. Training a Great Pyrenees can be difficult, but it can also be easy if you start early and maintain kindness and consistency. Originally bred for guarding livestock, the Pyr is used to working and thinking on his own. This trait is still strong, whether he comes from a line of pet dogs or working dogs. He needs you to establish the rules as soon as he comes into your home. If you don"t want a 100-pound dog on your couch, then the cute 20-pound fluff ball shouldn"t be allowed on the couch either. Patience is the key to training him, but remember that even after basic training you"ll never have a dog who can roam off-lead, since he will wander regardless of your cries and commands. Socialization is a must for a Great Pyr. He is bred to guard, and if he"s not properly socialized he can become aggressive or fearful. Expose your puppy to a variety of situations, including puppy classes, after he"s been properly vaccinated. Also keep him in the house with you"re the family. A dog who is left tied up outside will become aggressive, even to his owners. Leash training is also important, especially considering that your Great Pyrenees will eventually use up to 160 pounds of weight to pull you where he wants to go. Don"t let him off-leash as he will, without a doubt, roam. Leash-training will start in puppy kindergarten, and the techniques you learn there should be practiced regularly. After your Great Pyrenees has reached a level of training that you"re happy with, you can take him to many different kinds of training events and competitions, especially those that are done on-leash.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Great Pyrenees in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Great Pyr, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Great Pyrenees are considered to be average to heavy shedders, depending on the climate they live in, so expect to have white hairs on your clothes, furniture, car, and toothbrush. Despite the shedding, he"s fairly easy to groom and only requires about 30 minutes of work per week. If his silk-like hair gets dirty, it dries quickly and combs right out. Granted, he leaves white, silky dust bunnies on your floor, but if you collect it and put it outside, birds will use it for their nests — it"s a good insulator for their newborn babies. The Great Pyrenees has a double coat, the top coat and the undercoat. The top coat is long and thick and should be coarse in texture. It may be straight or slightly wavy, but it shouldn"t be curly. There should be a mane or ruff around the neck, more pronounced in males; and feathering on the back of the legs, forming a pantaloon on the back thighs. The tail should have a plume and the face and ears should have short, fine hair. The undercoat should be dense and woolly. He is white or white with markings that can be badger, tan, gray, or reddish-brown in color. The markings can appear on the head, as a mask, on the ears, on the tail, and (occasionally) on the body — but markings should never cover more than one-third of the body. The undercoat can be either shaded or white. Don"t clip the Pyr"s hair during hot weather. The coat keeps him cool, and when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun. Other than brushing, the Great Pyrenees coat requires very little care. Generally the eyebrows, whiskers, ears, hocks, feet, and forelegs are trimmed, although that"s usually for dogs showing in conformation. Baths can be infrequent (once every couple of months) since his coat tends to shed dirt. When you do bathe your Great Pyrenees, use a high-quality dog shampoo to avoid stripping oils from the dog"s coat and skin. Check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Pyr may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Pyr"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails regularly if he doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your arms from getting scratched when your Great Pyrenees enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Pyr to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Pyr loves children and is absolutely devoted to them. He"ll protect them with his life, and he is in fact tender toward everything that is small and weak. Young children can"t manage such a large dog on a leash, however, so he should be walked by an adult or an older child. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Great Pyr generally does well with other animals in the house, especially if he"s been raised with them from puppyhood. A well-socialized Pyr tends to get along with other dogs.

The handsome, alert, and powerful Greater Swiss Mountain Dog — or Swissy, as his fans call him — is relatively unknown outside of a group of dedicated enthusiasts. But if you own one of these large, striking dogs, be prepared to turn plenty of heads. Owners of the breed are often asked, "What kind of dog is that?" Topping out at well over 100 pounds, the Swissy"s size, paired with his deep, loud bark make him a good watchdog. But he"s a gentle fellow at heart, devoted to his family and loving with kids. Although he needs room to stretch his legs — this isn"t an apartment dog — he needs only a moderate amount of exercise. Originally bred to herd cattle, pull carts, and serve as a watchdog, the modern Swissy likes to have jobs to do. He excels in obedience, agility, and conformation competitions, and does well in drafting, weight pulling, herding, pack hiking, and versatility. The Swissy has also served as a therapy dog and search and rescue dog. Since he"s so large when fully grown, it"s important to start early with obedience training and socialization — teaching the dog to be friendly with other dogs and people. And be prepared for a long puppyhood: the Swissy is slow to mature, both physically and mentally, and can stay puppyish until he"s three years old. While the Swissy isn"t the right breed for everyone, those who are willing to love, train, and care for this large dog will enjoy wonderful companionship.
Due to his large size, the Swissy is not suited for apartment or condo living. A home with a fenced yard is ideal. The Swissy was bred to work and likes to have a job to do. Obedience training can give him the mental stimulation he needs, and is essential for handling a dog of this size. Although he"s generally good with kids, the Swissy is a large dog who can accidentally knock over a small child. The Swissy is prone to overheating. Keep him inside in air conditioning or in front of fans when the weather"s hot, and wait until it cools off to exercise him. Some Swiss Mountain Dogs will chase small animals. To keep the neighbor"s cat safe — as well as your dog — make sure the yard is securely fenced, and keep him on leash when you"re out and about. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is considered one of Switzerland"s oldest dog breeds. There are several theories as to the Swissy"s origins. The most popular is that he"s descended from large, Mastiff-like dogs that were brought to the Alps by invading Roman Legions. The Swissy"s ancestors served as herding, guard, and draft dogs. At one time the Swissy is thought to have been one of the most popular breeds in Switzerland. By the 1900s however, their numbers dwindled, probably because their traditional jobs on Swiss farms were taken over by other dog breeds or machines. In 1908, a canine researcher named Albert Heim spotted two dogs at a Swiss Kennel Club jubilee, listed as "short-haired Bernese Mountain Dogs." Heim recognized the dogs as being large members of the Sennenhund type, a family of four breeds that includes the Swissy. Heim lobbied to get the dogs recognized as a separate breed and, in 1909, the Swiss Kennel Club listed the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund) in the Swiss Stud Book. Since then, the breed"s popularity has grown slowly, but steadily. In 1968 the first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were brought to the U.S., and soon after, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America formed. The Swissy was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995, as a member of the Working Group.
Males stand 25.5 to 28.5 inches tall and weigh 105 to 140 pounds. Females stand 23.5 to 27 inches tall and weigh 85 to 110 pounds.
The Swissy"s personality is gentle, alert, and fun loving. These aren"t easygoing, pushover dogs, however; they"re confident canines with their own ideas, and they can be stubborn at times. Because of their bold personality, Swissy dogs do best with owners who can be kind, yet confident, leaders. This breed is alert and observant, always on the lookout for something amiss. That, plus his loud bark to alert you when he spies something out of the ordinary, makes him a good watchdog, though he"s typically not aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Swissy needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Swissy puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Swissy dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Swissy dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Swissy dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as the Swissy. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Splenic Torsion: This condition occurs when the spleen rotates, causing it to expand and become engorged with blood. The symptoms are not always obvious, but can include vomiting, fever, pale gums, and tenderness. Splenic torsion requires immediate veterinarian care and the surgical removal of the spleen is necessary. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Distichiasis: This is a condition in which extra eyelashes (cilia) grow from the glands of the upper or lower eyelid. A hair follicle develops deep within the glands rather than on the skin surface. As the hair grows, it follows the duct of the gland and exits from the gland opening along the smooth surface of the eyelid margin. In many cases, these eyelashes rub on the cornea, causing irritation and tearing, and occasionally corneal abrasions. Entropion: Entropion is an inward rolling of the eyelid. It usually affects the lower eyelid of both eyes, causing irritation and vision loss. It generally occurs before a dog turns a year old; surgery to correct the problem is usually held off until the dog reaches adulthood. Panosteitis: Commonly called Pano, this condition causes self-limiting lameness. At about five to 12 months of age, the dog may limp on one leg, then another, then it stops. There are usually no long-term effects. Rest and restricted activity may be necessary for a while if the dog"s in pain. Swissy Lick: This mysterious affliction causes the dog to start franticly licking or swallowing anything in sight. The cause is unknown, although it appears to be related to severe gastrointestinal pain. It"s treated with gas and acid-reducing medications. Swissy lick is more common among young dogs, but seniors can get it as well.
The Swissy is not suited to apartment or condo life. Because he"s a large, working dog, he needs room to roam — a home with a large, securely fenced yard is ideal. You won"t need to sign up for a marathon, though; he needs just a moderate amount of exercise. With his Swiss heritage, this breed is a natural fit for cold climates, and he loves to romp in the snow. The flips side is that he"s prone to heatstroke. Don"t let him exercise strenuously when it"s hot; during hot spells, limit your outings to cool early mornings or evenings. During the heat of the day, keep him inside with fans or air conditioning. If he has to be outside, make sure he has shade and, of course, plenty of water. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Swissy puppy. Like many large breeds, the Swissy grows rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. Keep your Swissy pup on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast. Don"t let him run and play on hard surfaces such a pavement, do a lot of jumping, or pull weights until he is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes. Like all dogs, the Swissy needs to be socialized — taught to be friendly to other dogs and people — beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten and obedience classes are a great way to socialize your Swissy and teach him good canine manners. Now, as for housetraining: while every dog is different, Swissy fans say that the breed generally takes to housetraining slowly. The reason isn"t exactly clear. But if you use crates and stick to a good housetraining routine, your Swissy will grasp the general concept of housetraining within a week or two of arriving at his new home. But don"t count on him to be completely reliable in the house until many months later.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Large-breed puppies such as the Swissy need slow, sustained growth to help prevent orthopedic problems, such as hip dysplasia. Raise them on a diet designed for large-breed dogs or food for adult dogs. Whatever diet you choose shouldn"t overemphasize protein, fat, and calorie levels: 22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat is recommended. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Swissy in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Swissy, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Swissy has a dense outer coat, about one to two inches in length, and a thick undercoat. The breed sheds minimally most of the time, with the exception of twice-yearly "blow-outs," when the undercoat comes out. The color is distinct, with a black outer coat and rust and white markings on the face and body. Grooming a Swissy isn"t terribly complicated — the short coat is easy to care for and the breed is naturally clean. Brushing once or twice a week, plus a bath as needed (usually every month or so) with a mild dog shampoo is enough to keep the Swissy looking sharp. Brush your Swissy"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Swissy to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Swissy enjoys the attention and company of youngsters if he"s given plenty of exposure to them beginning in puppyhood, and the kids are taught to treat the dog with care and respect. However, young children should never be left unsupervised with any dog. Even if the Swissy means well, this is a large, strong dog, and a Swissy can easily knock over a small child by accident. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The good-natured Swissy generally enjoys the company of other dogs and loves to play rough and rambunctious. This is especially true if he has been properly socialized with other dogs at an early age. As in any breed, dogs of the same sex who haven"t been spayed or neutered may not tolerate each another. Swissy dogs vary in their prey drive: some will chase squirrels, cats, and other small animals, and some won"t. As with any dog, you"ll have a better shot at peace among the family pets if you expose your Swissy to other animals beginning at an early age, and are careful about the introductions.
The Swissy is often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Swissy dogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Swissy rescue.

Whether or not you"ve seen one in the flesh, you know what a Greyhound looks like. The iconic hound with the aerodynamic build epitomizes speed with his narrow head, long legs, and muscular rear end. We"ve all seen images of this sprinter, if only through seeing it plastered on the side of a bus, but many of us don"t truly know the breed. One of the most ancient of breeds, Greyhounds probably originated in Egypt and have been prized throughout history. Historic figures who were captivated by this breed include Cleopatra, Queen Elizabeth I of England, and General Custer, who raced his dogs the day before he set off on his fateful trip to Little Big Horn. The patronage of the two queens led to Greyhound racing being dubbed the "Sport of Queens." Aside from its royal fans, there"s a lot to love about the breed. The Greyhound combines a stately appearance with a friendly attitude toward people and other dogs. Loyal and affectionate with his family, he"s not aggressive toward strangers, although he will let you know — through a bark or a subtle pricking of his small, folded ears — that someone"s approaching your home. Greyhounds have a reputation for high energy levels, but in reality their favorite pastime is sleeping. Designed as sprinters, not distance runners, they"ll be satisfied with a daily walk, although active people find they make good jogging or running partners. In fact, Greyhounds do fine in apartments or homes with small yards--although they need a solid fence to keep them from chasing animals they might see as prey, such as squirrels, rabbits, or trespassing cats. Regardless of their strong prey drive, there"s no doubt that this is a wonderful breed that deserves many belly rubs. Whether you bought your Greyhound from a show breeder or adopted him from the racetrack, you"ll find yourself regarding this breed with the same respect that others have given it throughout its long and glorious history.
Although a Greyhound puppy is an adorable addition to your family, many sweet adult Greyhounds are available for adoption after their racing days are over. Every year, many "retired" racing Greyhounds are abandoned, euthanized, or sold to laboratories, but they can adapt wonderfully to home life and give you many years of companionship. Before you put your name on a waiting list for a Greyhound puppy, check out the world of Greyhound rescue. Because of their thin coats, Greyhounds can get the shivers. If you live in a cold climate, buy a warm coat for your dog to wear in snow or rain. A Greyhound should never be allowed to run off leash except in a securely fenced area. Greyhounds have a strong prey drive and will take off after a rabbit or squirrel before you even see it. When Greyhounds aren"t socialized — exposed to many different people, places, and situations — they can become timid and have problems adapting to changes in schedule or environment. Take the time to socialize your dog or puppy. Greyhounds are generally a loving breed and affectionate to their people. Usually this friendliness extends to strangers, but they can be aloof with some or all strangers. Although many believe that this breed is made to run and has the destructive energy to go with it, that couldn"t be further from the truth. Greyhounds are generally docile and quiet, and they"re world-class nappers. They do well in apartments and homes with small yards because of their low indoor energy. Muzzling Greyhounds, especially retired racing Greyhounds, is a common practice. Greyhounds will nip at other dogs and can hurt smaller dogs and animals if their prey drive takes over. Many rescues recommend muzzling adopted Greyhounds, at least until they get settled into their new homes and you have a better idea of their temperament. Greyhounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog, and they require minimal grooming. The lack of a heavy coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears, and nicks. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Greyhound is an ancient breed that originated in the Middle East and North Africa and has won the admiration of many different cultures. Greyhounds have been mentioned by Greeks, depicted in art by Egyptians, praised by a Roman poet, and are the only breed of dog mentioned in the Bible. Greyhounds found their way into Europe during the Dark Ages. They were so respected for their hunting prowess that the laws of the time protected royal game reserves by forbidding anyone living within 10 miles of the king"s forests from owning a Greyhound. The Greyhound"s popularity continued to grow in England, thanks to the popularity of coursing (the sport of chasing prey) and racing. Spanish explorers and British colonists brought them to the Americas where they thrived as well, coursing jackrabbits and coyotes on the wide-open plains. The Greyhound was one of the first breeds to appear in American dog shows, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The first official coursing race took place in 1886, and the National Coursing Association in the United States was founded in 1906. Greyhound racing took off and is popular today in many states, although it"s a controversial sport because so many dogs are abandoned, euthenized, or sold to laboratories if they don"t do well at the track.
The Greyhound is a sleek, athletic dog. There are two types, which vary somewhat in size: Racing Greyhounds are usually 25 to 29 inches tall, and show Greyhounds are slightly larger, at 26 to 30 inches in height. In both types, males typically weigh 65 to 85 pounds, females 50 to 65 pounds, with racing dogs tending toward the lower end of the scale.
Greyhounds generally have a wonderful temperament, being friendly and non-aggressive, although some can be aloof toward strangers. Give them a treat, though, and they"re likely to become a friend for life. They"re intelligent and independent, even catlike in many ways. They do have a sensitive side and are quick to react to tensions in the home. They can become shy or timid with mistreatment, even if it"s unintentional. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Greyhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Greyhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Greyhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Greyhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Greyhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Greyhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs. A normal dose for any other dog of his size can kill a Greyhound, probably because of the breed"s low percentage of body fat. Choose a veterinarian who"s aware of this sensitivity and knows how to dose your Greyhound. If you can"t find a vet who"s knowledgeable about sighthounds, be sure to alert any vet who treats your dog to this sensitivity. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism involves low levels of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily thyroid medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog that"s getting daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated promptly. Usually the twist must be repaired surgically.
Greyhounds are fairly low energy dogs, but they still need and enjoy a daily walk. If they aren"t exercised regularly, they can become bored, which may lead to destructive behavior. Greyhound have an inborn drive to chase prey, and owners need a solid fence to keep their dogs from taking off after small animals. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended with this breed, as their desire to chase is far stronger than any fear of a temporary shock. Greyhounds should also be kept on leash during walks. That strong prey drive will have them ignoring commands if something interesting catches their eye. And with their speed, they can easily outdistance a distraught owner and become lost. Greyhounds can become overweight, which is bad for their health. It"s common for a retired racing Greyhound to gain roughly 5 pounds after retirement, but he shouldn"t be allowed to gain any more than that. Because he"s tall, provide him with raised feeding dishes to make dining more comfortable. Training your Greyhound, whether adopted as an adult or bought as a puppy, should begin as soon as he"s home. Greyhounds can have a stubborn streak and often approach training with a "what do I get out of it?" mentality. They"re independent and need a confident, consistent owner. However, they also have a sensitive side, which makes harsh training the worst fit for the breed. They do better with patience, consistency, and training methods that use rewards rather than punishment — they like food rewards best. Greyhounds sometimes have difficulty with the sit command as it"s not a natural position for them, and you will often see them sort of balancing on their tail. Greyhounds need to be exposed to many different people, places, and situations — a process that trainers call socialization — to prevent them from becoming timid or fearful. Many obedience schools offer socialization classes, which are also a wonderful start to obedience basics. Other ways to socialize your Greyhound include visits to dog-friendly public places and stores, walks in the neighborhood, and inviting people to your home. Introduce new social situations gradually. Greyhounds are generally easy to housetrain. Retired racing greyhounds are especially amenable to crate training and will do well as long as you keep them on a regular potty schedule.
Recommended daily amount: Males, 2.5 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; females, 1.5 to 3 cups. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Greyhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Greyhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Greyhounds have a short, smooth coat that"s easy to care for. Despite their name, they can be any color, including fawn, black, red, blue, gray, or white. They can also be various shades of brindle, a striped pattern that gives them the look of having just streaked across the African savanna, or white with at least one other color, known as particolor. Despite their short coat, Greyhounds shed. Brush them daily to keep shedding at a manageable level. Your Greyhound will love being massaged with a rubber curry brush, also known as a hound mitt. Use a dry dog shampoo when you bathe him to keep his coat clean and smelling great. Keep ears clean and free of debris with a moist cotton ball. Never insert anything into the ear canal; just clean around the outer ear. This breed"s teeth need the most dedicated care. Greyhounds tend to have poor dental health, so regular brushing is a must if you want them to have sweet breath and no ugly tartar buildup. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Greyhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Greyhounds can be patient with children and have been known to step delicately around toddlers, but they do best in homes with older children who know how to act around dogs. They"re more likely to walk away from a teasing child than to snap at him. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Although Greyhounds do very well with other dogs, they can view smaller dogs, cats, or other small pets as prey, especially if the animals run from them. Some have a much lower prey drive than others, but it"s always best to supervise your Greyhound around smaller animals. Instinct can overcome training, and Greyhounds have been known to injure or even kill smaller pets. And even if they"re best friends with your indoor cat, they may view outdoor cats that come onto their property as fair game.
Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Greyhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Greyhound rescue.

Harriers sometimes are described as "Beagles on steroids." These lively, active scent hounds were originally bred to hunt hares and foxes in large packs, but they also are wonderful family companions. Don"t expect to find one in your neighborhood, however. They are one of the rarest breeds registered with the American Kennel Club. In 1994, for example, there were only four Harrier litters born in the entire United States (resulting in only 31 puppies). Built to work, Harriers have lots of bone and substance for their size. Their muzzles are long with a well-developed nose and open nostrils. Their eyes are dark, alert, and intelligent. Speed is not as important as stamina for these dogs. Hares and foxes have been known to drop from exhaustion after being pursued by a relentless pack of Harriers. Harriers have long, dropped ears, and their feet have thick pads that enable them to run for hours through rough terrain. They have broad chests to provide lots of room for their hearts and lungs. Their tails are set high and carried upright (not curled over their backs), making it easier for hunters to see them from a distance or in thick brush. Harriers have a playful, outgoing personality. They are not quite as outgoing as the Beagle, but they definitely love to be around people and other animals. They generally are sweet-tempered and tolerant of children. You should watch them, however, around pets that aren"t dogs. Because they are pack dogs, they generally get along well with other dogs, but may see cats, hamsters, and other non-canine pets as prey. They like to live in a pack, whether the pack is made up of other dogs or people. You should always keep in mind that your Harrier is an active dog who likes to explore and track. Some like to bay (a loud, prolonged bark). You should have a well-secured fence your dog can"t jump over or crawl under, and when you take your Harrier to unsecured areas, such as a park, be sure to keep him on leash. Otherwise, he may take off, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit. Also, remember that Harriers were bred to have a lot of energy and stamina, as well as to think for themselves. They are independent and tireless hunters. These traits, while good for hunting, may present difficulties in training. You"ll need to provide them with enough exercise to keep them from becoming bored and destructive. These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn"t mean getting into mischief! Because they are independent thinkers who can sometimes be stubborn, you should strongly consider obedience training for your Harrier. Because these dogs have great stamina and are energetic without being hyperactive, they do well in performance sports such as agility and rally. They also make great jogging, bicycling, and hiking companions. Although they are relatively inactive in the house, they are not recommended for apartment dwellers unless you are willing to provide them with a great deal of outside exercise every day. Harriers make good watchdogs because they will alert you to any strange noises or visitors to your home. However, don"t expect them to be guard dogs. They are so friendly that they often greet strangers as though they were old friends. Although they are sweet, even-tempered dogs, Harriers are not recommended for first-time dog owners because of their training and exercise needs.
Some Harriers can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. Harriers tend to be vocal and some love to howl. Some Harriers like to dig and have been known to dig under fences to escape and chase after something. Harriers are hunting dogs and will take any opportunity to pursue game or follow a scent. A secure fence is a necessity if you have a Harrier. Underground electronic fences are not effective with Harriers because they have a high pain threshold and the brief shock they get from crossing the invisible line does not deter them from chasing or investigating things beyond its boundaries. Harriers are high-energy dogs and have a great deal of stamina. They are perfect for active families or athletic people who like to jog or bicycle with their dogs alongside (on leash so they don"t take off on a chase), but they may become obese or destructive if living in a more sedentary home. If not properly trained and socialized, your Harrier may see cats and other small furry animals as prey and act accordingly. Harriers are good watchdogs who will bark if they feel that someone or something is threatening their territory, but they are not good guard dogs. After raising the alarm, they are likely to greet strangers as long-lost friends. Harriers can stay outdoors if given adequate shelter from the heat and cold, but being pack animals, they are at their best when they are around other dogs or their family. The Harrier"s long ears prevent adequate air circulation to their ears and they may be prone to ear infections. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
There are several conflicting stories about how the Harrier breed came to be. The word Harrier was Norman French and meant hound or dog. With that connection, the best guess may be that the earliest Harrier-type dogs descended from a cross of Bloodhounds, Talbot hounds, and perhaps even Basset Hounds, all of which had their origins in what are now France and Belgium. In England, where the Harrier breed was developed, a pack of Harrier-type dogs was established as early as 1260 — more than 800 years ago! The Penistone pack, established by Sir Elias Midhope, existed for at least 500 years, well into the 18th century. Originally, these packs were used to hunt hare with the hunters following on foot, so at that time, they were a much slower and more methodical type of hound than today"s Harriers. When foxhunting became fashionable with the hunters on horses, Harriers were adapted to have more speed. The Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed in England in March 1891. At that time, Harriers were much more popular than Beagles. The 1891-1900 volumes of the AMHB"s Stud Book list 107 registered packs of Harriers. Admission into the Stud Book in those days was based on the records of the pack owner or by committee. It appears that many of the foundation Harriers were in fact small Foxhounds. Additionally the names of some of these foundation Harriers appear in the pedigrees of top-winning Beagles. From this, it"s surmised that the name "Harrier" was used to describe the type of hunting and size of the hound rather than its pedigree. Interestingly, although Harriers are recognized by the American Kennel Club, the Canadian Kennel Club, and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (the world canine club), as well as others, England"s Kennel Club hasn"t recognized the Harrier breed since 1971. The last time Harriers were shown at a Kennel Club show or entered in their Stud Book was in 1915. The reason for this could be that in England, Harriers are only owned by hunting organizations and are registered with the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles. They usually are registered with the AMHB only if they are a member of a pack and have been used for at least one hunting season. There are reports of Harriers being imported to the U.S. as early as the 1700s. Several packs of Harriers were established and some were recognized by the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America. At least two American packs were listed in the AMHB in England. Although they are great family companions, Harriers have never been a popular breed. From 1884 to 1994, only 949 Harriers have been registered with the American Kennel Club. Although they"ve always ranked at or near the bottom of the list in popularity, 182 Harriers have become AKC Champions of Record, which is a very high percentage of champions to dogs registered. Despite their lack of popularity, they have been a part of the American Kennel Club since its beginnings, being the 13th breed recognized by the AKC, and the 4th Hound breed recognized. Two Harriers from Baltimore, Maryland, were entered at the first Westminster Kennel Club Show in 1877. Four Harriers from New York were entered in the second Westminster show. Registrations of Harriers were few and far between in the early 1900s. In 1936, a dog named Monarch became the first Harrier Champion of Record and also the first Harrier to win Best in Show. Monarch was owned by the Monmouth County Hunt, and bred from dogs imported from England. There were several Harrier packs in the US through the early years of the 20th Century. George S. Patton, who was at the time a Colonel, was Master of the Cobbler Harriers from 1936 to 1938. From 1940 to 1958, no Harriers were registered with the AKC, although some were registered with the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America. As in England, most Harriers in the U.S. have historically belonged to hunting packs and aren"t registered with the AKC. A few Harriers started being shown in AKC shows in the early 1960s. In 1965, Breezewood Chop Chop became the second AKC Champion after a gap of 30 years. In 1969, a Harrier named Naabeehos Harvey won Best in Show at Superstition KC, and earned 5 points towards his championship. In 1970, Lady Elizabeth of Byron Mewes and Johnson"s Pretty Boy Floyd were presented Best in Show honors. In 1978, Brentcliffe Jill won her first Best in Show and went on to become the all-time top-winning Harrier with 17 Best in Shows and 52 Hound Group wins. While most Harriers in the U.S. are family companions, some are also used to hunt rabbit and game that is too fast for most Beagles.
Harriers are medium-size dogs. They stand between 19 and 21 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
As a typical pack hound — a dog that"s used to working as part of a group — the gentle Harrier is outgoing and friendly, never aggressive toward other dogs. He"s also a typical hound in that he"s an independent thinker and can be stubborn. It"s important to train him using methods that will persuade him that being obedient is his idea. Positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior — is the way to go with this breed. He"s a good watchdog and will alert you to strange sounds or the approach of people. If you"re not home, he"ll watch the burglar come in and cart off your silver. Like every dog, Harriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Harrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Harriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Harriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Harriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Harriers have a lot of energy and stamina. They are great companions if they get enough exercise, but if not, they may become destructive. Harriers are not recommended for apartment dwellers. They do best in homes that have large yards or acreage for them to run. Yards need fences that your Harrier can"t dig under or jump over. Harriers can live outside with proper shelter from the heat and cold, but prefer to be indoors, close to their family, whom they consider their pack. Harriers bay — a prolonged bark — when they"re bored or lonely, so it"s not a good idea to leave them alone in the backyard for hours at a time, especially if you have neighbors nearby. These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn"t mean getting into mischief! Give your adult Harrier a long walk with lots of time for sniffing or take him jogging every day. Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Harrier pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies can eat as much as 4 cups a day, divided into three meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. More important than the amount of food your Harrier gets is his overall condition. He should look muscular, not fat. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye exam and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. He should have a visible waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can"t feel the last two ribs, he needs less food and more exercise. If you can see his ribs, feed more. For more on feeding your Harrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Harriers have short, thick, shiny coats, and very soft ears. They can come in a wide variety of colors, but the most common colors seen in the U.S. are tri-colors (black, tan and white), and red and white. They resemble an English Foxhound, only smaller. The Harrier coat is easy to groom. Give him a weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush or hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand. Harriers shed a moderate amount, but regular brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. Check his long ears for foreign objects such as foxtails or burrs, especially if he"s been running out in the fields. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, it"s a good idea to clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Harrier may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Harrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Harrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Harrier accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Harrier is described as being excellent with children. As with all breeds, that comes with some qualifications. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Being pack dogs, Harriers enjoy the company of other dogs, whether or not they"re Harriers. They may view smaller animals, including cats, as prey, however. If they weren"t brought up with them from puppyhood, closely supervise their interactions with cats and other pets.

The Havanese shines his affectionate personality on everyone, including strangers, children, other dogs, and even cats. But his family will get the lion"s share of his love; given the choice, he"ll stick like glue to his owner"s side. The potential downside to all this devotion is that, when left alone, the Havanese can become anxious. This is definitely a housedog, and a Havanese who"s left in the backyard — or anywhere away from his family — is not a happy dog. His Velcro personality isn"t so surprising, considering he was bred to keep the wealthy families of his native island of Cuba company. Since then, however, the Havanese has proven that he"s good for much more than warming laps. Havanese dogs are quite trainable, and they"ve worked as therapy and assistance dogs, sniffed out mold and termites, and shown off their clownish antics as performing dogs. They"ve also got a surprising amount of energy for their size, and for the family looking to compete, the Havanese will happily tackle such sports as agility, freestyle, obedience, and flyball. As with many small dogs, it"s common for adoring owners to overindulge their Havanese. They"ll probably regret it — bad habits, such as eating only people food, can form very quickly. This breed is a sharp con artist, and you may find that your Havanese is training you, rather than the other way around. In spite of his quirks, or maybe even because of them, the Havanese is a wonderful and versatile pet.
The Havanese is a companion dog that thrives on being with his family. He can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone, and does best when someone is home during the day to keep him company. Although they generally outgrow this, it"s quite common for Havanese puppies (among other breeds) to eat their own stools. Scoop your puppy"s poop right away so he can"t indulge in this icky habit. The long, silky coat of the Havanese is beautiful, but requires regular brushing and care. Many owners prefer to clip it short, but if you want to show your dog, you"ll have to let it grow long and invest a good amount of time in grooming, or money in paying a groomer. Another reason to keep it long: If you live in a warm climate, the long coat helps keep your dog cool. The Havanese does well in all types of housing, from apartments to homes with large yards. But he"ll probably bark when he sees someone passing by the house or when he hears a strange noise. The good news is that he doesn"t bark just for the sake of hearing his own voice. The Havanese loves to watch the world from up high, and will find his way onto the backs of sofas and tables to watch the day pass by. Paper is a favorite toy for the Havanese, and this clever little breed will go out of his way to find it, even sniffing through the jackets of your guests. Toilet paper, which can give him hours of shredding pleasure, is a special treat. Toss him a roll, and your house will soon look like it"s been hit by Halloween pranksters. The Havanese needs as much exercise as a larger dog. A long walk or an active game each day should do it. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
After Columbus claimed Cuba for Spain in 1492, Spanish settlers began arriving on the island. With them came their small companion dogs — the ancestors of what"s now the Bichon family of dogs. These dogs interbred and — isolated from other dogs by island life, and later, by trade restrictions imposed on Cuba by Spain — they began to develop into the Havanese we know today. Their signature coat was thick and silky, which helped insulate the dog from the tropical sun (the coat is like raw silk floss, profuse, but extremely light and soft, and insulates against the tropical rays in much the same way that yards of silk sari protect the women of India). By the early 1800s, Havanese were gracing the laps of many aristocratic families in Cuba. European travelers who became enamored with the breed brought dogs back to England, Spain, and France. The breed became trendy in Europe in the mid-1800s, and Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens were among his well-known fans at the time. Like most breed trends, this one petered out. At one point the Havanese became almost extinct, even in his native Cuba. A few Cuban families still bred and kept the dogs, however, and with the Cuban Revolution in 1959, 11 Havanese were brought to the U.S. in the arms of their owners. These canine refugees are the ancestors of most of the Havanese outside of Cuba today. The renaissance of the breed began in the 1970s,when an American couple who bred dogs found a few descendents of the 11 dogs who were brought from Cuba. Charmed by their intelligence and affectionate nature, they began tracking down other Havanese and working to reestablish the breed. Because most Havanese outside of Cuba today can trace their ancestry to just 11 dogs, breeders are working to widen the gene pools of the American-bred Havanese. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1995.
Males and females stand 8 1/2 to 11 1/2 inches tall, and weigh 7 to 13 pounds.
The Havanese is a gentle and affectionate breed that thrives on human companionship. Your Havanese will often follow you from room to room throughout the day, and he can get very anxious when left alone. He"s intelligent as well, and will enjoy making you laugh with goofy antics, or simply sitting on your lap watching the world go by. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Havanese needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Havanese puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Havanese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Havanese will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Havanese, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds of dogs. Although it"s a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can show up in a puppy born to parents free of the disease. Treatments include medication, weight loss if the dog is overweight, nutritional supplements, and sometimes surgery. Elbow Dysplasia: Elbow dysplasia is similar to hip dysplasia; it"s a degenerative disease that affects the elbow joint. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, causing the joint to be malformed and weakened. The disease varies in severity; some dogs only develop a little stiffness, others become lame. The treatment is surgery, weight management, and medication. Chondrodysplasia: This is a genetic disorder that"s commonly mislabeled as "dwarfism." Affected dogs have abnormally short limbs for the breed. This can range in severity from nearly normal to crippling. In less severe cases, dogs can live full and healthy lives, but any dog with this disorder should not be bred. Legg-Perthes Disease: Legg-perthes causes a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone, until the bone eventually dies off, collapses, and becomes deformed. The result is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It"s unclear what causes legg-perthes, but it may be inherited or injury related. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Dogs generally do well after the surgery, and many suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes. Cataracts: A cataract is opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes vision loss. The affected eye has a cloudy appearance. It is an inherited disease and usually occurs with old age, but can occur at any age. Cataracts are treated by surgical removal. Deafness: Deafness provides many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but deafness usually cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many products on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you both. Patellar Luxation: Also known as a "trick knee," patellar luxation is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patellia, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness or an abnormal gait. Treatment for patellar luxation is usually surgery. Portosystemic Shunt: A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal blood flow where the blood from the digestive tract bypasses the liver and continues to the systemic venous circulation. When this occurs, toxins that are normally removed by the liver are circulated through the body leading to other diseases, such as hepatic encephalopath. Portosystemic shunts usually occur in conjunction with another disease and symptoms include poor balance, loss of appetite, lethargy, blindness, depression, weakness, seizures, disorientation, and coma. A change in diet and surgery can help treat the problem. Heart Murmur: A disturbance in the blood flow is the cause of heart murmurs. There are five grades of heart murmurs; they are graded on how audible the murmur is. Heart murmurs are an indicator of disease; treatment is necessary, which can include medication, special diet, and exercise restrictions. Mitral Valve Insufficiency: Mitral valve insufficiency is more commonly seen in older dogs when the mitral valve, which is found between the left atrium and ventricle, begins to fail. When this happens, the mitral valve fails to prevent the flow of blood into the left atrium. This can cause heart failure. Symptoms include hypertension, fluid in the lungs, and a decrease in strength of the heart muscle. Treatment includes medication, change of diet, and exercise restrictions.
Although the Havanese is a small breed, he has a fair amount of energy to burn. A lengthy walk or an active game of fetch each day will keep him happy. The Havanese does well in a variety of homes, from apartments to large homes with yards — as long as he"s an indoor dog. This breed isn"t suited for life in the backyard. He is happiest when he is with his family. Although they"re not overly yappy, they do bark at passersby, so if your home has noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you. His eagerness to please his owners makes the Havanese fairly easy to train in most cases. Basic obedience, beginning with puppy classes, is recommended. Housetraining, however, can be particularly challenging for a Havanese, so you"ll need to be especially patient during this process. You"ll get there, but crate training is a must. Separation anxiety can be a serious concern for the Havanese and his owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don"t leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied. Though he"s small and fuzzy, a Havanese isn"t a toy. Like all breeds, he needs to learn good canine manners. Don"t spoil him with table scraps or by carrying him all the time he"ll get fat or become overly possessive of you.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Havanese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Havanese, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Havanese coat is thick but silky, soft, and light, and it doesn"t shed easily. The coat is long and ranges from straight to curly, although wavy is considered the ideal for the show ring. It comes in white, black, black and tan, sable, gray, and a myriad of other colors and markings. Many owners clip the Havanese coat short to make it easier to care for. But if you show your Havanese — or just want to look like you do — you"ll have to keep it long, and should expect to do a lot of grooming. When kept long, the coat needs daily brushing to prevent mats from forming, and frequent baths to keep it clean. In general, it"s wise to keep the hair above the eyes tied up to prevent irritation — it looks cute, too. Unless you"re highly motivated and skilled, you"re probably better off with a professional groomer. Owners can learn to groom their dogs, but it takes a dedicated person to keep this breed"s coat in good shape. Watery eyes and resulting tearstains are common in the Havanese. Keep in mind that excessive tearing can signal an eye problem and should be checked by a veterinarian. However, most tearstains are not serious, and the cause is simply unknown. You can improve the stained look by keeping the hair around the eyes clean (wipe daily with a damp cloth). There are whitening products on the market made specifically for lightening the stains, which some owners find helpful. Brush your Havanese"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Havanese enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Havanese to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Havanese is an excellent family dog who"s affectionate with everyone, including kids of all ages and other dogs and pets. But because he"s so small, he could easily get hurt by accident, so it"s especially important to teach kids how to treat the dog. You should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Havanese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Havanese in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Havanese rescue.

He comes from the trendy Spanish island of Ibiza, but the elegant Ibizan Hound is a canine classic whose history dates to the time of the pharaohs of Egypt. The beautiful red and white dog has a long, narrow head that resembles that of the Egyptian jackal god Anubis, large, erect ears that can point forward, sideways, or be folded backward, and flesh-colored pigment on the nose and eye rims, all of which combine to give him a unique appearance. More important is the wonderful personality that shines through. The Ibizan Hound, nicknamed Beezer by his fans, is playful and sometimes silly. He"s not a touchy-feely dog, but he enjoys snuggling with members of his family. The Ibizan can be reserved with strangers and protective of his home, but he should never be shy or aggressive. A medium-size sighthound who was developed to hunt rabbits and other small game, he was bred for speed, stamina, and determination. Today, those talents make this athletic dog a match for some of the top coursing breeds, as well as an excellent competitor in agility, thanks to his ability to jump high and far. Ibizan Hounds enjoy their comforts — that sleek, sculpted body needs cushioning, after all — and can become couch potatoes who enjoy spending their days sleeping. Their exercise needs are moderate. They"ll enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute walks or jogs daily. Whenever possible, give them a chance to run full out in a large, safely fenced area. Their ability to jump high from a standstill makes Ibizans notorious as counter surfers. Never trust them alone with food, no matter how out of the way you think it is. Outdoors, protect them with a secure fence that"s at least six feet high. Ibizans cannot be trusted off-leash unless they are in a fenced yard. They have a strong prey drive and will chase anything that moves quickly. For this reason, they"re not suited to families who have pets such as rabbits, although they get along fine with other dogs and can learn to live with cats if they"re raised with them. The Ibizan Hound comes in two coat types, shorthaired and wirehaired, and both are easy to maintain. Regardless of whether you want to compete or simply want a wonderful companion, this could be the breed for you. An Ibizan will walk or run with you, love you, and always make you laugh.
Ibizan Hounds do well in apartments if they are properly exercised. They must be kept on leash whenever they are not in a securely fenced area. Beezers have a strong prey drive and will pursue moving objects heedless of your commands. Ibizan Hounds are excellent jumpers. It takes at least a 6-foot fence to confine them to a yard. Underground electronic fences are not recommended for this breed. Beezers need daily exercise. If their exercise requirements are not met, they can become bored and destructive. Male Ibizan Hounds may develop poor appetites when they are adolescents. Encourage them to eat, but don"t go overboard with food bribes, elaborate meals, or hand feeding; you"ll simply end up with a picky eater. Beezers become cold easily. If you live in a cold or wet climate, purchase a coat for your dog. Ibizan Hounds are excellent with children, but all dogs should be supervised when they are with young children. These dogs are generally quiet indoors and can become couch potatoes but they need a daily walk or run. Ibizan Hounds are expert counter surfers so don"t leave food out, even if you think it"s out of your dog"s reach. Ibizan Hounds are generally not aggressive but they do have a high prey drive and are not best suited for homes with small animals. They can learn to get along with cats if they"re raised with them, but outdoor cats and other animals are fair game. Ibizan Hounds are a rare breed. Expect to spend time on a waiting list if you"re interested in one of these dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
When King Tut"s tomb was opened in 1922, one of the treasures found inside it was a life-size statue of the jackal god Anubis, the Watchdog of the Dead, and the resemblance to the modern Ibizan Hound was striking. The carving and other artifacts from the time of the pharaohs suggest that dogs like the Ibizan Hound have existed for 5,000 years, making them one of the most ancient types of dogs. Turns out that supposition probably isn"t correct, though. Genetic research has shown that the modern-day Ibizan, as well as his cousin, the Pharaoh Hound, are recent reconstructions of an older type and don"t actually have a lineage that stretches back thousands of years. The age of the Ibizan aside, how did this type of dog end up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, from which he takes his name? The Phoenicians, the most adventurous and well-traveled traders of the time, may have taken him there in the 8th or 9th century BCE. On Ibiza, the lithe and speedy hound traversed rough terrain, using his splendid sight and hearing to seek out his prey: rabbits and hares. Ibizans lived a harsh life on their Spanish island, a life that shaped them to hunt with skill, tenacity, and patience. They might have remained there, little known, but for the importation of a pair, Hannibal and Certera, by Colonel and Mrs. Consuelo Seoane to Rhode Island in 1956. They produced the first American litter of eight puppies which, along with several other imports, became the foundation of the breed in the United States. The Ibizan Hound was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1979 and first appeared at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1980. He remains a rare breed today. The Ibizan Hound ranks 138th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
A male Ibizan Hound stands 23.5 to 27.5 inches and weighs 50 pounds; a female is 22.5 to 26 inches and 45 pounds.
The lively Ibizan is attracted by anything that moves and will run after cats, rabbits, or anything else that looks like it might be fun to chase. His large, mobile ears are indicative of his super sense of hearing, which makes him an excellent watchdog. He might not bark an alarm, but if you see those ears twitching, you"ll know something or someone is around. With his family, the Ibizan is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. He may be reserved at first with strangers, but he should never be shy or aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Ibizan Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Ibizan puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Ibizan Hounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Beezers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Beezers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Seizures: Seizures can have a number of causes. They can be hereditary; they can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or they can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Ibizan Hound has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Axonal Dystrophy: Axonal Dystrophy is a rare neurological disorder that is seen occasionally in Ibizan Hounds. It affects young puppies. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Deafness: Deafness can affect one or both ears. Puppies and adults can be tested to verify that their hearing is sound. If your Ibizan has hearing loss, he"ll require special training techniques, as well as extra patience. Aids such as vibrating collars can help. Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Veterinary ophthalmologists can determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Cases can range from mild to severe. Retinal dysplasia shouldn"t affect a dog"s ability to function as a companion, but affected dogs shouldn"t be bred.
With their quiet nature and moderate exercise needs, Ibizans are suited to most living situations, from condos to homes with yards, as long you can provide them with a couple of daily walks or runs. They aren"t trustworthy off leash, however, and should never be allowed to run free except in a safely fenced area. An Ibizan is an excellent jumper and should be confined by a fence that"s at least six feet high. Don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep him in your yard; the desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock. An Ibizan is an excellent walking or jogging companion and will enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute outings daily. He"ll appreciate any opportunity to run free, although he may take advantage of it for only a few minutes. Be careful not to exercise puppies too much until they reach maturity. The general rule is 5 minutes for every month of age; i.e. a 5-month-old puppy should receive no more than 25 minutes of exercise per day. Train your Beezer with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Hounds in general weren"t created to work closely with people, so they need short, fun training sessions that will hold their interest. Ibizan Hounds are intelligent and can learn quickly, but they"ll become bored if training is repetitive. If you train your Ibizan correctly, he"ll be an eager, enthusiastic student, but if your teaching methods are harsh or boring, this sensitive dog will refuse to respond to you. Ibizans aren"t difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, however, as an aid to housetraining and to prevent your Ibizan puppy or adolescent from getting into mischief when you"re not around to supervise. Remember that he has a slender body with little fat for padding and provide a cushion for his crate. Otherwise, your Ibizan may find his quarters uncomfortable.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Ibizan Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Beezer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Ibizan Hound can have a coat that"s shorthaired or wirehaired. The wirehaired coat can be one to three inches long, with the longest hair on the back, the back of the thighs, and the tail. He may sport a moustache on his muzzle. Whether he has a short or wire coat, the Beezer"s hair is hard to the touch. Ibizans can be white, red (ranging from a light yellow-red called lion to a deep red), or red and white. Don"t be taken aback by his pigmentation. His nose and eye rims are supposed to be flesh-colored, not black. It"s easy to groom an Ibizan, no matter which type of coat he has. Brush him weekly to remove loose hair and keep his coat shiny and skin healthy. You can brush him more often if you want to reduce the amount of hair he sheds. Bathe only as needed. Brush your Beezer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Ibizan enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Ibizan to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Because they"re so playful and silly, Ibizans are good with children. They can be gentle but may chase young children who are running around. They"re probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Ibizans enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats, if they"re introduced at an early age. Your housecat will fare best with an Ibizan if he"s the type to stand his ground rather than run. Cats or other animals that wander into their yard are fair game, however.

It"s thought that invading Vikings brought the ancestors of this breed with them to Iceland in the ninth century. Thanks to the isolation of Iceland, today"s Icelandic Sheepdogs — also called the Icelandic Spitz or Icelandic Dog — probably look a lot like their ancestors. For centuries the Icelandic Sheepdog was used to protect flocks, especially lambs, from birds of prey, and to this day he retains the habit of watching the sky and barking at birds. He also barks to alert his family to anything and everything that he sees or hears. He"s too friendly to be much of a guard dog, but you"ll never be surprised by visitors. Affectionate, confident, and playful, the Icelandic Sheepdog gets along well with people and other dogs. Males tend to be more laidback and cuddly than females. Trained with consistency and patience, Icelandics learn quickly and willingly.

Early Irish Setters came in red or red and white, but eventually breeders began to focus only on the red varieties, and the red-and-white setters almost disappeared. They were saved from extinction, however, and now they"re considered a separate breed from their Irish Setter cousins. As gundogs, they take their own sweet time in learning their duties, but eventually become loyal and reliable hunters. They display a strong zest for life and make great friends for kids who are big enough to stand up to their rambunctious play. Give them a home with lots of room to run, and be prepared to train them with patience and consistency.

Who says blondes have more fun? Any self-respecting Irish Setter would dispute that claim. These fun-loving dogs are tremendously likeable, not only for their flame-colored hair, but also for their athleticism, grace, and enthusiasm. When you live with an Irish Setter, you can be assured of having a happy, friendly companion who"s always ready to rock and roll. Originally developed as a bird dog, the Irish Setter retains the drive and energy of his forefathers. There"s nothing he enjoys more than doing new things and going new places, especially if they involve birds. Although he"s not seen as much in the field as some other sporting breeds, his hunting instinct is still strong. Once he"s trained on birds, he never needs a refresher course. While the Irish Setter loves everyone, he"s not suited to every home. He"s brimming with energy and requires a minimum of an hour of exercise daily. A large fenced yard or acreage where he can run is important, as is an active family who will include him in everything they do. He can develop separation anxiety or become destructive if he"s left to his own devices. Irish Setters come in two types: show and field dogs. Irish Setter show dogs are heavier and larger than field dogs, with a heavier, thicker coat. Both types meet the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look and act. Regardless of size and coat, the Irish Setter should maintain his natural ability to be a gundog. Beyond their talents in the field, Irish Setters excel at many other activities, including obedience, rally, tracking, and agility competition. With their wonderful temperaments, they make terrific therapy dogs and can be found visiting hospices, retirement homes, and children"s hospitals, spreading the gift of their warmth, humor, and love. Irish Setters are known for their intelligence, but they"re also mischievous and independent. Training them requires much patience and consistency. This breed is slow to mature, so you"ll have a full-grown dog with puppylike enthusiasm and activity levels for several years. Not surprisingly, they"re great playmates for active older children, but they can be overwhelming for toddlers, who may find themselves bowled over by this rascally redhead. The Irish Setter has been loved by movie stars, presidents, and ordinary people who admire him for his joyful spirit. He"s a wonderful companion who will keep you fit and make you laugh throughout your life.
Irish Setters become very attached to the people in their lives and can suffer from serious separation anxiety. They become very unhappy when they are left alone for more than a few hours and this unhappiness usually results in destructive behavior. Irish Setters do not make good outdoor dogs and need to stay inside, close to their family. The high-energy, athletic Irish Setter needs room to run and the best place for him to do that is in a large, fenced yard. Irish Setters need lots of exercise and should be exercised twice a day for at least half an hour each time. Irish Setters need obedience training to channel their mischievous and sometimes stubborn nature. Irish Setters do very well with other animals and children. It is important, however, to properly socialize your puppy regardless of the breed"s temperament or your living situation. You might not have children or other pets now, but that could change. Lack of socialization can cause many difficulties. Irish Setters need to be groomed daily or every other day to keep their long, silky coats from becoming tangled. They are moderate shedders, so you will have some hair in your house, especially during shedding seasons. Irish Setters do not mature quickly. Some dogs settle down by the age of 2, but others remain puppylike their entire lives. Irish Setters are inquisitive by nature and will get into anything they can find or reach. This trait can also make training more difficult because they generally have a hard time staying focused. If you can keep them interested in training, they learn quickly. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
It"s not surprising that this handsome redhead comes from Ireland, which is famous for fine and beautiful dogs. The Irish Setter appears to have been developed there in the 18th century, probably the result of combining English Setters, spaniels, pointers, and Gordon Setters. Those first Irish Setters were sometimes called red spaniels — a clue to their heritage, perhaps — or modder rhu, Gaelic for "red dog." Often, they were white and red instead of the solid dark red we see today. Some, described as "shower of hail" dogs, had red coats sprinkled with small white spots. The Irish Earl of Enniskillen may have started the fad for solid red dogs. By 1812, he would have no other kind in his kennels. Other Irish breeders of the time who preferred the red dogs were Jason Hazzard of Timaskea in County Fermanagh and Sir St. George Gore. A dog named Elcho was the first Irish Setter imported to the United States. He arrived in 1875 and became a star not only in the show ring but also in the field. The first Irish Setter registered by the American Kennel Club was Admiral, in 1878. They quickly became one of the most popular breeds in America and a favorite in the show ring. Between 1874 and 1948, 760 Irish Setters became conformation champions, while only five became field champions. This sparked alarm for some fanciers of the original breed, and in 1940 the magazine Field and Stream called for a resurrection of the breed as a working dog. Today, it"s not unusual to see two types: the larger, heavier show dog, and the lighter, sleeker field dog. The Irish Setter"s popularity soared in the 1960s and 1970s, thanks to the books and movie featuring an Irish Setter named Big Red, as well as the presence of Irish Setter King Timahoe at the White House during the Nixon administration. Today, the Irish Setter ranks 68th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
The typical male Irish Setter stands 27 inches at the shoulder and weighs 70 pounds; females are 25 inches and weigh 60 pounds.
The Irish Setter is fun-loving, playful, and affectionate, always ready for a rollicking good time. He can be mischievous and isn"t above raiding your underwear drawer and prancing into the living room bearing a leopard-print thong in his teeth — while guests are there, natch. Irish Setters are outgoing and love people. They aren"t really guard dogs, although they"ve been known to step in and protect their people as needed. They are, however, excellent watchdogs and will bark to let you know of visitors or intruders. Irish Setters are slow to mature and will retain their puppy enthusiasm for several years and often throughout their life. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Irish Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Canine Leukocyte (CAD): Canine Leukocyte is an inherited abnormality that affects the white blood cells ability to fight infection. This disease impairs the immune system and is found in Irish Setters. Dogs who have this disease will suffer from immunological complications and reoccurring infections. Breeders are currently trying to remove Canine Leukocyte from their breeding lines and there is a DNA test that can be done to show that a dog is free of the gene. It is important to ask your potential breeder if their dogs have been screened for CLAD. Epilepsy: The Irish Setter can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Irish Setter has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. A new DNA test for PRA will help to reduce the incidence of this disease in the breed. Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD): Hypertrophic osteodystrophy, which causes lameness and is linked to excessive levels of protein and calcium in the diet, may affect puppies between 4 and 8 months of age. Besides lameness, signs include fever, appetite loss, swollen joints, lethargy, and reluctance to walk. It can occasionally be fatal. HOD can be difficult to diagnose, so make sure your veterinarian is aware that the condition can affect Irish Setters. It"s treated with a course of steroids, antibiotics, and pain relievers. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Panosteitis: Panosteitis is a disease that affects the bones, especially the limb bones, of primarily young large breed dogs. A lameness in one or more leg is the result of inflammation in the bone. The disease usually lasts from 1 to 6 months and the dog will go through periods of pain and periods of good health. There is no treatment but it is managed with anti-inflammatories and pain relievers.
The best home for an Irish Setter is one with a large fenced yard or acreage. This breed needs room to run. He is a hunting dog, so he must be contained by a fence or restrained by a leash to prevent him from wandering off. He should live indoors with his family, never alone in a kennel or backyard. Irish Setters need at least an hour of exercise daily. This can be done in a variety of different ways, but one of the best ways is to allow the Irish Setter to run. He"s a great jogging companion and will also enjoy running alongside a bicycle. Long walks, playing fetch, swimming, and of course hunting are other excellent ways to exercise your Irish Setter. Irish Setter puppies have different exercise needs. From 8 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your Irish Setter pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile, run on soft surfaces such as grass or dirt, and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Irish Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force. Training an Irish Setter is primarily a matter of preventing boredom on his part. He tends to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Help him focus by keeping him entertained. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and avoid repetitive exercises. Switch rewards and activities frequently to retain his interest. He accepts fair corrections good-naturedly. Crate training is a must for your Irish Setter puppy. This breed is curious and will examine anything and everything with his mouth. A crate will help keep your puppy and your belongings safe when you aren"t around to supervise. Most Irish Setters are easy to housetrain. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Irish Setter puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he"s 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it"s important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Irish Setter in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Setter, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
His beautiful coat is one of the characteristics that give the Irish Setter his reputation as one of the most beautiful breeds in the dog world. Short and fine on the head and forelegs, the burnished mahogany or rich chestnut red coat is moderately long and straight on the rest of the body, with long, silky feathering on the ears, the backs of the forelegs and thighs, and the tail, and a fringe of hair on the belly and chest. In the show ring, Irish Setters are trimmed to emphasize the lean head and clean neck and to show the natural outline of the foot. Brush your Irish Setter at least every other day to keep his coat shiny and tangle-free. Check for burrs and other debris any time he"s been out in the field or on a hike. Unless he rolls in something stinky, he shouldn"t need a bath more than a couple of times a year, as long as you keep him well brushed. You can bathe him more frequently if you want, however, and you"ll need to if you plan to show him. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his coat and skin. All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Irish Setter"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Irish Setter may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Irish Setter"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Irish Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Irish Setter to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Setters are good friends for active older children, but they can be too rambunctious for toddlers. It"s all too easy for an Irish Setter to accidentally knock a child down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Setters are also good with other dogs in the household, as well as cats, especially if they"re raised with them, but they might see pet birds as prey since those are what they are bred to hunt.

The Irish Terrier"s motto is "No fear." Nicknamed "Daredevil," this medium-size, agile dog has a tight, wiry red coat and a snootful of courage. He"s animated and loyal, always on guard, and willing to take on anything that comes his way and threatens his people and home. With that tough terrier attitude, however, comes a need for training and socialization from an early age. Irish Terriers are extremely intelligent and learn easily, but any training must work around their independent, willful spirit. If you can make the dog think that training is his idea, you"ll get a happy worker who meets or exceeds any goals you may have set for him. That"s balanced by a reckless spirit that can be blind to consequences, so it can be necessary to protect him from his sometimes intemperate desire to guard his loved ones. Irish Terriers are wonderful watchdogs, barking to warn their owners of anything new. Some dogs will become excessive barkers if their behavior isn"t controlled from the start. Thanking the dog for the alert and then distracting him with another command or game is a good way to make sure your dog learns to control his barking. Irish Terriers are excellent people dogs when they receive early socialization, and this helps make them wonderful family companions. They"re best suited to families where someone is home during the day. They aren"t overly active indoors and are happy to relax with their people, but they need exercise in the form of walks and occasional romps in a securely fenced area. The Irish Terrier has excellent hunting skills and a strong desire to seek out and destroy vermin, so a fenced yard and leashed walks are necessary for his safety. He"ll chase rapidly moving objects without paying attention to where the chase is leading him. Irish Terriers adore children and are great playmates, especially when raised with them. Make sure very young children are supervised at all times to prevent injury to both the dog and the child. Irish Terriers can learn to get along with cats if they"re raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not be trustworthy around smaller pets, especially pets from the rodent family such as mice, rats, hamsters, and gerbils. Their terrier instinct to hunt this type of animal may be too strong to overcome. This breed does not do well with other dogs. Irish Terriers can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex, and they don"t back down from a challenge. They will fight to the point of serious injury to themselves or the other dog. Being fearless, they"ll take on dogs much larger than themselves without thought for the consequences. Make sure your dog is on leash and you have control when around other dogs at any time. With his speed, endurance, and grace the Irish Terrier is an excellent competitor who loves the challenge of the agility ring. He can do well in the sports of obedience and rally, and his soft mouth and love of water make him a capable hunting dog who can retrieve game birds on land or from water. Irish Terriers are also excellent show dogs. If you"re looking for a versatile, active, spunky dog who will watch over your family for many years, the Irish Terrier could be the breed for you. He"s not one of the more well-known breeds, so finding a breeder with puppies can be difficult. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list and to pay a higher price than you might for a more popular breed. The expense is well worth it, though, admirers say. If you find the right dog, the Irish Terrier can be the most wonderful companion your family will ever have.
Irish Terriers will not necessarily get along with any other dog. They will fight if challenged by another dog and will not back down. Irish Terriers can be stubborn. They are terriers and will dig if your yard has moles or other rodents. Irish Terries can be barkers. Irish Terriers must have regular opportunities to burn off their energy. Irish Terriers need mental challenges such as training and play to thrive. Obedience training is highly recommended. The "come" command can be difficult to teach. They can be dominant and attempt to take over the household. You must be consistent and teach them that you are in charge at all times. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Irish Terrier is probably one of the oldest Terrier breeds and may have as one of its ancestors the now-extinct black and tan Terrier and a larger wheaten-colored terrier. He emerged as a recognized breed in 1875 or thereabouts, at a dog show in Glasgow, Scotland, of all places. By 1879, two Irish Terriers, Ch. Erin and Killney Boy, were producing many champions and are considered the foundation of the breed. The 1880s were a banner decade for the Irish Terrier. During that time, they were the fourth most popular breed in Britain. They were also the source of a controversy that led to a major change in the appearance of British dogs. It had been common practice to crop the ears of terriers and some other breeds, but in 1889 the Irish Terrier Club required that all dogs born after a certain date that year have uncropped ears if they were to be shown under Kennel Club rules. This led to a great outcry but eventually resulted in the banning of ear cropping for any breed in Great Britain. The breed rapidly spread to the United States. The first Irish Terrier was shown at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1881, and the first Irish Terrier registered with the American Kennel Club was Aileen in 1885. The Irish Terrier Club of America was founded in 1896. In World War I, Irish Terriers distinguished themselves as messenger dogs and sentinels, receiving many accolades for bravery and loyalty. The commandant of the British War Dog School, Lt. Col. E. H. Richardson, wrote of them: "Many a soldier is alive today through the effort of one of these Terriers.... They are extraordinarily intelligent, faithful, and honest, and a man who has one of them as a companion will never lack a true friend." Given his fine qualities, it"s surprising that the Irish Terrier has slowly faded from popularity. He"s rarely seen in the show ring with the exception of specialty shows, which are well attended, but his popularity may receive a boost from the 2007 movie Firehouse Dog. Irish Terriers rank 123rd among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The ideal weight for males is 27 pounds, for females 25 pounds. The height at the shoulder is 18 to 20 inches.
The Irish Terrier was created to be a companion, guard dog, and hunter. As such, he"s good-tempered, spirited, alert, and adaptable. He"s also plucky, reckless, curious, and devoted. Those things all sound wonderful, and they are, but those characteristics aren"t always easy to live with. This is an independent, smart, strong-willed dog who"s scrappy with other dogs. He needs mental challenges in the form of training and play, physical exercise, and loving but firm discipline. On the plus side, Irish Terriers love people and are often friendly toward strangers. They"re not a one-person dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, an Irish Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
The Irish Terrier is a healthy breed and doesn"t have any common health problems. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Some Irish Terriers are inveterate escape artists, so fence height should be higher than one might think is needed for a dog this size. A good height is five to six feet. Like all terriers, ITs are diggers, so the bottom of your fence should be escape-proof as well. You may need to set it in concrete or line the bottom of it with chicken wire. An underground electronic fence will not keep an Irish Terrier confined. More important, it won"t prevent other dogs from coming onto your property and getting into a fight with your IT. The energetic Irish Terrier needs moderate exercise. Give him two or three walks on leash of 20 to 30 minutes each day. A chance to romp in a safely fenced area is also welcome. He"s not a true running breed, but he"s a good companion for joggers who go at an easy to moderate pace. He"s not a distance runner or a fast-paced dog. Condition him gradually, and wait until he"s fully grown before you start jogging with him. If you can control his tendency to bark, an Irish Terrier will do as well in an apartment as in a house. He should live indoors with his people, and given sufficient exercise, he"s a quiet, polite housemate. If you leave him alone in the backyard with no companionship or occupation, he"s likely to relandscape it with a number of holes. Puppy or adult, the Irish Terrier is playful, but his idea of play and yours may vary. He"ll enjoy shredding magazines or other papers, overturning the garbage or the laundry basket, surfing the kitchen counter or dining room table for something to eat (he"ll find a way up there) and, of course, barking at every passing car, dog, bicyclist — you get the idea. Dogproof your home, teach him what"s acceptable behavior and what"s not, and crate him when you can"t be there to supervise, especially during his curious puppyhood. A crate protects him from getting into trouble for being destructive, and it protects your belongings from destruction. When it comes to training, the Irish Terrier has a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. You"ve got to give him an incentive to do what you want, and if you don"t keep training fun and interesting, he"ll just ignore you. Training an Irish Terrier requires creativity, firmness, and positive reinforcement in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. He"s sensitive and won"t respond well to harsh treatment. Keep training sessions short, change them around a lot, and always end them when he"s done something well and you can praise him for it.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your adult Irish Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Irish Terrier is jacketed with dense, wiry hair. The hairs grow so closely together that even if you part them with your fingers, it"s hard to see the skin. It"s short enough that you can still see the outline of the body. At the base of the stiff outer coat is some finer and softer hair, lighter in color, which is the undercoat. The double coat protects the Irish Terrier from rough underbrush and cold or wet weather when he"s working or playing outdoors. His coat is bright red, golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). He may have a small patch of white on the chest. Puppies sometimes have black hair at birth, which should disappear before they are grown. Brush the coat weekly with a natural bristle brush to keep it clean and healthy. You must strip it by hand a couple of times a year if you want to keep the hard texture and bright color, a must if you plan to show your Irish Terrier. For companion dogs, it"s often easier to clip the coat, but be aware that it will become softer to the touch and lighter in color. You may or may not care about that. If you plan to strip it, ask the breeder to show you how. It"s the kind of thing you can do while you and your IT are watching a 30-minute television show. If you don"t mind the scruffy look, you can just leave the coat as is, with no stripping or clipping. Irish Terriers shed little and are sometimes referred to as nonallergenic or hypoallergenic. There is no truly nonallergenic breed. Every dog produces some allergens through skin dander (not hair), saliva, and urine. That said, some people with allergies do find that they can tolerate this breed. Individual dogs, even within the same breed, vary in the amount of allergens they produce, so the best thing you can do is to meet as many Irish Terriers as possible and see how you react around them. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Irish Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don"t get caught in the carpet and tear, and don"t scratch your legs when your Irish Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. It"s not exactly a grooming issue, but your Irish Terrier puppy"s ears may need to be "trained" to achieve those perfectly folded V-shaped ears that contribute to the Irish Terrier"s roguish demeanor. This involves gluing and taping the ears to the head until they fall right, usually at 4 to 8 months of age. If it"s necessary, your dog"s breeder can show you how.
It"s said that the little people (leprechauns) gave Irish Terriers to children to be their playmates. Their size and energy level make them great companions for active kids, but as always, they should both be supervised, especially if children are very young. Teach your puppy not to be rough or mouthy, and teach your child not to pull the dog"s tail or ears or hit him. Children should never approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Terriers don"t like strange dogs, and they can be aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Early socialization with lots of other dogs, strong leadership on your part, and neutering can go a long way toward reducing an Irish Terrier"s dog aggression, but they"re not a guarantee that you"ll turn him into a dog who"s buddy-buddy with other canines. If you have one Irish Terrier, he can probably learn to get along with one or more cats. Early socialization is key. More than one Irish Terrier may gang up on a cat or cats. Always supervise their interactions and, if necessary, separate them when you"re gone.

The Irish Water Spaniel is often mistaken for a large brown poodle because of his distinctive top knot and the curly hair that covers his body. While back in the deeps of time a Poodle ancestor may be lurking in his family tree, the Irish Water Spaniel is most definitely not a Poodle. Rather, he might be described as what the standard Poodle once was: a versatile hunting, pointing, and retrieving dog. Not surprisingly, given his name, the Irish Water Spaniel is known for his strong swimming skills and excels at retrieving waterfowl as well as upland game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. Not content with his striking looks and hunting talents, he"s an entertainer as well. The IWS is known for his clownish behavior. He often makes a game out of a simple task and always seems to be having a wonderful time. Irish Water Spaniels are highly intelligent, active, willing and energetic. The centuries of breeding that have contributed to their retrieving skills have also instilled in them a desire to please. This makes an Irish Water Spaniel relatively easy to train. That said, he has a mischievous streak that can cause him to be a challenge at times to deal with. The breed can do well in obedience work, but that mischievous, fun-loving personality may surface unexpectedly during competition and wreak havoc with your goals for that day. The Irish Water Spaniel is a relatively quiet dog for the most part. He seems to reserve his barking for times when it"s necessary to warn his family. His alert and inquisitive temperament makes him an excellent watchdog. While he"s usually devoted to the entire family, he may choose a particular person as his favorite. The Irish Water Spaniel"s dense coat does require some commitment to grooming on a regular basis. It must be brushed two to three times a week to prevent mats from forming. The natural oils in his water-repellent coat attract dirt and debris and hold it in the coat. Brushing helps to distribute the oil through the coat and removes any debris. An interesting characteristic is their webbed feet, which come in handy when they"re swimming. Irish Water Spaniels love to swim and will plunge into any nearby body of water if given half a chance. And they may not be ready to leave the water when you"re ready for them to. If you can provide this breed with opportunities to swim, do so! It"s great exercise for this high-energy dog. The Irish Water Spaniel can be the perfect companion for an active family with the time to socialize, train, and exercise him. He"ll be a devoted, loving member of the family and will entertain all with his clownish and mischievous attitude toward life. Your Irish Water Spaniel can be a hunting companion, conformation, obedience, agility, or rally competitor or just a friend and loving companion for everyone in the family.
Can have life-threatening reaction to sulfa drugs, Ivermectin and vaccines especially the leptospirosis component. This is a breed that is probably not suitable for the first time dog owner because he can be headstrong, and an independent thinker. Irish Water Spaniels have lots of energy and need daily exercise. Not every Irish Water Spaniel can be trusted to get along with smaller pets. Socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences — at an early age is needed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The exact origin of this breed as many others is debated among fanciers and shrouded in the mists of Ireland. The Irish Water Spaniel appeared in Ireland in the 1830s, mainly from the kennel of Justin McCarthy. His dog "Boatswain," whelped in 1834, is credited with being the sire of the modern breed. Mr. McCarthy would never reveal the sources of his breeding and took the secret with him when he died. Speculation focuses on the early Barbet or Poodle-type dogs from France that could have come to Ireland and possibly Portuguese Water Dogs that arrived on Portuguese fishing boats. There were also two types of water spaniels in Ireland at the time, one of which sported a curly coat and could have contributed to the breed"s makeup. The first show classes for the breed were at a show in Birmingham in 1862, and in 1899 the first Irish Water Spaniel ran in a field trial. There were four Irish Water Spaniels entered in the first Westminster Kennel Club show in 1877. The Irish Water Spaniel remains an active, popular working and show dog in his native country. The breed came to the United States in the 1870s but has never had the popularity that he enjoys in Ireland. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel ranks 139th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club, a well-kept secret indeed.
The IWS is the tallest member of the spaniel family. Males are 22 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 65 pounds; females are 21 to 23 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
True to his spaniel nature, the IWS is alert and inquisitive. Unlike many spaniels, however, he may be reserved toward strangers, although he should never be shy or aggressive. Irish Water Spaniels are highly trainable, but they"re independent thinkers and will do their best to get their own way whenever possible. This is especially true with young males testing their status. For this reason, they are probably not the best choice for a first-time dog owner who may not understand how to provide the guidance and sensible discipline this dog needs. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Irish Water Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your IWS puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Water Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Water Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Water Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Follicular Dysplasia: A group of syndromes that have hair loss and changes in coat quality in common. Hair loss in Irish Water Spaniels may first be noticed at 2 to 4 years of age over the back, and spreads slowly to most of the trunk. The coat change is progressive and permanent but has little effect on the dog"s health. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland, which is found in the neck. The mild symptoms of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs of this disease are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy and irregular heat cycles. The fur on the dog becomes course and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires a lifetime treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your IWS has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if necessary when the dog reaches maturity. Paronychia: This condition is not well understood. It occurs in the dog"s toenails, and you will often see dogs with it chewing on their feet. The problem can occur in dogs who have had their nails trimmed regularly. The toenail"s inner core becomes mushy and may become infected with bacteria and fungus, causing a foul odor. Even without an infection present the disease will progress. The outer shell of the nail eventually falls off, exposing the quick. One or more toes may be affected. Treatment is necessary to avoid suffering. Some owners eliminate allergens in the diet and reported satisfactory results; other owners had the toes amputated. Distichiasis: This minor condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your dog squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Megaesophagus: Megaesophagus is believed to be both a congenital disease and adult-onset disease in which the esophagus loses tone and dilates. This hinders the ability of the esophagus to transport food and can prevent breathing during swallowing. Dogs with megaesophagus often regurgitate food that has not reached the stomach. This is not a powerful active vomiting but more of a passive regurgitation where the food falls out of the dog"s mouth. It"s caused by nerve damage to the esophagus and in the case of young puppies the damage may improve as the dog grows. In adults, megaesophagus is usually preceded by another disease that causes nerve damage. The disease can be treated with medication and diet, but it"s difficult to manage and doesn"t always have good results. Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your IWS has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Irish Water Spaniels suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, signs include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your IWS carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual. Drug Sensitivity: Some breeds, including Irish Water Spaniels, show sensitivity to certain medications, including some antiparasitic and antibiotic drugs. Signs of this sensitivity range from tremors, depression, seizures, incoordination, hypersalivation, coma, and even death. Ask your veterinarian to become familiar with the drugs that can negatively affect the Irish Water Spaniel.
A hunting breed with a great deal of energy and stamina, the Irish Water Spaniel needs a yard to romp in and isn"t suited to apartment life. Give him at least an hour a day of running, long walks or hikes, or vigorous play such as retrieving a ball in the yard. If you have a pool or access to a lake, swimming is a great way for him to get exercise. Keep an eye on him just as you would a child, and be sure he knows how to get out of the pool safely. You can break up his activity into two or three 20- or 30-minute sessions throughout the day. As with any dog, don"t run him ragged in the heat of the day. Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he"s a year old, your IWS pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints. Irish Water Spaniels work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kind but firm consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The IWS who"s treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. An Irish Water Spaniel will make his own entertainment if you don"t.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. If you"re unsure whether your Irish Water Spaniel is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Irish Water Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Irish Water Spaniel has a double coat — a top coat and an under coat — with tight, crisp ringlets that cover the back, back, sides, and rear. Beneath the ribs the hair is longer, and curls and waves of hair cover the legs. Hair on the throat is short and smooth, forming a v-shaped patch. The curly body forms a sharp contrast with the smooth coat on the face, throat, toes, and tail. Speaking of the tail, it"s a striking characteristic of the breed. Wide at the root, where the tail meets the body, it tapers to a fine point. It"s covered with short, smooth hair and is known as a rat tail. The Irish Water Spaniel is always a solid liver color, described as deep reddish brown. You won"t see any white markings on him except for those due to graying from age. Irish Water Spaniels shed little to no hair, but they must be brushed two or three times a week to keep the coat from tangling or matting, as well as to keep it clean and healthy. The oil in the coat attracts debris and dirt. Regular brushing not only distributes the oil throughout the coat to keep the skin healthy but also removes the dirt and debris. The breed can be prone to ear infections due to the pendant earflap. In other words, those floppy ears hold in moisture, and the wet, warm environment is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and dry the ears every time your IWS goes swimming. To do this, gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your IWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Irish Water Spaniel"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your IWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your IWS to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Water Spaniels do best with children if they are raised with them. Early socialization — exposure to a variety of peoples, places, sights, sounds, and situations — also helps. Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Irish Water Spaniels can get along well with other pets in the family if introduced to them at a young age. Otherwise, supervise them carefully. They are hunting dogs and may view smaller animals, especially birds, as prey. Protect pet birds even if you"re sure your IWS understands they"re off limits. Some spaniels can learn that, if they"re taught from puppyhood, but don"t assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your IWS doesn"t pull your parakeet"s tail or your parrot won"t take a bite out of your Irish Water Spaniel"s sensitive nose.

When Irish eyes are smiling, you can be sure they belong to an Irish Wolfhound. He has a noble and commanding appearance, but beneath his shaggy eyebrows twinkle eyes with a sweet, gentle expression. This ancient breed originated in Ireland, where he served as both a war dog and hunting dog. He came close to extinction in the 19th century after the great prey animals — wolves, deer, and wild boars — had largely disappeared in Ireland, but the breed was revived and today is a wonderful companion who draws the admiration of many. The Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all dog breeds and the largest of the sighthounds — dogs that chase moving prey. Despite his distant past as a ferocious war dog, he"s a gentle giant who gets along with everyone, including children, other dogs, and sometimes even cats. He loves long walks, which are important in maintaining his huge body, but otherwise he"s satisfied to be a couch potato. While they"re quiet indoors, Irish Wolfhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Consider whether you"d be able to get one up and down the stairs if he were injured or sick. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard where they can have room to run. The Irish Wolfhound is not the ideal watchdog. He doesn"t bark an alarm, and although he has the size to deter many would-be intruders he doesn"t have the nature of a guard dog. He"s brave but not aggressive. Like any dog, the Irish Wolfhound isn"t the breed for everyone. His gigantic size alone is a consideration. He has several health issues that potential owners must be aware of. And he"s a short-lived breed who has only a 6- to 8-year life span. If you"re looking for a breed that lives many years and is easy to care for, then he"s not the breed for you. But if you"re looking for a companion who will fill your life with love, admiration, and sloppy kisses, then look no further.
Irish Wolfhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels inside, they need room to stretch out and aren"t built for negotiating stairs. Irish Wolfhounds require at least 40 minutes of daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard. Irish Wolfhounds need a fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey away from their yards. They should not be kept in a yard with underground electronic fencing. The desire to chase is too strong to be overcome by the threat of a momentary shock. The Irish Wolfhound is a gentle dog who usually gets along well with everyone. With early socialization and training, he"ll be gracious toward other dogs and forbearing of indoor cats. He"ll view outdoor cats and other animals as fair game. If you are looking for a long-lived breed, the Irish Wolfhound is not for you. He lives roughly 6 to 8 years and his giant size predisposes him to many health problems. Irish Wolfhounds do not make good guard dogs although their size can be a deterrent to a would-be intruder. The Irish Wolfhound is an average shedder and only needs to be brushed on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. You"ll need to strip the longer portions of his coat if you want to keep him looking like the Irish Wolfhounds that compete in the conformation ring. Irish Wolfhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing animals or other moving objects, such as radio-controlled cars. The Irish Wolfhound is not a pony and should not be ridden by children, no matter how small. His joints aren"t built for the strain. Nor is he built for pulling a cart or other vehicle. Irish Wolfhounds thrive when they are with their owners. They are not outdoor dogs, although they enjoy playing outside. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Throughout history, the Great Hound of Ireland has been a marvel wherever he went. Roman consul Aurelius wrote in 391 AD that "all Rome viewed with wonder" the seven Irish Wolfhounds that had been sent to him as a gift. And no wonder! The dog"s great size made him fearsome in battle and capable of pursuing the Irish elk, which stood six feet at the shoulder — double the Wolfhound"s height — as well as the wolf, the predator from which the Wolfhound eventually took his name. Before that, he was known simply as Cu, a Gaelic word that probably meant hound, wolf dog, or war dog. There are many mentions of the great dog in Irish literature over the centuries. He was used as a war dog, his job being to pull men down from horses or chariots. They were also used for hunting elk, boar, and wolves as well as guarding homes and livestock. The Irish Wolfhound was prized for his ferocity and bravery in battle. Irish law permitted only kings and nobles to own the Irish Wolfhound, and the number of dogs owned was related to the prestige of the title held. For example, members of the lesser nobility were limited to two Wolfhounds. Irish legends say that folk hero Finn MacCumhaill had 500 Irish Wolfhounds, with his two favorites being Bran and Sceolan, who were of magic birth. The Irish Wolfhound was a popular gift between rulers and other important people. Often they arrived wearing chains and collars made with silver and gold. A favorite tale is that of the Irish Wolfhound sent to the Prince of Wales, Llewellyn, by England"s King John in 1210. The hound was named Gelert, and Llewellyn loved him more than life itself. One day, Llewellyn went hunting and charged Gelert with guarding his baby son while he was gone. When he returned, he found the baby"s crib overturned and Gelert covered in blood. Mad with grief, he slew Gelert, but as the faithful dog lay dying, Llewellyn heard the cry of his son. He searched further and found the child, alive, next to the body of a wolf that Gelert had killed. Llewellyn mourned his dog forever after and erected a tomb in Gelert"s honor, which can still be seen in Caernarvon, Wales. Despite his fame, the Irish Wolfhound"s numbers declined over the years, especially after the elk and the wolf in Ireland were hunted to extinction. Irish Wolfhounds were kept by only a few families as ornamental dogs and rarely saw use in the field. The breed might have disappeared had it not caught the interest of Major H. D. Richardson. In the mid-1800s, Richardson wrote a book suggesting that the Irish Wolfhound and the Highland Deerhound were the same breed. He began breeding Irish Wolfhounds, basing his breeding program on the Glengarry Deerhounds. Another advocate of the Irish Wolfhound was a Captain George Augustus Graham, who used Glengarry Deerhounds, Borzoi, and a Tibetan Mastiff to revitalize the Irish Wolfhound breed. He also used Irish Wolfhounds that were crossed with Great Danes, including a Harlequin Great Dane. Graham founded the Irish Wolfhound Club in 1885 and England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1925. The first Irish Wolfhound registered with the American Kennel Club was Ailbe in 1897, and the Irish Wolfhound Club of America was founded in 1927. Today, the Irish Wolfhound ranks 77th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
A male Irish Wolfhound stands at least 32 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs at least 120 pounds. The Irish Wolfhound female is at least 30 inches tall and 105 pounds. Many are larger. Males usually average 34 to 35 inches and 140 to 180 pounds; females 32 to 34 inches and 115 to 140 pounds.
Intelligent and gentle, the Irish Wolfhound has a strong desire for human companionship. With his family, he"s calm, dignified, and responsive. He"s sensitive and must be trained using positive reinforcement such as praise and food rewards. Harsh words or physical punishment will cause him to shut down. When it comes to watchdog duties, he"s alert but not suspicious. There"s not an aggressive bone in his body, so he"s a poor choice as a guard dog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Irish Wolfhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Wolfhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Irish Wolfhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Wolfhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Wolfhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Irish Wolfhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is probably related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of the Irish Wolfhound is generally too much for the low-body-fat Irish Wolfhound. Choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds. Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or weight management or anti-inflammatory medication to control the pain. Liver Shunt: A liver shunt is an abnormal blood flow between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet. Heart Disease: Irish Wolfhounds can be prone to heart disease, primarily heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Fibrocartilaginous Embolic Myelopathy: This condition occurs when pieces of cartilaginous material obstruct blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, causing partial or complete paralysis of the hind legs. The condition usually affects dogs between the ages of 3 and 6 years and may occur suddenly during any activity. There is no treatment, but some dogs improve with time. The severity of the loss of use must be determined before a course of action can be decided. Some dogs can live out their lives with only minimal assistance, but others are fully paralyzed. If physical rehabilitation doesn"t help, euthanasia is the kindest option. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.
Despite his great size, the Irish Wolfhound is a housedog. He loves being with people and is calm indoors. He"s best suited to a home without stairs; going down them can damage his joints. Give him access to a securely fenced yard where he can run, and he"ll be happy. A fence is necessary to prevent this breed from chasing other animals. An underground electronic fence won"t do the job; the instinct to chase is much stronger than the fear of a momentary shock. Irish Wolfhound adults need a couple of 20-minute play times where they can run freely every day. They"ll enjoy a walk as well. Avoid any exercise an hour before meals and two hours after meals to decrease the risk of gastric torsion, or bloat. Puppies need free play in a securely fenced yard, but limit running to only a few minutes a day. They shouldn"t be taken on walks until they"re at least six months old. Start with short walks of no more than five minutes, and build up to walks of a mile over a three-month period. They shouldn"t reach a distance of two miles until they"re a year old. Continue this gradual and gentle exercise program until the Irish Wolfhound reaches maturity at 18 to 24 months of age. Giant breeds are prone to joint problems, and excessive exercise during their growth and development phase can damage their joints. Walks on leash are a must with this breed. They are sighthounds and will chase running animals when they see them, heedless of your calls to come. A sighthound on the chase will focus on his prey, not traffic, and can easily become injured or killed. He can also injure or kill the animal he"s pursuing, which won"t do much for your relationship with your neighbors if their Toy Poodle or Siamese cat is his victim. Irish Wolfhounds are intelligent and trainable if you"re consistent and use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise. They"re generally easy to housetrain, and a crate can help, although it shouldn"t be overused. Crate training is a great aid to housetraining, and it will also keep your belongings safe from your puppy and your puppy safe from your wrath because he chewed up your favorite shoes. The Irish Wolfhound should not be crated for long periods, however. Long hours in a crate can damage his joints.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Irish Wolfhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Irish Wolfhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Wolfhound coat is rough and hard. The hair on the eyes and under the jaw is wiry and long. A pet-quality Irish Wolfhound may have a softer or longer coat, but that doesn"t affect his ability to be a companion. Coat colors are gray, brindle, red, black, white, or fawn. Irish Wolfhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush your dog weekly to keep the coat healthy. He shouldn"t need a bath more than once or twice a year unless he gets into something stinky. To give the coat a neat look for the show ring or simply because you prefer it, gently pluck excess hair from the ears with your thumb and forefinger and use thinning scissors or a stripping knife to neaten the hair on the feet and tidy the hair on the side of the neck. Don"t remove too much; the Irish Wolfhound should have something of a mane. To finish, strip out long hair under the belly and at the base of the tail. You want your Irish Wolfhound to have a smooth, clean look that shows off his graceful lines. Brush your dog"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Irish Wolfhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Irish Wolfhounds are gentle with children, but simply because of their large size they can accidentally knock toddlers down and scare or injure them. They"re best suited to homes with older children. Irish Wolfhounds are not ponies, and children cannot ride them. Your Wolfhound can be injured if children try to ride him. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. With early socialization and training, your Irish Wolfhound should get along well with other dogs. He may chase small animals such as cats unless brought up with them and taught not to. It"s vital to properly introduce him to other animals in the household and supervise their interactions. He"ll consider outdoor cats and other small animals fair game.
Irish Wolfhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Irish Wolfhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Irish Wolfhound rescue.

If you"re an art lover, you may have seen the Italian Greyhound in centuries-old portraits, immortalized with their noble owners by famous artists. This slender, elegant dog is the smallest of the sighthounds — the group of dogs bred to hunt by sight and give chase — and closely resembles his much larger Greyhound cousin. Agile and athletic, he has a small, muscular body and an elegant high-stepping gait. The IG, as he"s often called, retains his instinct for hunting small game and will chase anything that moves. He can reach top speeds of 25 miles per hour, so if he gets loose he won"t be easy to catch. Although he"s small, he has lots of energy and appreciates plenty of opportunities to exercise. A fit IG can even make a good jogging partner. The Italian Greyhound has a gentle personality, loving and affectionate with family members, but often reserved or shy with strangers. Despite his mild nature, he has a surprisingly deep, big-dog bark, making him a good watchdog — although he"s too small to back up his barks and provide any actual protection. This is an intelligent breed who can be easy to train, but you"ll need to make it fun for him to overcome his "what"s in it for me?" attitude. When well trained, he can shine in dog sports such as obedience training, agility, and rally. The athletic, graceful IG seems built for agility, and many love the sport and do it well. What they don"t do well is housetraining. Like many small breeds, the IG can be difficult to housetrain, and some dogs are never completely trustworthy in the house. Aside from the occasional cleanup, life with an IG is both restful and zestful. He loves snuggling with his people for a while, then flying around the house and jumping on furniture and tabletops. IGs are catlike in their love of high places, and you"ll often find them perched on the backs of chairs, on windowsills, or any other high spot they can reach. Older IGs are more sedate and will cuddle with you on your recliner and just enjoy the day. On sunny days, expect to find your IG sunbathing in the yard, one of his favorite pastimes. He loves warmth and is fussy about getting cold or wet. It"s not unusual for IG owners to have a sheltered area in the yard so their dogs can go potty on rainy days without getting their feet wet. At night, he"ll burrow beneath the covers on your bed. Your IG will demand attention if he feels he"s being ignored. Privacy becomes a distant memory once you own an Italian Greyhound, because he"ll follow you everywhere at all times. He"s also curious and will investigate anything that catches his interest. The Italian Greyhound is one of those small dogs with a big personality. He"s affectionate, possessive, and loving, charming his way into your life. If you can give him the attention, exercise, and training he needs — not to mention tons of love — then the Italian Greyhound can make an elegant and loveable addition to your household.
Italian Greyhounds were bred to hunt and still have the hunting instinct. They"ll chase anything that moves, including cars, so when you"re outside keep them on leash or in a fenced area. This breed is sensitive to drugs such as anesthetics of the barbiturate class and organophosphate insecticides. Make sure your veterinarian is aware of these sensitivities, and avoid using organophosphate products to treat your home and yard for fleas. Italian Greyhound puppies are fearless and believe they can fly. Broken bones are common in pups between four and 12 months old, particularly the radius and ulna (the bones in the front legs). Although they"re clever, Italian Greyhounds have a short attention span and a "what"s in it for me?" attitude toward training. Keep training sessions short and positive, using play, treats, and praise to motivate your Italian Greyhound to learn. This breed can be extremely difficult to housetrain. Even if you follow a housetraining program religiously, your Italian Greyhound may never be totally trustworthy in the house. It helps to have a dog door, so your dog can come and go as he wishes. And if your dog gives you the signs that he needs to go outside, take him out that instant — they"re not good at holding it. Italian Greyhounds need lots of love and attention, and if they don"t get it, they"ll become shy or hyper. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Italian Greyhound is an old breed, and dogs like it may have been around for more than two millennia. Miniature greyhounds are seen in 2,000-year-old artifacts from what"s now modern-day Turkey and Greece, and archaeological digs have turned up small Greyhound skeletons. Although the breed"s original purpose has been lost to history, the Italian Greyhound may have served as a hunter of small game in addition to his duties as a companion. By the Middle Ages, the breed had made its way to southern Europe and was very popular among the aristocracy, especially in Italy — hence its name. Many Italian Greyhounds were immortalized, along with their owners, in portraits by famous artists such as Pisanello and Giotto di Bondone. In the 1600s the Italian Greyhound arrived in England, where, as in Italy, it found many fans among the nobility. Royal owners throughout the centuries include Mary, Queen of Scots, Princess Anne of Denmark, Charles I, Frederick the Great of Prussia, and Queen Victoria, during whose reign the breed"s popularity peaked. The American Kennel Club registered its first Italian Greyhound in 1886, and American breeders began to establish the breed in the United States. Although the American population of Italian Greyhounds was small, they may have helped save the breed from extinction. During World Wars I and II, when dog breeding became an unaffordable luxury for most people, the numbers of Italian Greyhounds in England dwindled dangerously low. Each time the wars ended, British breeders used those American-bred Italian Greyhounds to restore the breed in Europe. Today the Italian Greyhound is enjoying a second renaissance, as modern dog owners rediscover the elegant little hound who"s delighted his human companions for at least 2,000 years.
Italian Greyhounds stand 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 6 to 10 pounds, with some as large as 14 or 15 pounds.
The Italian Greyhound is sensitive, alert, smart, and playful. He"s affectionate with his family, and loves to snuggle with you and stick close to your side all day. Strangers may see a more shy, reserved side of his personality. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the IG needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your IG puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills. When treated harshly, the Italian Greyhound can become fearful or snappy. Like other hounds, he can have a "what"s in it for me?" attitude toward training, so you"ll do best with motivational methods that use play, treats, and praise to encourage the dog to get it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong.
IGs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all IGs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In IGs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications. Vitreous Degeneration: The vitreous is a clear jelly that is the single largest structure of the eye. A healthy vitreous is essential for normal vision. If the vitreous becomes cloudy, liquefies, or moves from its position, vision may become impaired or lost. The condition is believed to be inherited, but the exact method of inheritance is unknown. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, this condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Epilepsy: The Italian Greyhound can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with proper management of this hereditary disorder. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner. Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.
Italian Greyhounds (also known as IGs) have short coats and get the shivers easily, so they"re not an outdoor breed. They need to be inside the house with their family, especially in bad weather. To keep your IG comfortable on chilly outdoor walks, give him a sweater or jacket. During warm weather, protect his thin skin with sunscreen made for dogs. Many Italian Greyhounds develop skin cancer, possibly because they love lying in the sun, so don"t let your dog bake for hours. These little dogs have lots of energy, especially as puppies and young adults, but in their golden years they"ll often adapt to the activity level of their owners. A daily walk will help your Italian Greyhound get his ya-yas out, but make sure to keep him on a leash. Even though he"s small, he has the same instinct to chase as a larger sighthound and will take off after a squirrel, rabbit, or anything else that runs by. A leash is your only hope of hanging onto him. His hunting drive also means you"ll need a secure fence in your yard. Italian Greyhounds are fabulous jumpers, so don"t assume that a little four-foot wall is enough to keep him in. And don"t use an underground electronic fence; the momentary shock won"t deter your Italian Greyhound if he sees something he wants to chase. IGs are intelligent and easy to train if you have the right attitude. Like other hounds they usually approach training with a "What"s in it for me?" philosophy. Motivational training methods — those that use food, praise, and play to reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong — is the best way to persuade them that they want to do what you ask. And since they have the short attention spans common to sighthounds, it"s best to keep training sessions short and sweet. Like many small dogs, there"s one aspect of training they don"t pick up as easily: housetraining. Even with patience and consistency, you may never be completely successful. The number one reason people give up their Italian Greyhound to rescue groups or animal shelters is because they couldn"t housetrain them. Harsh punishment will backfire, often making the dog fearful or even snappy. Your best bet is to get a dog door, so he can go in and out at will. Italian Greyhounds can also learn to use a litter box, although this doesn"t always work well if you have more than one IG as you might end up cleaning it quite often. Prevent accidents by taking your IG outside the moment he gives you any signs that he needs to go — no waiting "just a minute." You can teach an Italian Greyhound that outdoors is the place to go potty, but if means going out in rain or snow, or if he doesn"t have immediate access to the yard, he"d just as soon go indoors.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality, high-calorie dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your IG in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your IG, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
An Italian Greyhound"s short coat looks glossy like satin and feels soft to the touch. You"ll find it in all shades of fawn, cream, red, blue, or black, either solid or with white markings. One of the benefits of living with an Italian Greyhound is that his coat doesn"t shed much and is easy to care for. All you really need to do is brush it when it gets dusty, and bathe the dog when he"s rolled in anything smelly — a favorite activity. Brush your IG"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your IG to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Italian Greyhounds can do well with children, but because they"re small and delicate, it"s especially important to teach kids that the dog is living animal, not a toy, who must be treated with love and respect. Many breeders will not sell a puppy to a household with children younger than ten years old. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Italian Greyhounds usually get along well with other pets, although you may need to keep an eye on them when they"re cavorting about with bigger dogs, who could accidentally hurt them while playing.
Italian Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many IGs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an IG rescue.

Once upon a time, hunting was a favorite pastime among men of property, including men of the church. We can thank one of those hard-hunting English parsons for the Jack Russell Terrier, developed to hunt fox in the south of England some 200 years ago. Parson John Russell, "Jack" to his friends, wanted an efficient hunting dog and decided to design exactly the dog he had in mind. The result was a bold, athletic dog who won hearts with his quickness, intelligence, determination, and intense desire to hunt. The Jack Russell Terrier, also called the Parson Russell Terrier, is a favorite among horse owners, dog sports enthusiasts, animal trainers for film and television, and people who simply appreciate his fearless personality, boundless energy, entertaining antics, and portable size. But beware! The trained Jack Russell that you see on TV or in movies doesn"t come that way. Teaching a Jack Russell to become a civilized companion is no easy task. It requires lots of time and patience as well as a strong sense of humor. The JRT is highly trainable, but he has a mind of his own and won"t stand for boredom. If you don"t keep him entertained, he"ll find his own amusements, and you probably won"t be happy with the results. If you want a dog who can learn tricks, run an agility or flyball course in seconds flat, play fetch until you drop, and who will make a charming companion when he"s not getting into mischief, the Jack Russell may be the dog for you. If you can"t deal with a dog who will chew, dig, and bark, rocket through the house multiple times daily, chase cats and other small animals with glee and murderous intent, and will always find the loophole in any command you give, he"s definitely not the dog for you, no matter how cute and small he is. If you have the time and patience to devote to him, the Jack Russell has many qualities that make him an ideal family dog. He"s devoted to his people and loves being with them. His heritage as a hunting dog makes him an excellent jogging companion once he"s full grown. Active older children will find him to be a happy and affectionate playmate, but his rambunctious nature can overwhelm younger kids. On the downside, his fearless nature frequently puts him in harm"s way. He has tons of energy and won"t be satisfied by a sedate walk around the block. This is a dog who loves to run and jump and fetch. Plan on giving him 30 to 45 minutes daily of vigorous exercise. He"s an escape artist who"s best suited to a home with a yard and a secure fence that can"t be climbed, dug under, or jumped over. An underground electronic fence won"t contain a JRT. The Jack"s strong prey drive makes him entirely untrustworthy off leash, so you"ll need snap on the leash when you"re outside of fenced areas. And his instinct to "go to ground" — to dig for prey — means your garden isn"t safe from excavation. A Jack Russell can fill your days with laughter and love, but only if you can provide him with the attention, training, supervision, and structure he needs. First-time or timid dog owners would do well to start with a less challenging pooch. Do yourself and the dog a favor by considering carefully whether this is the right breed for you. If it is, you"re in for a wild but wonderful ride.
The Jack Russell Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging and can make quite a large hole in a short time. It" easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area than it is to break him of a digging habit. Jack Russell Terriers must have a securely fenced yard to give them room to play and burn off their abundant energy. Underground electronic fencing won"t hold them. Jacks have been known to climb trees and even chain link fencing to escape their yards, so it"s best if their time outdoors is supervised. First-time or timid dog owners would do well to choose another kind of dog. The Jack can be a challenge even for an experienced dog owner. He"s strong willed and requires firm and consistent training. Jacks can be recreational barkers, so they"re not suited to apartment life. Aggression toward other dogs can be a serious problem with the Jack Russell Terrier if he"s not taught to get along with other canines from an early age. The Jack Russell thrives when he"s with his family and should not live outdoors or in a kennel. When you leave the house, try turning on a radio to help prevent separation anxiety. Jacks are bouncy and will jump up on people and things. They"re capable of jumping higher than 5 feet. Jack Russells have a strong prey drive and will take off after smaller animals. They should never be trusted off leash unless they"re in a fenced area. Jack Russell Terriers have a high energy level and are active indoors and out. They need several walks per day, or several good games in the yard. They make excellent jogging companions. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and breeds for sound temperaments.
The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in southern England during the mid-1800s by Parson John Russell, from whom the breed took its name. Russell aimed to create a working terrier who would hunt with hounds, bolting foxes from their dens so the hounds could chase them. The Jack Russell became a favorite of many sportsmen, especially those who hunted on horseback. The breed was known in the U.S. by the 1930s, and several breed clubs sprang up with different opinions concerning the Jack"s appearance, working ability, and whether he should compete in conformation shows or remain a working dog. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America maintains an independent registry and considers the Jack purely a hunting dog, but the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America (JRTCA) sought recognition by the American Kennel Club, which was granted in 2000. To differentiate it from the dogs registered by the JRTCA, the American Kennel Club renamed the breed, calling it the Parson Russell Terrier.
Jack Russells vary widely in size, because different types were used for different purposes and terrain. They range in height from 10 to 15 inches at the shoulder and weigh 13 to 17 pounds. Jack Russells who stand 10 to 12 inches and are longer than they are tall are known as Shorty Jacks. Shorty Jacks resemble Corgis or Dachshunds more than the taller, more balanced American Kennel Club-registered Parson Russell Terriers or the dogs registered by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America or the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America.
The energetic and spirited Jack packs a lot of personality into his small body. Loving, devoted, and endlessly amusing, he enjoys life and all it has to offer. Given half a chance, he"ll pursue his delights over fences and through the streets. He"s incredibly intelligent, but his wilful nature can make him difficult to train. Friendly toward people, he can be aggressive toward other dogs and any animal that resembles prey, including cats. His fearless nature puts him at risk when he decides to take on a bigger dog. He thrives on structure and routine, but training sessions should be short and sweet to hold his interest. Repetition bores him. A proper Jack is friendly and affectionate, never shy. Like every dog, Jack Russells need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Jack Russell puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Jack Russell Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Jacks will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Jack Russells, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America doesn"t register any dogs with hereditary defects; dogs must pass a specific veterinary exam before being registered. The following conditions may affect Jack Russell Terriers: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is generally a disease of small breeds. This condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward. Deafness is associated with white coat color and is sometimes seen in this breed. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Glaucoma is a painful disease in which pressure is abnormally high in the eye. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor. If the fluid doesn"t drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases. That high pressure causes damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, occurs when there is a problem in the area of the eye where fluid goes out. Secondary glaucoma is a result of some other problem in the eye, such as inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally only affects one eye first. Affected eyes will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won"t react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment. Treatment can be surgery or it can be treated with medicine, depending on the case. Lens Luxation causes the lens of the eye to become displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It"s sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.
The Jack Russell is a people lover who should live indoors with the family. It"s best if he has access to a fenced yard where he can burn off some of his abundant energy. The fence should be impossible for him to climb, dig under, or jump — think Fort Knox. And don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Jack in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey. Always walk your Jack on leash to prevent him from chasing other animals, challenging bigger dogs, or running in front of cars. Give him 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble. Faint heart never trained feisty Jack Russell. People who live with Jack Russells must be firm and consistent in what they expect. Jacks are strong-willed dogs, and although they respond to positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards, they"ll become stubborn in the face of harsh corrections. Provide your Jack Russell with rules and routines and apply the right amount of patience and motivation, however, and you"ll be well rewarded. There are no limits to what a Jack Russell can learn when he"s paired with the right person. Give your Jack plenty of positive interactions with other dogs beginning in puppyhood — early socialization is important to prevent aggression toward other dogs.  
Recommended daily amount: 1.25 to 1.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Jack Russell in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Jack Russell Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Parson Russell Terrier comes in two coat types: smooth and broken. Both types have a double coat with a coarse texture. The broken coat is slightly longer with just a hint of eyebrows and a beard. Some Jacks have what"s called a rough coat, which is longer than a broken coat. Whatever its type, the coat is never curly or wavy. Jacks can be white, white with black or tan markings, or tricolor (white, black, and tan). The white on the body helps the hunter see the dog in the field. Both coat types need only weekly brushing to remove dead and loose hair. If you brush your Jack faithfully, he should rarely need a bath. Broken or rough coats must be stripped once or twice a year. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Jack enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. The only other grooming care he needs is dental hygiene. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease, daily for best results. Start brushing and examining your Jack when he"s a puppy, to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Jack Russell Terriers are loving and affectionate dogs who can do well in homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. They"re not suitable for homes with young children. Besides being rambunctious, they can snap when roughly handled. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. Some Jacks are aggressive toward other dogs, especially dogs of the same sex. They have a strong prey drive and will chase (and kill, if given the chance) cats and other small animals.

Jumpin" jiminy! Is that a Japanese Chin on your fireplace mantel? It is! People who live with the Chin often marvel at the breed"s ability to leap tall furniture in a single bound. The toy-size Japanese Chin has a catlike nature that includes the desire to be in high places, the ability to climb, and the tendency to wash himself. He has also been seen batting at objects much like a cat would. Feline traits notwithstanding, the Japanese Chin has all of the qualities one looks for in a companion dog. He thrives when he"s with his people, and he loves everyone. Japanese Chin do well in apartments and will adapt to any living situation, but their tiny size and love of human companionship mean they"re not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel. Japanese Chin have the classic look of an Oriental breed with a large, broad head; large, wide-set eyes; and a flattish face. Small, V-shaped ears hang down, set just below the top of the head. They carry their plumed tail jauntily over their back. They have an abundant coat, but looks are deceiving. The Chin is a wash-and-go breed and needs little more than a weekly brushing to maintain his elegant appearance. With the occasional exception of the ear fringes, the coat rarely mats, and it doesn"t require any trimming. Intelligent and well mannered, the Japanese Chin learns quickly, but he has a mind of his own. If training becomes repetitive, he will choose to do something more entertaining. He can be difficult to housetrain, but if you"re persistent and consistent he"ll get the message. In general, the Japanese Chin is a happy dog who gets along with everyone. He"s friendly toward other dogs and cats and is a playful companion for older children. Because of his small size, however, he"s not suited to homes with young children, who might accidentally injure him. Chin are loving and devoted to their family, but they have a natural shyness around new people and new situations. It"s not unusual for them to be slightly aloof with strangers until they get to know them. The Japanese Chin requires little in the way of exercise and is a great companion to people who can"t get around easily. He enjoys a daily walk or play session but won"t become destructive if you just lie around eating bonbons and playing with him. Chin enjoy playing, and they move with such grace and agility that they rarely disturb anything when they race through a home. These are sensitive dogs. They pick up on the emotions of the home and their owners and will shape their personality to match. If he lives in a home that is quiet and somber, the Japanese Chin will become quiet and reserved, yet still possess all the wonderful traits of a companion dog. If he lives in an active home, he will generally be lively and outgoing. Fun-loving and charming, the Chin can be addictive. People who love him can"t imagine life without him, and many can"t imagine life without two or three.
The Japanese Chin is catlike in many ways. The breed is commonly seen grooming itself by licking its paws and wiping its head. Also, they enjoy being up high and will perch on the back of couches and on tables. Considered to be an average shedder, the Japanese Chin requires a few minutes of brushing each day to remove loose hair and to keep the coat from tangling. Japanese Chin do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overexert themselves. Due to the breed"s flat face, Japanese Chin will often snort, sniffle, or reverse sneeze. Generally, a Japanese Chin is still able to breathe through this, but if the attack becomes severe, you can try gently stroke his neck. Japanese Chin do well in apartments. Although Japanese Chin are intelligent and eager to please, they require interesting, fun-filled training sessions. Otherwise, they get bored and will turn their attention to something more entertaining. Japanese Chin do very well with older children but are not recommended for homes with smaller children due to their small size. They can be seriously injured with minimal force. Japanese Chin are companion dogs who thrive when they are with the people they love. They should not live outside or in a kennel away from their family. Japanese Chin require a lower amount of exercise compared to other breeds but they do enjoy a daily walk or play in the yard. Japanese Chin don"t like being parted from their people, and separation anxiety is a common problem in the breed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Japanese Chin is an ancient breed that probably originated in the Chinese imperial court. Highly prized, he was often given as a gift to emissaries from other lands, and it was probably as a gift to the emperor of Japan that he made his way to that island nation which gave him his name. In Japan, the Chin was regarded not as a dog (inu) but as a separate being (chin). There, he was probably crossed with small spaniel-type dogs and eventually achieved the look he has today. The Japanese Chin remained unknown to the outside world until 1853 when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Uraga Harbor near Edo — now modern-day Tokyo — and introduced Japan to international trade. The Japanese Chin became a popular commodity and many were imported into Britain and the United States. Among the first American owners of the breed were President Franklin Pierce, then-Secretary-of-War Jefferson Davis, and Perry"s daughter, Caroline Perry Belmont. They became popular with people of wealth and nobility. In the United States, the Japanese Chin was known as the Japanese Spaniel and he kept that name until 1977.
The Japanese Chin is sturdily built but with a refined appearance. He stands 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder and weighs between 4 and 9 pounds.
The personality of the Japanese Chin is a true indicator of the depth that these dogs possess. In general, he"s a happy and charming dog who is affectionate and intelligent. He"s talkative, but not barky. Chin people say their dogs like to "sing" and will chatter to announce the arrival of guests or strangers. Chin are so sensitive to their environments and the emotions of their people that they have been known to shape their personality around them. If he lives in a home that is quiet and somber, the Japanese Chin will become reserved. If he lives in an active home, he will do his part to keep the action lively. The Japanese Chin is always devoted to his people and may suffer from separation anxiety. He is a pleasant dog who shows love and affection to everyone in his life, but he can be shy when exposed to new people or situations.
Chin are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Chin will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chin, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Atrioventricular Endocardiosis: This degenerative disease affects the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart. It occurs when polysaccharide deposits distort the shape of the valves and cause them to leak. This can lead to heart failure. A change in diet and exercise may be necessary. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They"re an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and five being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Japanese Chin has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.
Japanese Chin require very little exercise. They are happy with a daily walk or a nice play session but they tend to require little else. Training can be slightly difficult since they have a mind of their own and become bored with repetitious training. When they like you, however, they"ll work hard to please you. When they do wrong, a firm tone of voice is all you need to set them straight. Stronger corrections will only backfire and cause your Chin to stubbornly stand his ground. They can be difficult to housetrain but with patience and consistency, you can generally expect them to be housetrained by 4 months of age. Japanese Chin are companion dogs and should not live outdoors or in kennels. They become very attached to their people, and many suffer from separation anxiety. With their low exercise needs, Japanese Chin make wonderful apartment residents. The neck of the Japanese Chin is very delicate and it is strongly suggested that you use a harness instead of a collar when walking him.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. It is important when you are feeding your Japanese Chin that use choose a food that is high in fiber. Japanese Chin can suffer from impacted anal glands when their diet lacks good dietary fiber. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Chin, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Japanese Chin has an abundant coat that"s silky to the touch. It"s moderately long with a thick mane, feathered ears, a plumed tail, feathering on the back of the front legs, and light feathering that resembles culottes on the rear legs. The head, face, and forelegs are covered with short hair. Japanese Chin can have coats that are black and white, red and white, or black and white with tan points. Japanese Chin are a very clean breed and do not require regular baths. Once a month is plenty. Dry shampoos will generally keep them looking and smelling great. You can also use a mild shampoo, towel them until they"re almost dry, brush the coat upward and outward with a pin brush, and voila! They"re good to go. Chin do shed, but weekly brushing will help keep the hair from flying around your house. A quick daily brushing with a pin brush will help keep hair from tangling. Brush your Japanese Chin"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Japanese Chin to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Although the Japanese Chin is a gentle dog, he is not recommended for homes where there are young children. He can be easily hurt by an overexuberant child. The breed does well with older children who understand how to properly handle a dog. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Japanese Chin get along well with other dogs and cats, but they must be protected from larger dogs who could accidentally injure them in play. A cat"s claws can injure their large eyes, so it"s important to make sure everyone plays nicely together.

The official history of the Jindo is up for debate since there is no written account. However, most experts agree that this breed has been in the Jindo province for many centuries. There is no proof of how the dog originated on the island of Jindo, though the most popular theory states that they may be descended from Mongolian dogs brought to Korea during the 1270 A.D. Mongol invasion. Despite the many theories, there is evidence that Jindos have existed in Korea for at least 1,500 years. In 1962, they were designated as the 53rd National Treasure. This status makes it difficult to export a purebred outside of South Korea, though the first of this breed appeared in the United States in the 1980s. Despite their rarity in the States, they became recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1998. The Jindo Dogs Guild of Korea is responsible for monitoring the entire Jindo population. Beginning in 2008, this organizations issues certificated to purebreds. The breed has been long known in Korea for its hunting abilities. A pack of well-trained Jindos is an invaluable resource to a hunter, who serves as the pack leaders. Jindos will prey on medium to large prey, sometimes independent of their owners. They also serve as great guard dogs, protecting their owners in case of attack. Due to these traits, the Jindo was appropriated by militaries, police departments, and even search and rescue teams. It was believed that their ferocity and high trainability would make them a reliable fit for search and rescue positions. Unfortunately, the opposite proved to be true. In 2009, Bak Nam-sun spoke in an interview on the unfit nature of Jindos for search and rescue teams. It turns out that the dogs’ loyalty to one single owner was too strong for the multiple handlers of search and rescue teams. Their hunting instincts also often interfered with the search missions. Similarly, Son Min Suk stated in 2010 that German Shepherds were better military dogs. Again, the Jindo’s loyalty to their first trainer or their original home proved to be too strong to be effective in a military setting. Later that year, the Los Angeles Police Department discovered the same issues after adopting four Jindos from South Korea; the dogs were too eager to please their first trainers and were easily distracted because of it. Nowadays, the Jindo is still highly respected and popular throughout Korea. Despite being unfit for military and police positions, these dogs still make loyal and intelligent pets to individuals and families alike.
The Jindo is notorious for being both loyal and intelligent. Their pack mentality lends itself to easy training and an eagerness to please. However, their intelligence leads them to demand respect before giving their unwavering loyalty to their owners. They can be stubborn in the early stages of training and require patience. Once respect has been earned, there are few breeds that surpass the loyalty of the Jindo. They are quick to train and can learn even the most complicated tricks and agility sequences with ease. One of the more challenging aspect of the Jindo is their need for socialization. Jindos are overall a gentle and loving breed, but they are wary of strangers. Their loyalty disposes them to be furiously protective which can present itself as aggression in poorly socialized dogs. Early socialization with other animals, children, and strangers will quickly ease this concern.

Jindos should be allowed indoors, close to their owners. They do not do well if relegated alone outside for long periods of time. They are loyal and intelligent and form deep bonds with humans based on mutual trust and respect. When left alone, they can get bored and lonely and may become destructive, especially at young ages. Due to their high intelligence, Jindos need patience during early training stages. They are quick to train once their stubbornness has been surpassed. Especially important to training is the need for early socialization. Jindos can show signs of aggression and suspicion towards strangers if not properly socialized at an early age.
Jindos have digestive tracks optimized for a carnivorous diet. As such, standard or cheap commercial dog food may not be the best choice for this breed. Foods high in corn are particularly bad for Jindos. A healthy and accessible option for Jindos include home-cooked meals with natural ingredients and special supplements. A good second choice is all-natural, high-quality, commercially produced foods. For more detailed information, or if you are unsure on what to buy, always check with your vet. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference, the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.
The Jindo is recognized by the UKC in six different colors: white, fawn, red, brindle, grey, black, and black and tan. The Jindo are naturally incredibly clean dogs. They have self-cleaning coats and do not need to be bathed frequently. They even groom themselves like cats. The downside of this is that they also shed profusely, especially in hot weather with their double coat.  These dogs have no special grooming needs, making them fairly low maintenance in this department.
Jindos need to be socialized early if they will be exposed to children and other pets. While the Jindo are not known for being aggressive, they have been called an especially suspicious breed. They are fiercely protective of their owners, frequently to whatever ends they feel necessary. Coupled with a prey instinct, careful and patient training is a must for the social Jindo. At the same time, a properly socialized Jindo becomes very confident, gentle, and tolerant. While they are still independent and do not appreciate being challenged, with proper training they will not respond with aggression or violence. If you are unsure of how to properly train your Jindo, or want a helping hand, consider professional obedience training around six months of age.

The Keeshond (pronounced KAYZ-hawnd) is a medium-sized dog with an impressive gray, black, and cream coat and a massive, plumed tail. He was known for years as the "Dutch Barge Dog" because of his role as companion and guardian on barges and small boats on Holland"s many canals and rivers. While the Keeshond will issue a stern bark when someone approaches his property, he"s such a love that he"ll readily accept anyone his owner brings into the household. In truth, he isn"t a very effective guard dog. The Keeshond is a fan of cool weather. He likes spending time outside when the weather is crisp. However, he isn"t a backyard dog; he"s too people-oriented for that. He needs to live inside with his family and participate in all their activities. The Keeshond loves children and plays nicely with them (although, of course, adults should always supervise interactions between kids and any dog). The Keeshond also gets along well other dogs and pets if he is introduced to them at a young age. Besides being an excellent family pet, today"s Keeshond can strut his stuff in the conformation ring, obedience ring, and rally competition. He"s also sure-footed, which makes him a great agility competitor.
The Keeshond is never reluctant to issue a warning bark to alert his family to strangers. His propensity to bark can be a problem if he"s left alone too much and becomes bored. The best way to make a Keeshond miserable is to keep him separated from his family. He was bred to be a companion, and he needs to be part of family life. If you don"t want a dog joining in family barbeques, card games, or movie time, consider a more independent breed. Keeping the Keeshond coat in good condition isn"t terribly difficult, but the breed does shed like crazy once or twice or year. Luckily, frequent bathing isn"t usually needed — the Keeshond scores low on doggie odor. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Keeshond is a close cousin to the Samoyed, Chow, Norwegian Elkhound, Finnish Spitz, and Pomeranian. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Keeshond was a companion and watchdog on small vessels called rijnaken on the Rhine River. The Keeshond became the best-loved dog of Holland during a time of political unrest. Holland was divided into two factions: the prinsgezinden, or followers of the Prince of Orange, and the patriotten, or patriots. The patriots were led by one Cornelius de Gyselaer, who had a spitz-type dog named Kees as his constant companion. De Gyselaer"s followers were derisively referred to as Keezen by the opposing Orange party. The Keeshond became a symbol of the rebel party, and the breed became popular among ordinary people. In time, the followers of the Prince of Orange overthrew the rebel party and the Keeshond fell into disfavor as the representative of a lost cause; many dogs were destroyed. Some survived on Dutch farms and on barges around Amsterdam. The breed was rediscovered in 1905 by a Miss Hamilton-Fletcher (later to become Mrs. Wingfield-Digby). She convinced her parents to take home two puppies. These dogs were taken to England and became the foundation stock for the breed"s introduction outside of Holland. Mrs. Wingfield-Digby and Mrs. Alice Gatacre aroused interest in the breed in England and, in 1926, the English breed club was formed. The decline of the Keeshond in Holland continued until 1920, when Baroness van Hardenbroek became interested in the breed. The Baroness found that the dogs were still kept by riverboat captains, farmers, and working people. She began breeding Keeshonds and spread their story throughout Europe. Within 10 years, the Dutch Keeshond Club was formed. The first American litter of Keeshonds was bred in 1929 by Carl Hinderer. The first Keeshond was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1930 in the Non-Sporting Group, and the Keeshond Club of America was formed in 1935.
Males stand 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 45 pounds. Females stand 17 inches tall and weigh approximately 35 pounds.
The Keeshond was bred more to be a companion than a watchdog. He"s not a hunter, nor does he have an innate desire for any special job. He is, first and foremost, a devoted friend. He"s also intelligent and highly trainable. He"s so smart, in fact, that he can be a little mischievous. Expect the unexpected with these fellows. Despite this, the breed easily learns proper canine manners and can do well in the obedience ring. A Keeshond is a lively, alert dog, full of personality. When he"s excited or happy, he likes to share his joy with everyone, often spinning in circles. His outgoing personality, as well as his love of adults and children alike, endears him to all. As with every dog, the Keeshond needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Keeshond puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Keeshonds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Keeshonds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this is an extremely serious condition caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones. Most affected dogs have a poor appetite, vomit, and are lethargic. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are "hungry" even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try and compensate, but he"ll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Keeshond is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Keeshonds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
Having been bred first for life on a barge and later as a companion dog, the Keeshond has learned how to be happy in a relatively small space. He can live cheerfully in an apartment, a home with a large yard, or on a boat. More important than space is the Keeshond"s need to live in the house with his family. Because he"s a companion breed, it"s essential that he be allowed to share as many aspects of his owners" lives as possible. If left unattended in the yard for hours on end, with little or no contact with his family, he"ll become bored and his natural propensity to bark will intensify. He can become a nuisance barker if allowed. If you don"t plan on spending quality family time with your Keeshond in the house on a daily basis, you should consider a different breed. While every dog benefits from exercise, the Keeshond does not require a great deal of it. He isn"t generally considered to be the breed of choice for long-distance runners, for example. For your own health as well his, though, plan on at least one vigorous daily walk. The Keeshond is not fond of hot climates; he"s happiest and most comfortable in cool weather. On hot days, keep him inside in an air-conditioned house or near fans. Some Keeshonds will also enjoy lounging in a small children"s wading pool filled with cool water.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Keeshond in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Keeshond, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Keeshond look is fabulous, with his thick, double top coat, woolly undercoat, and a longer outer (or guard) coat. His mane is more profuse in males than in females. His hindquarters have "trousers," longer hair down to the hocks. His tail is like a plume set on a lady"s hat. The Keeshond color is a combination of cream, black, and gray. He has unique facial markings that seem to form spectacles, with a delicate, dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the ear. Surprisingly, the Keeshond"s full coat is relatively easy to maintain. Matting isn"t a severe problem, as long as you brush him at least twice a week. He does shed profusely twice a year, when he "blows" or sheds his entire undercoat all at once. This shedding period can be intense and can last for three weeks. Keeshonds are relatively clean dogs; their doggie odor is minimal. Bathing is necessary about every three months or so (more often, of course, if he rolls in something smelly or plays in mud). Given the breed"s heavy coat and intolerance to heat, you might think it"s wise to shave down the coat in the summer. Not so — the coat actually insulates, keeping the Keeshond cool and protecting him from sunburn. Brush, don"t shave. Trim his nails once a month, and his ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Keeshond"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Keeshond to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Keeshond is a great pet for families with children. He"s a playful, good-natured companion for kids of all ages. And as long as he is well socialized and well trained, the Keeshond gets along well with other dogs and pets. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
Consider adopting a Keeshond from a rescue group before going to a breeder. The Keeshond Club of America

This working-class dog is definitely all terrier: alert, resourceful, muscular, and always ready for action. His defining characteristic, however, is his coat: blue, with a gray tint (though it doesn"t start out that way). Puppies are often born black, transitioning through dark blue, brown, gray, and combinations of these colors until they reach a mature blue-gray color at about 18 months of age. His V-shaped ears, black nose, and the mop of hair that falls over his eyes further distinguish his look. The Kerry Blue Terrier is typically good-natured with people of all ages, including children. He is an excellent family dog who enjoys participating in all family activities and he is happiest when he is with those he loves. He makes a good watchdog too, ready to warn his family of intruders or anything out of the ordinary. The Kerry Blue is not especially vocal, but when he barks, he sounds intimidating. The Kerry Blue is not especially good-natured with other dogs. In fact, he is prone to dog aggression (fighting with other dogs), especially if he"s intact. Early Kerry Blue Terriers were even more aggressive than those found today. Conscientious breeders have worked hard to retain the liveliness of the breed while toning down their natural inclination to aggression. Good breeding, combined with proper socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people) and training, helps prevent dog aggression, but watch out. This is not a dog to back down from a fight. The Kerry Blue is loyal and affectionate toward his family, but he is strong willed. He needs an equally strong-willed owner, one who can kindly and consistently show leadership. The Kerry Blue will walk all over a wishy-washy human, which is why he is not always recommended for first-time dog owners. Not surprisingly, the working Kerry Blue is an active dog who needs a great deal of exercise every day. (If he is trained and socialized not to fight with other dogs, he makes an excellent jogging, hiking, and bicycling companion.) Grooming is another daily activity. Although the Kerry Blue doesn"t shed and is relatively odor-free, he must be brushed every day to prevent matting and to keep his coat neat and clean. It"s not difficult to be captivated by this proud dog from Ireland with the blue-gray coat. However, in considering a Kerry Blue, it"s important to realize he has many traits similar to all terriers: the love of digging, a bit of an attitude, and a high prey drive. These traits must be taken in account when considering adding him to the family.
The Kerry Blue Terry is a quick study, though he can be strong willed at times. You"ll need a lot of patience and firmness, plus a good sense of humor, when training this breed. The Kerry Blue is friendly to people, but his distaste for other dogs is well known. He can be aggressive and quarrelsome. Owners must be vigilant when taking the Kerry Blue in public. If he"s socialized and well trained, he probably won"t pick a fight, but he might try to end it if he"s taunted. Keeping your Kerry Blue groomed is expensive and, if you do it yourself, it"s hard work. Like all terriers, the Kerry Blue can be feisty. He loves to dig, chase, chew, and sometimes bark. This is an active breed. He needs plenty of exercise, every day. A yard to play in is best, combined with daily walks. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Ireland — specifically, the mountainous area of County Kerry — is the birthplace of the Kerry Blue Terrier. He was originally a working terrier, hunting small game and birds, killing rodents, and guarding his homestead. He was used successfully for herding sheep and cattle. Eventually, the breed was shown in conformation and highly favored. English fanciers saw potential, too, and the breed was recognized by the Kennel Club. Aggressiveness was originally was bred into the Kerry Blues intentionally. In early dog shows, the Irish Kennel Club required each to pass a "gameness" test before he could be judged. The tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay. From these tests, the Kerry Blue earned the nickname "Blue Devil." No one really knows who brought the first Kerry Blue to the United States. He was thought to have appeared at the Westminster show in 1922, and the breed was officially recognized by the Amercian Kennel Club in 1924. During the Westminster show of 1926, a group of fanciers met at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City and organized the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America. In the early 1900s, Irish patriot Michael Collins introduced legislation to name the Kerry Blue the National Dog of Ireland. His own Kerry Blue was named Convict 225. Collins was murdered, however, before the legislation could be passed, and after his death, interest in the initiative was lost.
Males stand 18 to 19.5 inches tall. Females stand 17.5 to 19 inches tall. Males and females weigh 33 to 40 pounds.
The Kerry Blue is a hard-working, independent, and athletic dog with plenty of energy and stamina. Like most terriers, he is prone to dig, chase, and bark (occasionally). If you are considering a Kerry Blue, think about whether or not you are willing to live with his propensity toward these behaviors. If so, you will be delighted with the Kerry Blue"s fun-loving, even silly, attitude. The Kerry Blue is an active breed, and he needs plenty of exercise — mental and physical. Don"t leave him alone for long periods of time, or he is likely to become bored, which leads to the destructive behaviors mentioned above. Training is essential to teach him proper canine manners. And as delightful as he is, the Kerry Blue does not get along well with others. He tends to fight with other dogs and chase small animals he perceives as prey. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Kerry Blue needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Kerry Blue puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Kerry Blue are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kerry Blue will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Kerry Blue, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Skin Cysts: It"s not unusual for the Kerry Blue to develop lumps and bumps, usually epidermal cysts or sebaceous gland cysts that don"t cause a problem. If a cyst ruptures, however, it can become infected. Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications. Keratoses: Keratoses (of the nose and foot) is the development of corns, warts, and calluses on the feet or nose. Often painful, corns can be inherited and are associated with thin pads or flat feet. Keratoses can be removed surgically or treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids. Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Kerry Blues and can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care. Chronic Otitis Externa: This is a chronic infection of the outer ear canal, often caused by excessive hair in the ear that fosters bacterial and fungal growth. The Kerry Blue can be prone to infection. Treatment includes cleaning the ears and plucking the hair growing inside the canal. Progressive Neuronal Abiotrophy (PNA): This is a rare, inherited nerve disorder. Symptoms usually appear when the dog is between 2 and 6 months of age. By the time the dog is a year old, he can"t stand up. There is no treatment, nor are there any tests that determine if breeding dogs are carriers of the condition. Research is underway to create testing for breeding stock. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Factor Xl Deficiency (Plasma Thromboplastin Antecedent Deficiency): This is a rare inherited blood clotting abnormality that is characterized by severe bleeding after surgery or trauma. As the name implies, it"s caused by a deficiency of the factor XI in the blood-clotting mechanism.
The Kerry Blue Terrier is a powerful, agile, and athletic dog who requires regular exercise. While some Kerry Blues will exercise themselves in a securely fenced back yard, others do not. Not only will a daily walk maintain muscle tone and keep a Kerry fit and trim, it will provide the necessary stimulation and socialization to keep him mentally alert. The Kerry Blue who lives in an apartment or condo requires at least three daily walks, even if it"s raining or the temperature is below freezing. Training and socialization is essential for the Kerry Blue, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Kerry Blue with you to many different places — the pet supply store, outdoor events, or long walks in busy parks — anywhere there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see. Remember, though, that he has a tendency to quarrel with other dogs. Also: if you don"t have children, but may in the next few years, the Kerry Blue must be socialized early to them. The Kerry has a mind of his own and requires a firm but loving hand to show what is expected from him. He instinctively wants to please, and with positive reinforcement and praise, learns quickly. Harsher techniques aren"t useful with a Kerry, because despite his toughness, he is surprisingly sensitive.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Kerry Blue in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Kerry Blue, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Kerry Blue coat is soft, dense and wavy, and though considered non-shedding, the coat is high maintenance. He needs daily brushing, plus trimming and bathing every four to six weeks. Most owners opt to hire a professional groomer to trim the Kerry Blue, though finding one who knows the correct Kerry trim can be difficult. An uncommon breed, the average groomer doesn"t have much experience with it; you might end up with your Kerry Blue looking like a Schnauzer or a Poodle. Your best option is to choose a groomer who certified with a national certifying agency. While certification is not mandated legally (like kennel licensing), it does show ongoing education. Also, owners can find a state-by-state listing of experienced groomers at The Kerry Blue Foundation website. Brush your Kerry Blue"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Kerry Blue to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Kerry Blue loves kids, and because he is a sturdy dog, he can take a few knocks if the play gets rough. He is good-natured, and isn"t normally grouchy with children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He is grouchy, even aggressive, with other dogs, though with socialization and training — and altering — this tendency can be minimized. Never let your guard down, though, when the Kerry Blue is around other dogs, especially those unfamiliar to him. The Kerry Blue isn"t especially fond of small animals either, given his strong prey drive. His instinct tells him to chase, so keep him leashed in public. The best way to ensure he"ll get along with cats or small mammals in his home is to raise him with them and introduce them properly. Following that, close supervision is advised.

The Komondor may look like a mop on four legs, but beneath all that hair, there"s a big dog with a big personality. Originally bred to guard livestock — a job he still excels at — the Komondor is intelligent, independent, and highly protective. In fact, he enjoys nothing more than watching over his family. This may pose a couple of problems. For one, it can be unnerving to have a dog sit and stare at you as you go about your day. For another, the Komondor"s protective instincts and suspicion of strangers can lead to trouble (and lawsuits) if your dog attacks someone he perceives as a threat. Obviously, this dog comes with responsibilities. You need to be a confident leader to win the respect of your Komondor. The meek, and the inexperienced dog owner, need not apply. You"ll have to socialize your Komondor well — exposing him to lots of different people, situations, and other animals — from an early age so he knows how to behave around them. And you"ll have to take pains to introduce your Komondor to people who are permitted in your home. Once a Komondor accepts the newcomer, he"ll always remember him and treat him as a member of his flock, one more person to watch over. You"ll also need to be careful around other dogs. Komondorok can be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know, and some aren"t capable of sharing a home with another canine, no matter how hard you to try to make everyone get along. However, they may have excellent relations with cats and livestock. Nor is the Komondor"s coat care an easy proposition. Their trademark cords don"t need brushing, but they must be kept free of parasites and dirt. And if it gets damp, the Komondor"s coat can develop an unpleasant mildew odor. True to his working dog heritage, the Komondor is a smart cookie who learns quickly with the right trainer — that is, one who engages his mind and works with his independent nature rather than against it. With repetitive training techniques, he gets bored. The Komondor will ignore commands that seem unnecessary, so pick your battles. The Komondor comes with lots of benefits in addition to the responsibilities. This loyal breed will happily spend his days under or on your feet, serving as companion, friend, and guardian.
Komondor are rare, but unethical backyard breeders and puppy mills do breed them. It"s important to find a good breeder to make sure you don"t get a puppy who will develop health or behavior problems. Although an apartment or condo is not the ideal living space for a Komondor, he can adjust to that lifestyle if he receives daily exercise and is trained not to bark excessively. This strong-willed dog needs a confident owner who can provide leadership the Komondor will respect. This isn"t a good choice for the first-time dog owner. Although Komondor shouldn"t be brushed, their coat needs extensive care to keep its white color and to stay free of dirt, debris, and parasites. If you want your Komondor"s coat to stay clean, he should sleep indoors. Komondor are barkers and suspicious of most things they see or hear. The breed is an excellent watch dog for both home and livestock and was originally developed for this role. Komondor can be aggressive to other dogs. Komondor aren"t high-energy, and are happy just watching and following you around the house. But they still need daily exercise of at least a few walks per day to keep them healthy and at their proper weight. A high fence is required to prevent the Komondor from attempting to expand his territory, a common habit of guard dogs. The Komondor is happiest when he"s working. He"s ideal for guarding livestock, but any job will give him the mental exercise he needs. Although Komondor historically spent their time outside protecting the flock, they do need time inside with their family. Like any dog, a Komondor can become aggressive, fearful, or aloof when deprived of human company.
The earliest written description of the Komondor dates back to the 16th century, but the breed was around long before that, guarding livestock herds in his native Hungary. The Komondor is believed to be descended from the Russian Owtcharka, another breed of sheepdog. Komondor had a special advantage in their job. With their white, corded coats, they closely resembled their flocks — large sheep with white, curly wool — and were able to mingle with them unseen by predators until it was too late. As with many breeds, World War II left the Komondor on the brink of extinction. After the war, fanciers tried to return the breed to its original numbers, but it remained rare and largely unknown. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1937, but there were few Komondor outside Hungary until after 1962. The Komondor ranks 144th in popularity among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club. He still serves as a livestock guardian, but he"s now known as a companion dog as well.
The Komondor male stands 27.5 inches tall and up and weighs 100 or more pounds; a female is 25.5 tall and weighs 80 or more pounds.
Komondor puppies take a long time to reach maturity — generally three years or so — but when they do, they have a calm, devoted personality. They"re intelligent, independent, and fiercely protective, willing to rise to the challenge of defending home and family. Komondor are wary of strangers and can be aggressive to other dogs. These traits, plus their large size, make them a bad match for first-time or timid owners. Komondor need early and extensive socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — starting in early puppyhood. Enrolling your Komondor in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Keep up his socialization by continually exposing him to lots of different people. Invite visitors over regularly and take him along on outings and walks.
Komondor are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Komondor will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Komondor, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or PennHIP clearances for hips. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. Hip Dysplasia: This degenerative disease occurs when the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development and is found in many breeds of dogs. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Komondor has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically when the dog reaches maturity. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated.
When he"s young, this intelligent breed is surprisingly easy to train. That ease is often short lived, however, and turns into frustration when the apt pupil turns into a stubborn student. Komondor are independent as well as smart. The key to training a Komondor is not force or repetition, but making training fun for both owner and dog. The Komondor"s ability to think for himself will lead him to decide that some commands are worth learning, some aren"t worth repeating, and some are okay only once in a while. He becomes bored easily, so make each training session different. Komondor have moderate exercise needs and are satisfied with two or three short walks daily or playtime in the yard. They need a securely fenced yard to help them define their territory and, because they"re so protective, to prevent other people and animals from entering that territory.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Komondor are prone to bloat, a potentially life-threatening condition. To help prevent bloat, feed two or three small meals daily rather than one large meal. To keep a Komondor"s weight at a normal level, feed him at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your Komondor will be just as happy to get a fingernail-sized training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Komondor, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Komondor has a wonderfully unique coat. During puppyhood, he has soft curls that grow heavy as he matures, developing into long, feltlike cords that resemble the strands of a mop. The undercoat is soft and woolly, the topcoat coarse. Puppies have a cream or buff shading to their coats, but this color fades to white as they grow up. The Komondor coat doesn"t need brushing, but it"s definitely not maintenance-free. When the cords begin forming at eight to 12 months of age — a process in which the soft undercoat is trapped by the topcoat — it"s essential to keep the hair clean and dry so it doesn"t get dirty and discolored. The cords may not completely form until the dog is 2 years old. The cords must be separated regularly to prevent matting and to remove debris or dirt. Trimming around the mouth is suggested to avoid staining from food. And bathing and drying a Komondor is an all-day affair. Floor fans are excellent for post-bath drying, and many Komondorok will laze around in front of a fan. The coat can be trimmed short for ease of maintenance, although this takes away from the breed"s distinctive appearance. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Komondor"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Komondor jumps up to greet you. Start getting your Komondor used to being examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Komondor can be good companions to children in their own family, but may have difficulty accepting visiting children. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always supervise Komondor when they"re with children, and never leave them alone with young children. They"re livestock guardians, not babysitters. Even when exposed to them often, Komondor are generally not fond of other dogs. They do best in a single-dog home but can learn to get along with cats. They"re always pleased to have livestock to guard. That is, after all, their purpose in life.
Sometimes Komondorok are acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs may end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Contact rescue organizations for more information about available dogs and adoption requirements. Komondor Club of America Rescue

No, the name doesn"t translate to cookie dog, although he no doubt enjoys them as much as any other breed. Originating in the Netherlands, this cheerful spaniel appears in paintings dating back to the sixteenth century. He served as a hunting dog, luring ducks within range so they can be shot or tagged, much like the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. In fact, the Kooiker is thought to be the ancestor of the Toller. Friendly, good-natured, and alert, the Kooiker is an excellent family companion with watch dog skills as well as athletic ability that makes him a natural at games such as agility and flyball. As a retriever, he also loves playing fetch, especially in the water. His exercise needs are adaptable: A long, slow stroll around the block or a strenuous hike will suit him equally well. Just be sure he"s conditioned first before you start him on any heavy exercise. Introduce the Kooiker to cats or other dogs when he"s young and he"ll get along fine with them. Expect him to be reserved toward strangers but eagerly welcoming of friends and family. The Kooiker is smart and willing to learn, so take advantage of those traits and begin training early.

The Kuvasz (pronounced KOO-vahss; the plural is Kuvaszok, pronounced KOO-vah-sock) is probably the oldest of the three ancient Hungarian breeds. He has a regal bearing and a history (which includes an association with Count Dracula himself) as complex as his personality. His almond-shaped eyes, black nose, and dense white fur make him an eye-catching breed. So does his size. Males can weigh up to 115 pounds or even more. They"re sturdy and well-muscled, very strong with great endurance, yet elegant. Many think the Kuvasz moves like a wolf, with a powerful, graceful stride. When he trots or runs, he seems to glide, with little up-and-down movement of the body. Because his gait is so effortless, he"s capable of trotting for 15 miles or more without tiring. A Kuvasz"s white coat is beautiful to behold, and has at times contributed to the breed"s popularity as a "fashion dog." But they were bred to have white coats for reasons other than beauty: Their color helped shepards distinguish their dogs from wolves. The Kuvasz can be a wonderful, loyal, and patient companion, but he"s not for everyone. Because he was bred to guard, he can be aloof, independent, and suspicious of strangers. Your Kuvasz will be polite to welcomed guests, but no more — regardless of how hard the strangers try to befriend him. His almost fanatical loyalty makes him very protective; he"s always alert for any signs of danger, and when aroused, he can move with surprising speed given his size. Kuvaszok are extremely intelligent, but they aren"t easy to train. Their fierce independence makes them a challenge even for experienced dog owners. Puppies are playful well into adolescence, but older dogs usually are calm and reserved. Excessive barking, however, can be a problem at any age, depending on the individual dog. Because they"re so intelligent, protective, and strong, it"s especially important to socialize and train your Kuvasz starting at a young age. In true working dog spirit, Kuvaszok like to have a job to do, whether it"s watching over livestock or watching over your children. They"re typically gentle with kids and love to play with them. Mature dogs seem to understand their great strength, but Kuvaszok puppies, like children, often don"t know their limits, so you should always supervise the play of puppies and children. Kuvaszok are active dogs who wouldn"t do well in an apartment or house without a yard. If kept in a kennel or, worse, tethered or chained, they can become aggressive. Kuvaszok are determined and have a high tolerance to pain, so an underground electronic fence probably wouldn"t hold them if they really wanted to run free. But you shouldn"t always keep them outdoors. Let them inside so they can be with their family. Everyone will enjoy it.
Kuvaszok require a confident, experienced owner, one who gains their respect and understands their independent nature. Kuvaszok shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Brushing them at least once a week, and preferably every two to three days, is recommended. Like many large dogs, the Kuvasz may develop joint problems if exercised too much while he"s still growing. Don"t push your Kuvasz to over-exercise, jump excessively, or go up and down stairs too often until he"s passed his second birthday. Kuvaszok are suspicious of strangers and can be overly protective. Obedience training is imperative when you own a large guarding dog such as a Kuvasz. Although he"s pretty self-sufficient, a Kuvasz doesn"t like to be kept apart from his family. Like all dogs, he does best spending at least part of his time with you in the house rather than being left alone in the backyard. There really is no such thing as a "good backyard dog." Your Kuvasz can become aggressive and frustrated if kenneled, tethered, or chained. This is a breed that needs to run. He needs a large, fenced yard as well as a long daily walk or run once he"s physically mature. Kuvaszok are intelligent and like many guarding dogs, they think for themselves. Training can be difficult and requires a lot of patience, time, and consistency. Although they"re very gentle with children if they were raised with them, Kuvaszok puppies can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock over a small child. Your Kuvasz may consider any children other than the kids in your family to be threats. Opt to be safe rather than sorry, and when other kids come over to play, watch your Kuvasz carefully or put him in a secure area. Never allow anyone to reprimand your Kuvasz. If he feels that the person who"s reprimanding him isn"t "worthy" to do so, he will resent it.
The Kuvasz is perhaps the oldest of the three ancient dog breeds of Hungary, the other two being the Puli and the Komondor. They may have arrived with the Magyar tribes who invaded Hungary some 1,200 years ago, and one Hungarian dog historian posits that they were there many centuries earlier. The name Kuvasz is said to be a corruption of the Turkish word kawasz, meaning bodyguard. Another theory suggests that it comes from a Sumerian word, ku assa, referring to a dog that guarded and ran alongside horses and horsemen. Whatever their origin, by the 15th century, Kuvaszok were highly prized in Hungary as guard dogs, especially by King Matthias. Matthias was crowned on March 29, 1464 when he was just 15 years old. Despite his youth, Matthias was a shrewd and wise military leader. He built a large army of mercenaries that was able to beat back the Ottomans and expand the holdings of the Kingdom of Hungary. As might be expected in such turbulent times, palace intrigue was rampant. Plots and assassination attempts were commonplace. It was a time when a king couldn"t even trust his own family, but Matthias felt secure so long as his Kuvaszok were close by. It"s said that he took a brace of Kuvaszok with him wherever he went, even to his sleeping chambers. Matthias built huge kennels, housing hundreds of Kuvaszok on his estate at Siebenbuergen. In addition to protecting the king, these dogs were used to guard the estate"s livestock and sometimes to hunt large game, such as bear and wolves. The Kuvaszok were highly prized, and sometimes King Matthias would give a puppy to a visiting noble. Because they were associated with royalty, Kuvaszok became very popular. One noble who received such a gift was Vlad Dracula, the Prince of Wallachia. Vlad (also known as Vlad the Impaler, after his preferred method of torture) was a vassal of King Matthias at different times. At one point, King Matthias imprisoned Vlad in a royal tower for many years. Vlad worked his way back into the good graces of the king, and after his release, reportedly married a member of the royal family — probably a cousin of King Matthias. As a wedding gift, the king reportedly gave Vlad Dracula and his bride two Kuvaszok. After King Matthias died, the breed declined in popularity among royal and noble families, but continued his traditional role of protecting livestock for farmers and horsemen. In the late 1800s, breeders took an interest in standardizing the breed. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Kuvasz became the most fashionable large dog in Hungary and western Europe. During World War II, however, like many breeds, the Kuvasz nearly went extinct. Food shortages took their toll, and many kennels cut back or stopped breeding. When Nazi, then Soviet, soldiers moved through Hungary, brave Kuvaszok were often shot trying to protect their families and livestock. Some officers took Kuvaszok home with them, but even so, the breed was nearly wiped out. By the end of the war, there were fewer than 30 Kuvazok to be found in Hungary. Many Kuvasz fanciers were dead. The Russians who occupied Hungary looked upon dog breeding as a luxury hobby of aristocrats and punished breeders. Despite these hardships, breeders met in secret, selling puppies and dogs for cigarettes and food. But because food was still in short supply, Kuvaszok, like other large breeds with hearty appetites, were not popular. Since the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, conditions have steadily improved in Hungary and the Kuvasz has begun to regain his popularity. Today, there are active Kuvasz breed clubs scattered throughout Europe. It has been a struggle, however, because the near extinction left a very small gene pool from which to rebuild the breed, forcing some breeders to use other dogs, such as Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs. Kuvasz were first shown at a dog show in 1883 when Count d"Esterházy, a strong supporter of the breed, displayed two Kuvaszok in Vienna. In 1884, the first Hungarian standard for the breed was written. In 1931, the first Kuvasz was registered in the U.S. The Kuvasz Club of America (KCA) was established in 1966, and granted status as the official breed club in America by the American Kennel Club in 1993. Today, the breed ranks 134th in popularity among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males are usually 28 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 to 115 pounds. Females are 26 to 28 inches tall and weigh 70 to 90 pounds.
The Kuvasz is a spirited dog of keen intelligence, determination, courage, and curiosity, sensitive to praise and blame. He"s devoted to protecting his family, especially children, and is suspicious of strangers. If a family member appears to be in danger, he acts on his own initiative. Adult Kuvaszok are gentle and patient with children, but puppies can be too rambunctious for young kids. This is a bold and independent dog who needs confident, patient training. This isn"t the breed for a first-time or timid dog owner.
Kuvaszok are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kuvaszok will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Kuvaszok, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip and elbow dysplasia (with a score of fair or better) and hypothyroidism. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than two years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old. The following conditions may affect Kuvaszok: Canine hip dysplasia: This is a condition where the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by using the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn"t be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. There are many new treatments that can help your dog if hip dysplasia is found. Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD): This is a degeneration of bone that lies beneath the cartilage layer of joints. It"s often seen in young, fast-growing dogs of the larger breeds. X-rays often are inconclusive. OCD usually appears during the growth phase of a young dog (six to nine months of age) and can affect the shoulder, ankle, or elbow joint. Because it is painful, the dog limps. Jumping off furniture and being overweight can contribute to the problem. Your vet may recommend complete rest and limited play for several weeks or surgery to remove torn cartilage pieces. von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease lead normal lives. Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Kuvaszok, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, or exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised food dishes and certain types of food might also be factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.
Kuvaszok are active dogs who need a lot of exercise, and they"re not suited to apartments or homes without access to a large, fenced yard. Even with a yard, they need exercise such as long walks or runs once they"re physically mature. When left alone for long stretches, they can become destructive or aggressive. Because of their dense coats, Kuvaszok can stay outdoors in temperate to cold climates so long as they have shelter, water, and food. Like any dog, however, they also need access to the house, so they can be close to their family. Warm weather and high humidity make them uncomfortable.
Recommended daily amount: 2.75 to 3.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Kuvasz in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Kuvasz, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The dense white coat of the Kuvasz can grow to six inches in length. Expect to brush your Kuvasz a couple of times a week to prevent mats from forming, using a grooming rake, slicker brush, or pin brush. If your Kuvasz gets matted, use a large-toothed comb and a conditioning spray, along with your fingers, to gently work the mat loose. Kuvaszok shed heavily in the spring and the fall, and need more frequent brushing during these times. Unless he"s sick or has been rolling in something smelly, the Kuvasz coat is odorless and repels dirt and water, so you won"t need to bathe him often. In fact, bathing him too frequently could strip his coat of its natural protective oils, causing him to get dirty faster. Many Kuvasz owners clean their dogs" coats by sprinkling talcum powder or cornstarch into the coat, and then brushing it out. Trim the fur that grows between his toes, and trim his toenails as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Start getting your Kuvasz used to brushing and handling when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and grooming sessions when he"s an adult.
Kuvaszok are fond of children, and can be gentle and protective with them. If your kids are playing with friends, though, it"s essential to supervise if a Kuvasz is nearby. He may mistake other children"s play for aggression and will move to protect "his" kids. Kuvaszok puppies can be too rambunctious for young children. As with any dog, always teach children how to safely approach and touch your Kuvasz, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or tail-pulling from either party.

Enjoying strong popularity in short order, this "designer" hybrid became well known quickly. Bred to be a hypoallergenic service dog, the Labradoodle went on to prove that she could also be a versatile family and therapy dog as well. A Labradoodle is happiest when she"s with the people she loves, and she"ll shower her family with affection and devotion. With the energy of the Labrador Retriever and the work ethic of both the Lab and the Poodle, she"s a joy. Thanks to the efforts of a handful of people, the Labradoodle may soon end up as one of the most popular breeds around. A Labradoodle approaches life head-on at breakneck speed, and she approaches every new friend with the same enthusiasm. With training, however, you can teach your Labradoodle proper doggy etiquette. A Labradoodle is generally easy to train, since she"s intelligent and eager to please. She usually does well with other dogs and pets in the household, and she is generally good with children--but she can be exuberant and may unintentionally injure a young child through sheer boisterousness. Overall, however, she makes an excellent pet for a first-time dog owner. She can be calm and quiet while curled up on your feet, but she"s also ready to jump up and play a game of fetch with only a moment"s notice. She"s not an ideal guard dog; although she will alert bark, she"s more likely to invite an intruder in for tea on the good china. While most aspects of Labradoodles are wonderful, many of the dogs are nowhere near what the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia intended, nor what the Association would consider using for a guide dog. The biggest problem with Labradoodles at this time is that there isn"t enough consistency in offspring, no matter whether Poodles are bred to Labs or Labradoodles are bred to Labradoodles. Among purebreds, there are certain characteristics that all of the dogs have in common, even accounting for individual personalities. (For example, you know that a Border Collie is going to herd something, anything.) But so far, even with multigenerational Labradoodles, that consistency is lacking. The hybrid"s popularity has unfortunately added to the problem, because it has encouraged some careless or unethical breeding, particularly from irresponsible breeders who are not familiar with sound breeding practices. Some Labradoodles are more like Poodles: smart, reserved, and quiet with a fine, high-maintenance coat that needs to be trimmed regularly. Poodles are excellent watchdogs, and some (but not all) Labradoodles are as well. Other Labradoodles are more like Labs: rowdy, slow to mature, and prone to shed as often as they breathe. The coat is where one of this hybrid"s greatest discrepancies turns up. The Labradoodle was meant to be nonshedding (like the Poodle), but it"s still common to have more than one coat type, as well as variation in puppy sizes, within one litter. Some people with allergies have had to give up their Labradoodles because of the shedding, which is what they were trying to avoid in the first place. Others end up taking care of a finely-textured Poodle coat, though they had bypassed a purebred Poodle to begin with because they didn"t want to have to consistently trim, comb, and take care of that fine coat, with its tendency to mat and tangle. If you"re allergic to dogs, you"ll still most likely be allergic to Labradoodles, or any of the Doodle mixes. Most people who have allergic reactions aren"t allergic to the coat so much as to the dander, the bits of skin that come off the dog with the shed hair. The less shedding, the less dander that you can react to; but it"s really an individual situation, particularly with the Labradoodle, where there"s a variety of coat types. If this is a foremost concern for you, make sure your breeder understands that so she can help pick out the puppy who is least likely to shed. Sadly, the hybrid"s rapid popularity has already caused Labradoodles to show up in puppy mills and among irresponsible breeders. Puppy mills tend to sell sickly puppies with iffy temperaments. Irresponsible breeders hopping on the designer-dog bandwagon usually don"t produce good puppies because they think breeding is just about simply finding two dogs of the same breed, when it"s far more complicated than that. Efforts have begun to curb this disturbing trend; several organizations now offer breeder referrals and are striving to promote multigenerational breeding. Just be aware that if you"re going to pay the high purchase price of a Labradoodle (which is typically more than you"d pay for either a Poodle or a Lab), you want to do some research to get the best-bred dog possible.
The Labradoodle results from Poodle to Labrador Retriever breedings. There has been some increase in multigenerational breeding (Labradoodle to Labradoodle), and also Labradoodle to Poodle or Labradoodle to Labrador Retriever breeding. Although the Labradoodle is not a recognized breed, the International Australian Labradoodle Association, along with the Australian Labradoodle Association and the Australian Labradoodle Association of America, are taking steps to create a breed standard and unite breeders. You can find a responsible Labradoodle breeder, or links to one, by visiting the Australian Labradoodle Association of America website. Labradoodles are playful and very loving with children, but they can be overexuberant and may knock down younger children unintentionally. The Labradoodle has three different coat types; depending on which coat yours has, you can expect her to be a non- to average shedder. Usually the Labradoodle doesn"t shed excessively, but the Hair coat type is the exception to this rule. A Labradoodle needs one or two brushings per week, as well as regular grooming that includes ear cleaning and nail clipping. The Labradoodle can be a high-energy dog. She requires about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day. Labradoodles are intelligent and need to be mentally and physically stimulated. If they aren"t, they can become destructive and hard to handle. Labradoodles do well with other dogs and pets. Apartments are not the ideal setting for this energetic dog. First-time owners do well with the friendly and amenable Labradoodle. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Labradoodle was originally developed in Australia to be a hypoallergenic guide dog. In 1989, Wally Conron, who was in charge of the breeding program for the Royal Guide Dogs Association of Australia, conducted the first purposeful crossbreeding between a Standard Poodle and Labrador Retriever . This first cross of Conron"s produced a dog called Sultan, who not only had the hypoallergenic coat but also had the aptitude, intelligence, and personality to be an effective guide dog. Sultan went on to work with a woman in Hawaii and was a successful at his work. At that point, other breeders saw the merit of crossing these two breeds. Like the Labrador Retriever parent, the Labradoodle quickly rose in popularity and has become one of the most sought-after "Doodle breeds." These dogs are often produced by crossing a Labrador Retriever with a Poodle, but multigenerational breeding has begun in an attempt to produce a viable and recognizable breed. Both the Australian Labradoodle Association and the International Australian Labradoodle Association are taking steps in this direction (there are no Labradoodle breed clubs in North America), and they hope to move this designer breed into registered breed status in the next few years. These groups have made great efforts to bring breeders together so that they"re working to achieve the same standards through multigenerational breeding.
The Labradoodle comes in three size variations, depending on the size of the Poodle used for the first-generation breeding. The three sizes are Standard, Medium, and Miniature. The Standard Labradoodle should be 22 to 24 inches in height for a male and 21 to 23 inches in height for a female, while both can range in weight from 50 to 65 pounds. The Medium Labradoodle should be 18 to 20 inches high for a male and 17 to 19 inches high for a female, with both weighing from 30 to 45 pounds. The average size for a Miniature Labradoodle is between 14 to 16 inches and 15 to 25 pounds.
The Labradoodle is an intelligent dog who can make the ideal family pet if properly trained. She is friendly and accepts and treats everyone like her best friend. She is devoted to her family and enjoys life as an energetic companion. She can be gentle, but she can also be joyful, showing her happiness through exuberant jumping and playing. She also tends to be easygoing, since the Labradoodle was bred not to be aggressive. As is the case with any breed, some poorly bred ones aren"t all that friendly, but a well-bred Labradoodle with a characteristic temperament is a true joy. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents--usually the mother is the one who"s available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when she grows up. Like every dog, the Labradoodle needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Labradoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling her in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking her to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help her polish his social skills.
Labradoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labradoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Labradoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Ear Infections: These can plague Labradoodles because of their floppy ears. The ears trap moisture and should be regularly checked. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It"s believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Labradoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate for the fact that glucose (sugar) isn"t getting into her cells to burn for energy, because of improper levels of insulin in her body. But she"ll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.
Labradoodles can adapt to just about any setting, but they"re not recommended for apartments. They require about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day and would do better with a fenced yard in which to expel some energy. Some Labradoodles, especially in the first generation, can require even more exercise. The Labradoodle makes an excellent jogging companion but also needs some time off-leash to burn off steam. In addition, she needs to be intellectually stimulated; she"s smart and energetic, so if she becomes bored, she can become a destruction machine. The Labradoodle is an intelligent and eager-to-please dog. Training should be easy as long as consistency and positive reinforcement are the methods. She can make a good companion for first-time dog owners since she doesn"t need an overly firm hand. Socialize her from puppyhood, since she tends to hurl herself headlong into canine situations without regard to the feelings of other dogs. This can lead to some problems if the unknown dog is aggressive. Despite her activity levels, a Labradoodle can adjust to living in suburban or city environments and can do well in rural settings. Although she is used for various working roles, she"s a companion dog through and through, and she should live inside the house, not out in the yard. She"s happiest living in the comforts of home, sleeping soundly on your feet or in a bed next to yours. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Labradoodle doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things she shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where she can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Labradoodle accept confinement if she ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Labradoodle in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and she shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when she"s sleeping at night. Labradoodles are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Labradoodle in good shape by measuring her food and feeding her twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether she"s overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, she needs less food and more exercise. Dividing your Labradoodle"s food into two or more meals per day instead of a big bowl once a day can also lower her risk of gastric torsion, also known as bloat. The Labrador Retriever can suffer from this condition, and it"s a trait that can be easily passed on to any Labradoodle offspring. For more on feeding your Labradoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Although a Labradoodle can have one of a range of coat types, the desired length is 4 to 6 inches. She has a single coat with hair ranging from straight to loose curls. The curls shouldn"t be tight and the coat shouldn"t be thick or fluffy. There are three types of texture: The Hair coat, which is similar to fur in shedding breeds, is the least popular. Hair coats shed and usually have a normal doggy odor. This coat is seen in first generations, although breeders try to avoid it. The second texture, called a Wool coat, is dense and similar in feel to a lamb"s wool, hence its descriptive name. Wool coats hang in loose curls and aren"t dense. Generally, the Wool coat doesn"t have a "doggy" odor and it"s usually nonshedding. The Fleece coat has a silky texture often described as an Angora goat texture. This coat ranges from straight to wavy. Labradoodles are considered to be non- to low shedders, especially those with a Fleece or Wool coat. Hair coats tend to shed just as they do in other breeds, ranging from very low to average shedding. The Labradoodle comes in a wide variety of colors. These can be gold, apricot, caramel, chalk (a chalky white), black, red, café, cream, silver, chocolate, parchment, and blue. They can also have parti-colored coats, which consist of brindles, phantom, patched, or sable colors. Grooming requirements vary depending on the length and type of coat the dog has. Generally speaking, you can expect to brush a Labradoodle about once or twice per week. Some can be clipped or trimmed every six to eight weeks to keep the coat easy to maintain. A Labradoodle should only be bathed when necessary--which isn"t often, as many of the coats don"t have a noticeable doggy odor. Like Labs, Labradoodles can be prone to ear infections, so take a little extra time caring for their ears. Dry and clean them after a swim, and check them once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Labradoodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding--and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Begin accustoming your Labradoodle to being brushed and examined when she"s a puppy. Handle her paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside her mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Labradoodle does well with children and can be an affectionate and gentle companion for any child. She can also be exuberant and might knock down smaller children, but she will love them with all her heart. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Labradoodles usually get along well with other dogs and pets. Like most dogs, they need training and socialization for optimum success at living with and visiting other animals.

The warm and intelligent Lab is America"s number one breed registered with the American Kennel Club. Even non-dog people can recognize a Lab, and artists and photographers have captured his image countless times — usually as the loyal companion, waiting patiently by his owner"s side.Built for sport, the Lab is muscular and athletic. He has a short, easy-care coat, friendly demeanor, keen intelligence, and plenty of energy. Devotion to this breed runs deep; Labs are loving, people-oriented dogs who live to serve their families, and owners and fans sometimes liken their Labs to angels.The breed originated on the island of Newfoundland, off the northeastern Atlantic coast of Canada. Originally called the St. John"s dog, after the capital city of Newfoundland, he was bred to help the local fishermen — hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish that had escaped the nets — as well as to be a family dog.Today, most Labs skip the hard labor and spend their days being pampered and loved by their people. However, some Labs still serve as indispensable working dogs.The Lab"s sweet nature makes him an excellent therapy dog, visiting homes for the elderly and hospitals, and his intelligence makes him an ideal assistance dog for the handicapped. He also excels as a search and rescue dog or as a retriever for hunters, thanks to his athletic build, strong nose, and courageous nature. And Labs have also become the breed to beat at dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions — especially obedience.There"s one dog job that Labs are hopeless at: watchdog. In fact, owners say their sweet, helpful Lab is likely to greet an intruder and happily show him where the goods are stashed.Labrador Retrievers have proven their usefulness and versatility throughout the breed"s history, easily shifting from fisherman"s companion, to field retriever, to show dog, to modern working dog. One role has remained constant: wonderful companion and friend.
Labrador Retrievers love, love, love to eat, and become obese very quickly if overfed. Limit treats, give your Lab plenty of exercise, and measure out regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. And be warned that the Lab"s large appetite extends to people food and even inedible items. Labradors will forage in garbage, counter surf, and can make a meal out of chewed-up items like children"s toys. Labrador Retrievers were bred for physically demanding jobs, and they have the high energy that goes along with being a working breed. They need at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Without it, they can vent their pent-up energy in destructive ways, such as barking and chewing. Labs have such a good reputation that many people think they don"t need to bother with training. But Labs are large, energetic animals, and like all dogs, they need to be taught good canine manners. Sign up for puppy and obedience classes as soon as you bring your Lab home. Many people think of Labs as a hyperactive breed. Lab puppies are definitely lively, but most will slow down a bit as they grow up. However, they usually remain fairly active throughout their lives. Labrador Retrievers are not known to be escape artists, but with the right motivation — such as a whiff of something yummy — a Lab will take off. Make sure your Lab has current identification tags and a microchip. The Lab is America"s number one dog, which means there are plenty of people breeding Labs who are more interested in filling the demand for Lab puppies than in breeding healthy dogs with good temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments. If you"re looking for a puppy, you"ll find that Labs vary depending on what breeder you choose. Some Labs are bred for competitions testing their skill as working dogs, and others are bred to get as close as possible to the ideal look, movement, and temperament of the breed. You"ll also find breeders who aim for both looks and utility. Labs bred for the show ring tend to be slightly heavier and more solidly built than those intended for canine careers.
Labrador Retrievers hail from the island of Newfoundland, off the northeastern Atlantic coast of Canada. Originally called St. John"s dogs, after the capital city of Newfoundland, Labs served as companions and helpers to the local fishermen beginning in the 1700s.The dogs spent their days working alongside their owners, retrieving fish who had escaped hooks and towing in lines, and then returned home to spend the evening with the fishermen"s family.Although his heritage is unknown, many believe the St. John"s dog was interbred with the Newfoundland Dog and other small local water dogs.Outsiders noticed the dog"s usefulness and good disposition, and English sportsmen imported a few Labs to England to serve as retrievers for hunting. The second Earl of Malmesbury was one of the first, and had St. John"s dogs shipped to England sometime around 1830. The third Earl of Malmesbury was the first person to refer to the dogs as Labradors.Amazingly, Labs — now America"s most popular dog — were almost extinct by the 1880s, and the Malmesbury family and other English fans are credited with saving the breed. In Newfoundland, the breed disappeared because of government restrictions and tax laws. Families were allowed to keep no more than one dog, and owning a female was highly taxed, so girl puppies were culled from litters.In England, however, the breed survived, and the Kennel Club recognized the Labrador Retriever as a distinct breed in 1903. The American Kennel Club followed suit in 1917, and in the "20s and "30s, British Labs were imported to establish the breed in the U.S.The breed"s popularity really began to take off after World War II, and in 1991, the Labrador Retriever became the most popular dog registered with the American Kennel Club — and he"s held that distinction ever since. He also tops the list in Canada and England.Today, Labs work in drug and explosive detection, search and rescue, therapy, assistance to the handicapped, and as retrievers for hunters. They also excel in all forms of dog competitions: show, field, agility, and obedience.
Males stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches, and weigh 65 to 80 pounds. Females stand 21.5 to 23.5 inches, and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.
The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and it"s well deserved. He"s outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals.Aside from a winning personality, he has the intelligence and eagerness to please that make him easy to train. Training is definitely necessary because this breed has a lot of energy and exuberance. The working heritage of the Lab means he is active. This breed needs activity, both physical and mental, to keep him happy. There is some variation in the activity level of Labs: some are rowdy, others are more laid back. All thrive on activity.
Labrador Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of "growth formula" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don"t impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they"re bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision, as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Epilepsy: Labs can suffer from epilepsy, which causes mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Lab has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup.Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia (TVD): TVD is a congenital heart defect that has been increasing in prevalence in the Labrador breed. Puppies are born with TVD, which is a malformation of the tricuspid valve on the right side of the heart. It can be mild or severe; some dogs live with no symptoms, others die. TVD is detected by ultrasound. Research is ongoing to learn how widespread it is in the breed, as well as treatment.Myopathy: Myopathy affects the muscles and nervous system. The first signs are seen early, as young as six weeks and often by seven months of age. A puppy with myopathy is tired, stiff when he walks and trots. He may collapse after exercise. In time, the muscles atrophy and the dog can barely stand or walk. There is no treatment, but rest and keeping the dog warm seems to reduce symptoms. Dogs with myopathy should not be bred because it is considered a heritable disease.Gastric Dilataion-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Labs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Acute Moist Dermatitis: Acute moist dermatitis is a skin condition in which the skin red and inflamed. It is caused by a bacterial infection. The more common name of this health concern is hot spots. Treatment includes clipping the hair, bathing in medicated shampoo, and antibiotics.Cold Tail: Cold tail is a benign, though painful condition common to Labs and other retrievers. Also caused limber tail, it caused the dog"s tail to go limp. The dog may bite at the tail. It isn"t cause for alarm, and usually goes away on its own in a few days. It is thought to be a problem with the muscles between the vertebrae in the tail.Ear Infections: The Lab"s love of water, combined with his drop ear make him prone to ear infections. Weekly checking and cleaning if necessary helps prevent infection.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Labs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The lovable Lab needs to be around his family, and is definitely not a backyard dog. If he"s left alone for too long, he"ll probably tarnish his saintly reputation: A lonely, bored Lab is apt to dig, chew, or find other destructive outlets for his energy.Labs show some variation in their activity levels, but all of them need activity, both physical and mental. Daily 30-minute walks, a romp at the dog park, or a game of fetch, are a few ways to help your Lab burn off energy. However, a puppy should not be taken for too long walks and should play for a few minutes at a time. Labrador Retrievers are considered "workaholics," and will exhaust themselves. It is up to you to end play and training sessions.Labs have such good reputations that some owners think they don"t need training. That"s a big mistake. Without training, a rambunctious Lab puppy will soon grow to be a very large, rowdy dog. Luckily, Labs take to training well — in fact, they often excel in obedience competitions.Start with puppy kindergarten, which not only teaches your pup good canine manners, but helps him learn how to be comfortable around other dogs and people. Look for a class that uses positive training methods that reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong.You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Lab puppy. Don"t let your Lab puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he"s at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility, with its one-inch jumps.Like all retrievers, the Lab is mouthy, and he"s happiest when he has something, anything, to carry in his mouth. He"s also a chewer, so be sure to keep sturdy toys available all the time — unless you want your couch chewed up. And when you leave the house, it"s wise to keep your Lab in a crate or kennel so he"s can"t get himself into trouble chewing things he shouldn"t.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Lab in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Lab puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Feed your puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.For more on feeding your Lab, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The sleek and easy-care Lab coat has two layers: a short, thick, straight topcoat, and a soft, weather-resistant undercoat. The two-layer coat protects him from the cold and wet, which helps him in his role as a retriever for hunters.The coat comes in three colors: chocolate, black, and yellow. Black was the favorite color among early breeders, but over the years, yellow and chocolate Labs have become popular. Some breeders have recently begun selling "rare" colored Labrador Retrievers, such as polar white or fox red. These shades aren"t really rare — they"re a variation of the yellow Lab.Grooming doesn"t get much easier than with a Lab, but the breed does shed — a lot. Buy a quality vacuum cleaner and brush your dog daily, especially when he"s shedding, to get out the loose hair.Labs need a bath about every two months or so to keep them looking clean and smelling good. Of course, if your Lab rolls in a mud puddle or something foul, which he"s apt to do, it"s fine to bathe him more often.Brush your Lab"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Lab enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Because ear infections are common in Labs, also clean out the ears after bathing, swimming, or any time your dog gets wet. This helps prevent infection.Begin accustoming your Lab to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Labrador Retriever not only loves kids, he enjoys the commotion they bring with them. He"ll happily attend a child"s birthday party, and even willingly wear a party hat. Like all dogs, however, he needs to be trained how to act around kids — and kids need to be taught how to act around the dog.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If a Lab has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals, and has been trained how to interact with them, he"ll be friendly with other pets, too.

Created to be a practical working terrier, the Lakeland hails from England"s beautiful but rugged and mountainous Lake District, where his job was to hunt and kill the foxes that plagued farmers. He"s small, square, and sturdy, with a deep, relatively narrow body that allows him to squeeze into rocky dens after his prey. Lakies, as these lively, feisty little dogs are nicknamed, are affectionate, friendly, and self-confident. They"re characterized by a rectangular head, an intense and sometimes impish expression, v-shaped ears that fold over, and a docked tail carried up. They have a double coat: a thick, hard topcoat to protect them from thorns and a dense undercoat to keep them warm in the hail, sleet, snow, and rain of their home region. Alert and ready to go, Lakies often look as if they"re standing on their tiptoes. The Lakeland is cheerful and energetic, but like any self-respecting terrier, he can be willful and determined. Nonetheless, his people are enchanted by his charm, intelligence, and sense of humor. Lakies have a lot of courage and confidence. They generally get along well with children and other dogs, but are reserved with strangers. Being terriers, they are prone to chasing small animals, so it"s advisable to socialize them with cats and other small animals from an early age. Like many terriers, Lakelands can be difficult to housetrain, and they have their own thoughts about what constitutes proper behavior, which may not be the same as yours. Also, some like to dig, bark quite a lot, and guard their toys and food. Therefore, they need to have firm, patient training from an early age. They are intelligent dogs, so be sure that your training has lots of variety to keep them challenged. Also, you must be fair in your training techniques. All terriers have a sense of fairness and are willing to be corrected when it is merited. But if the correction is harsh or undeserved, they are likely to growl and rebel. Using proper training techniques, you"ll find that your Lakeland is quick to learn. Because he has a great deal of energy, you might want to consider training him for obedience or agility. Lakies are small dogs, so it would seem that they would be good for apartment dwellers. Unfortunately, their propensity for barking might rule that out, unless you put in the time to train them to be quiet. Grooming is moderately time-consuming. They need to be brushed two or three times a week and "stripped" periodically to keep their coats in proper condition. Although they have many fine qualities, Lakelands are uncommon and aren"t readily available. Expect to spend some time on a waiting list, as much as six months to a year, if you want one of these charming terriers.
Never purchase a Lakeland from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents with a nice temperament. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they"re happy with their Lakeland. Doing your homework may save you from a lot of heartbreak later. Lakeland Terriers are excitable dogs and have a lot of energy. They are a highly intelligent breed that can take advantage of an insecure owner and become the "ruler of the house." Be sure that your Lakie knows who is alpha in your household (hopefully, you!). Lakeland Terriers are prone to chasing other animals or anything else that might interest them. Keep them on a leash when you"re in unfenced areas. Speaking of fences, it"s best that you have a fenced yard for your Lakies to play in. Just be sure that the fence is very secure. They can be escape artists! Barking sometimes is a problem with Lakeland Terriers. Lakeland Terriers can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. Lakeland Terriers tend to be possessive about their food and toys. Obedience training is recommended. Their terrier aggression can get out of hand without proper respect for their owners and training.
The Lakeland Terrier was born in the county of Cumberland in England"s beautiful but treacherously rugged Lake District near the Scottish border. The Lake District is known for its beautiful hills and mountains. Beatrix Potter had a farm here, where she, like many of the farmers in this region, raised a rare hardy breed of sheep called Herdwicks. The terrain is harsh and rugged, and sheep farms dotted the scenic countryside. A large, aggressive type of fox called a Westmoreland fox preys on the sheep, especially during the lambing season, which happens to coincide with the time that the foxes are weaning their cubs. The Lakeland"s job was to "go to ground" when the fox ran into its burrow and kill it. Some of the game little terriers also were owned by miners and other workers who used them for sport, such as badger digging, rabbiting, ratting, and fox hunting. Eventually, "meets" were held where people could show off their dogs. The Lakelands first were classified as colored working terriers to differentiate them from white terriers (even though sometimes both were out of the same litter). Lakelands are related to several terrier breeds, including the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now extinct), the Dandie Dinmont and Bedlington Terriers, and the Border Terrier. They are one of the oldest working terrier breeds still in use today. In 1921 the Lakeland Terrier Association was formed in England. They were first exhibited in England under a variety of names, including the Fell and Patterdale Terrier. The American Kennel Club first registered a Lakeland Terrier, Eaton What A Lad Of Howtown, in 1934, by which time it had its current name and was a regular in the show rings both in the U.S. and England. Breeders worked to produce dogs that would have the looks to win in the show ring while retaining the working characteristics that were so prized. They appear to have succeeded in grand style. Lakelands have won most of the major shows and awards that can be found around the world. The first great champion Lakeland Terrier was named Rogerholme Recruit, who won Best in Show at the prestigious 1963 Crufts dog show England. Just three years later, in 1967, another English Lakeland Terrier named Stingray of Derryabahwon Best in Show at the 1967 Crufts and Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show in 1968. In the early seventies, Ch Special Edition won dozens of Bests in Show, and another Lakie named Ch Jo-Ni"s Red Baron of Crofton won 73 Bests in Show, with the last being awarded at the 1976 at Westminster"s Centennial dog show. Several other Lakeland Terriers also have proven the appeal of the breed in the show ring by winning multiple Bests in Show, Groups, and other awards. In the early 1990s, an outstanding Lakie named Ch. Revelry"s Awesome Blossom, owned by Jean L. Heath and comedian Bill Cosby, emerged. Her remarkable show record included more than 100 All-Breed Bests-in-Show, making her among the top-winning show dogs of all time.
The compact and athletic Lakeland Terrier is typically 13 1/2 to 14 1/2 inches tall, and weighs 15 to 17 pounds.
The typical Lakeland is bold and friendly. He"s described as having a "cock of the walk" attitude, but he"s neither overly aggressive or argumentative. All terrier, he"s curious about everything, intelligent, and entertaining. He"s usually reserved with strangers but loves his family, especially the kids. With other dogs, he might not start a fight, but he certainly won"t back down from one. Alert and self-confident, he makes an excellent watchdog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Lakelands need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Lakeland puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Lakeland Terriers are a hardy breed and don"t suffer from any known hereditary health problems. To help ensure that you get a healthy Lakeland puppy, choose a breeder who abides by the U. S. Lakeland Terrier Club code of ethics.
The Lakeland should live in the home with his people, not outdoors. Because of his small size, the Lakeland Terrier is good for apartment life so long as you train him not to bark at every noise he hears. He"s active indoors and will do all right without a yard so long as you provide him with one or two daily walks of 20 to 30 minutes. If he has a yard, it should be securely fenced as he"s a capable digger and escape artist. Don"t count on an underground electronic fence to keep him confined; the threat of a shock is nothing to a tough terrier who wants to go after something. Ideally, he should be able run and play off leash regularly in a safe area. Keep the Lakie on leash when you walk him. You never know when his terrier instinct to hunt will kick in. With his independent nature, the Lakie can be a challenge to train. Keep your sense of humor at the ready, as well as a large supply of patience. Be firm and consistent, but use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play to get the most out of him. Keep lessons short, sweet, and entertaining, and you"ll find that your Lakeland is quite intelligent and capable of learning whatever you can teach. Housetraining can sometimes be a problem with this breed. Patience and consistency are musts. Take him out to potty first thing in the morning, after every meal, after naps and playtime, and just before bedtime. Reward him every time he potties outdoors. Crate training helps as well. Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Lakeland doesn"t get into things he shouldn"t. Like every dog, Lakies can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Lakeland accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Lakeland in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Lakies are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. The Lakeland excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Keep this in mind if he"ll be living in an apartment or condo community.
Recommended daily amount: 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your adult Lakeland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Lakeland, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog."
Lakeland Terriers have a thick, hard topcoat and a soft undercoat. When he"s hand stripped to show his outline, he has a neat, workmanlike appearance. In the show ring, the coat on the head, ears, forechest, shoulders, and behind the tail is trimmed short and smooth. The coat on the body is about half an inch to an inch long and can be straight or slightly wavy. The long hair on the legs, known as furnishings, gives the legs a cylindrical appearance. The hair on the face is trimmed but left longer over the eyes to enhance the head"s rectangular appearance. Lakies come in many colors, including blue, black, liver (a deep reddish-brown), red, and wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a tan saddle that covers the back of the neck, back, sides, and up the tail, making them blue and tan, black and tan, or liver and tan. They can also be what"s called red grizzle or grizzle and tan. A red grizzle Lakeland has a saddle that"s a deep, rich red over a tan base. Grizzle is a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs. Puppies often are born dark. Lakelands don"t shed much, especially if their coat is kept stripped. Stripping is a technique that involves plucking the dead hair by hand or removing it with a stripping knife or other stripping tool. Your Lakeland"s breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it (not all do). For easier care, you can clipper the coat, but the texture and color will become softer and lighter. That doesn"t affect the Lakeland"s ability to be a great companion, though. Spend 15 to 30 minutes a week to brush and comb your Lakie. Then give him a rubdown with a towel to remove any dirt and excess body oils. If you do this regularly, you shouldn"t need to bathe him often unless he"s rolled in something stinky. Remove loose hair from inside the ears and trim excess hair between the pads of the feet. Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Lakeland"s nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Lakie to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Lakies love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but certain rules apply to child-dog interactions. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Lakelands can get along well with other pets, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. They shouldn"t be aggressive toward strange dogs, but they won"t back down from them either. They may chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they probably shouldn"t be trusted alone with pocket pets such as hamsters and gerbils.
Lakeland Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption or fostering. Abandoned Terrier Rescue Association United States Lakeland Terrier Club Lakeland Terrier Rescue

In his past, the Lancashire Heeler was used to drive livestock to market. He was short enough to nip at their heels to move them along and agile enough to leap out of the way if they tried to kick. When he wasn"t on the road to the market, he helped out on the farm by catching rats and rabbits. He resembles his cousins the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis but has a black-and-tan coloration that may be a sign of Manchester Terrier heritage. In his homeland of Great Britain, he"s a popular companion, show dog, and agility and obedience competitor. He also competes at herding trials. This is an intelligent dog who learns quickly, but he has a mind of his own and can be stubborn as well as mischievously inventive. Train him with kind but firm consistency and positive reinforcement. With other people he"s generally friendly but he can be sharp toward other dogs. Early socialization with people and other dogs is important. He"s best suited to families with school-age children and enjoys having a yard where he can run. Be sure it"s escapeproof!

Dog Breed Group:  Working DogsHeight:  2 feet, 1 inch to 2 feet, 7 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  120 to 170 poundsLife Span:  10 to 12 years
Originally from Germany, where he was created through crosses between Newfoundlands, longhaired Saint Bernards, plus some Great Pyrenees, this giant breed requires a commitment to training and a high tolerance for mischief and mess. He looks beautiful in the show ring, but his natural state is more along the lines of damp and muddy than leonine elegance. That, along with long fur and copious shedding, makes this a poor choice for neatniks. Early and extensive socialization and training with plenty of positive reinforcement and consistent expectations will turn him into a family friend like no other, but without them he"s mischievous and destructive. The Leo"s high energy levels and intelligence make him a super competitor in agility and obedience trials, and he"s also found doing therapy visits and water rescue work. Leos like living in a pride of their own kind, but they get along well with other animals, too, including cats and horses. Because of their great size, they should never be left alone with young children. This is a sensitive dog who dislikes family arguments. Keep your disagreements private or he may try to intervene. The Leo loves being with his people and won"t be happy to spend all his time alone in the backyard. Expect to give him about an hour of exercise daily.Take the Leo"s size into consideration before bringing one home; this breed needs a family with a yard and an SUV, not a studio apartment and a Miata. The coat sheds heavily twice a year and moderately the rest of the time. On the plus side, his deep bark and huge size are more than enough to put off any halfway intelligent intruder.

Dog Breed Group:  Companion DogsHeight:  9 inches to 11 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  12 to 15 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The Lhasa Apso thinks he"s a large dog, a very large dog. Bred for hundreds of years to be a royal watchdog, the modern Lhasa approaches life the way his forebears did: he is a loyal guardian of home and family. The Lhasa"s protective nature can surprise those unfamiliar with him, given his small size and long, flowing coat. He certainly doesn"t appear fierce. But when it comes to protecting his own, the Lhasa is fierce, though never unusually aggressive. He"s naturally suspicious of strangers — an excellent trait for a palace guard — and he takes his job as protector seriously. The lionhearted Lhasa"s devotion also means he enjoys sharing life with his family. He"s intelligent, independent (a watchdog must think on his own), and mischievous. If you are considering a Lhasa — and many find his looks irresistible — you must consider this breed"s protective nature. Early socialization and training are absolutely critical to a Lhasa"s success as a family member, so that he can properly direct his natural tendency toward wariness. The time invested in training him, however, is well worth your effort in terms of the loyalty, joy, and companionship that this long-lived, hardy little dog provides. The Lhasa likes doing his own thing, which means his goal in life is not necessarily to please you. In this he differs from such breeds as the biddable Labrador Retriever. While the Lhasa can be trained successfully, he is not always the most obedient dog in the class. But those who know and love the Lhasa praise his smarts and unique ability to reason. He can even tend toward manipulation, so consistency is key in training the Lhasa pup (just as it is with raising children). If you don"t take charge, your Lhasa will certainly try. Few pups are cuter than the Lhasa puppy, with his sparking eyes and fluffy coat. These little ones are curious and full of energy, and they love to play. The Lhasa matures slowly and remains puppyish until he"s three years old. New owners need to keep this in mind when training Lhasa puppies, or they can become frustrated with the Lhasa"s refusal to take lessons too seriously. Housetraining can be difficult; crate training is recommended. Now, about that Lhasa coat — it"s splendid: long, thick, and beautiful. It"s also a chore to keep in good condition. Daily brushing and combing are necessary to keep it free of tangles. Frequent bathing is necessary, too, to keep the Lhasa smelling sweet. Some owners opt to trim the coat short, or trim the hair around the face. If you are considering a Lhasa, know that you"ll be doing a lot of grooming, or that you"ll be on a first-name basis with a professional groomer. What about children and the Lhasa? Be aware that the breed is known for being impatient with the normal clumsiness associated with children; he"ll nip. He tends to bond with adults more than with youngsters, but this isn"t a hard-and-fast rule. Older children, or young children who are exceptionally gentle with dogs, can live happily with the Lhasa. If you are seeking a 100 percent "kid dog," the Lhasa is probably not a good choice. The average Lhasa lives a long time: 12 to 15 years is not uncommon, and some live 17 to 20 years.
The Lhasa is highly independent; his aim is to please himself, not you. The Lhasa is a leader, and he"ll be your leader if you allow him to. The Lhasa is a naturally protective watchdog. There"s no changing this, though you can teach him good canine manners. Early, positive socialization is essential to help him become a friendly, sociable pet. The Lhasa matures slowly. Don"t expect too much too soon. The beautiful Lhasa coat needs a lot of grooming. Expect to do a lot of work, or to pay a professonial groomer. Dental care is essential. Brush the Lhasa"s teeth regularly, and have your veterinarian check his teeth and gums periodically. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Lhasa comes from Tibet, and he takes his name from the holy city of Lhasa. For thousands of years, the Lhasa was bred exclusively by nobility and monks in monasteries to act an inside guard and protector. He"s known in his homeland as Abso Seng Kye, which translates as "Bark Lion Sentinel Dog." The Lhasa"s thick coat is protective; his native climate is one of intense cold and extreme heat. Recorded history of the breed goes back to 800 B.C. A Lhasa was considered good luck, but it was nearly impossible to buy one: he was a watchdog in temples and monasteries and was therefore considered sacred. It was thought that when an owner died, the human soul entered the body of his Lhasa Apso. Lhasas were not allowed to leave the country except when given as gifts by the Dalai Lama. From the beginning of the Manchu Dynasty in 1583 until as recently as 1908, the Dalai Lama sent Lhasas as sacred gifts to the Emperor of China and members of the Imperial family. The Lhasas were always given in pairs and were thought to bring with them good luck and prosperity. The first Lhasas to enter the United States directly were given as gifts by the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933 to C. Suydam Cutting, a noted world traveler and naturalist. Cutting owned Hamilton Farm in Gladstone, New Jersey, and the two gift dogs became the foundation stock for his kennel. The American Kennel Club accepted the Lhasa Apso as a breed in 1935.
Males stand 10 to 11 inches high and weigh 13 to 15 pounds; females are slightly smaller.
The Lhasa Apso personality is a special and interesting mix. He"s a happy, mischievous, and playful dog; he"s also regal, independent, and fierce. He takes the job of guarding his home and family seriously; he also takes a long time to grow up, and even then he remains somewhat puppyish until old age. The Lhasa may be small, but he isn"t a bit fragile. He"s sturdy and strong, and he"s naturally wary of strangers. He will make friends, but not until he knows that an individual poses no threat. He"s an excellent watchdog. The independent Lhasa likes to be "top dog." Training and socialization, beginning with puppy classes, are essential. They"ll teach him good canine manners and prevent him from thinking he can rule the roost. Lhasa owners must be strong, kind leaders. The Lhasa is not extremely active and is content living indoors. Unlike many other breeds, he doesn"t need vigorous exercise to reduce nervous energy. However, he does enjoy and benefit from short walks and play sessions. The Lhasa likes to stay close to his family, following them room to room to join in the activities or sit on a lap. However, because of his independent nature, he"s fine when left alone at home for reasonable amounts of time. The Lhasa doesn"t usually suffer from separation anxiety. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
Lhasas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Lhasas will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Lhasas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cherry Eye: This malady occurs when the gland known as the third eyelid swells. It looks like a red mass — a cherry — at the inner corner of the dog"s eye. The treatment for cherry eye is usually surgery. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Lhasa Apso is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): This is a serious problem in dogs. This genetic skin condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and they"re eventually destroyed. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin, an unpleasant odor, and secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Commonly known as dry eye, this is an inflammation of the eye that occurs when the tear production is deficient. The symptoms, a gooey yellow discharge, can be mistaken for conjunctivitis. Treatment includes medication, artificial tears, and sometimes surgery. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Familial Inherited Renal Dysplasia: This is a developmental or genetic defect of the kidneys, which are noticeably small and irregular in shape. The disease varies in severity: severely affected puppies are excessively thirsty and small for their age, and they often suffer renal failure. Mildly affected dogs may show no symptoms.
The Lhasa is a great choice for people with limited space. He"s well suited for apartment or condo living, though he does enjoy playing outside in a fenced yard. The Lhasa is content with several short walks each day. He is not high-energy dog, and he doesn"t tend to bounce off the walls when cooped up on a rainy day. He"s happy sitting in your lap, wandering around the house, playing with his toys, and alerting you to passersby. Housetraining the Lhasa can be challenging, so it"s wise to crate train. Also, remember that this dog will likely take a long time to mature mentally. He may reach full size at one year of age, but his behavior will still be quite puppyish. Be especially patient during training — keep it positive and consistent, and be willing to go the long haul.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Lhasa in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Lhasa, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Lhasa coat is gorgeous. Normally it is long, straight, and dense. It comes in many colors, including honey, black, white, slate, or parti-color. Keeping the Lhasa coat gorgeous, however, is time-consuming and difficult. Regular, even daily, brushing and combing are necessary, as is frequent bathing (every two to four weeks). Many owners elect to hire a professional groomer, because although a hardworking owner can learn to manage the Lhasa"s coat, it"s certainly not a job for beginners. In fact, it"s not uncommon for owners to have their Lhasa"s coat clipped short to cut down on grooming chores. The beautiful flowing coat is gone, but what"s left is a lot easier to care for. Brush your Lhasa"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Lhasa to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Children are probably not at the top of the Lhasa"s list of favorite things. He tends to be intolerant of the normal antics of children, and he"ll nip. The Lhasa is best suited to a home with older children who understand how to properly handle him. He"s not advised for a family with young or rowdy kids. If he"s properly socialized and trained, the Lhasa gets along with other dogs. He does like to be top dog, so he"s often the leader, even around other dogs who are much larger. He isn"t afraid to join in activities normally associated with large dogs, such as hiking or cross-country skiing. The Lhasa thinks he"s a large dog. The Lhasa can get along with other pets as well, given proper introductions and training.
Lhasa Apsos are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Lhasa Apsos in need of adoption and/or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club, and they can point you toward a Lhasa Apso rescue organization. American Lhasa Apso Club

With a name that translates to "lion dog," you might expect the Lowchen to have a fierce demeanor, but with people he"s lionlike only in his looks. Playful and gentle, the Lowchen is a great companion for children and adults alike. He is surprisingly robust and loves to roughhouse with his people. The Lowchen generally gets along well with everyone, but he can be shy of strangers. With proper socialization, this trait can be overcome, however. Generally, Lowchen will fit into any household whether there are dogs before they arrive or not. They also get along well with other pets. The Lowchen is affectionate and loving. They thrive when they are with their people and can fit wherever that person is living, be it an apartment or a large estate. They should not be left outside or in a kennel, and doing so will not only lead to ill health for the dog but also to many temperamental problems. Lowchens are not known for their high activity levels, but they enjoy their role as watch dog and will bark an alert whenever they see something they think merits a response. Some can also be partial to digging, and this habit can be difficult to break. The name "lion dog" comes from the traditional Lowchen clip, with close-cut hindquarters and a full, natural mane, but the nickname applies to the little dog"s big personality as well. Lowchen have the "small dog...big personality" down pat, and that can be a joy and a frustration. They are lively and energetic, sweet and affectionate, and they will challenge any dog or rule if they decide to. They will take over the homes and lives of the people they love, and with their fierce determination and wonderful even temperament they will take over their owners" hearts as well.
The Lowchen was not developed to be an outdoor or kennel dog. They are companion dogs and are happiest when they are in the company of the people they love. Barking is a much-enjoyed pastime for the Lowchen. They make excellent watchdogs with their alarm barking but they may become a nuisance to neighbors. Lowchen make wonderful apartment residents as long as their exercise requirements are met. Expect to spend at least 20 minutes per day exercising him. He makes an excellent walking companion and will go for long walks with his people. Although the Lowchen doesn"t shed much, he still requires regular brushing and grooming to prevent tangles and mats and keep him in good health. Although not all Lowchen exhibit this trait, many enjoy digging and the habit may be difficult to discourage. Lowchen can be shy of new people, and it is important to socialize them at a young age to discourage any fearfulness or timid behaviors. Lowchens are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety whenever their companions leave for the day. They are not the best breed for people who work long hours. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
There are several theories as to the origins of the Lowchen, and the debate is often steeped in controversy. One theory has the breed originating in Northern Europe, which includes Germany, Belgium, and France. It is believed that the Lowchen may be one of the founding breeds in the development of the Toy Poodle or may be linked to the founding breed. Another theory is that the Lowchen is related to the Bichon breeds and originated in the Mediterranean. The third and possibly fourth theories are that the Lowchen may have originated in Russia or even Tibet. Wherever the breed originated, we do know that its primary purpose was as a companion dog. It may also have been used as a rodent hunter and possibly as a little alarm dog. We also know that people in all stations of life owned the Lowchen, and they could be found in farms and castles alike. The Lowchen has been depicted in art around the world through the centuries and the breed today is relatively unchanged from what it looked like centuries ago. Over the years, Lowchen became less popular, and toward the end of the 19th century only a few remained. In 1897, a breeder named Madelaine Bennert took on the effort to save the Lowchen from the brink of extinction. She was successful, although World Wars I and II again threatened to wipe out the breed. Madame Bennert restarted her effort to save the breed and spent the years after the war searching for the remaining Lowchen lines that had escaped the war. With the help of Dr. Hans Rickert, whose dogs were originally purchased from Madame Bennert and are the dogs that contributed to the breed as they are today, and a few other owners and breeder, the Lowchen was able to recover as a breed. Although he is still rare today, the Lowchen is assured of a future. The first Lowchen arrived in the United States in 1971, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1999.
The Lowchen is slightly longer than he is tall. The ideal height for a Lowchen is 12 to 14 inches, and he generally weighs between 9 and 18 pounds.
The Lowchen is the personification of an even-tempered breed. He is lively and active, affectionate and gentle. He is an intelligent dog who learns quickly and easily. Lowchen are fearless watchdogs and will often alert bark if they see something or someone suspicious. They don"t seem to mind that they are small and will challenge larger dogs if they feel the need. They take control of their home, and their people may feel as if they"ve become a beloved possession of their sweet little dog. There is no doubt that the Lowchen is a wonderful breed with a cheerful disposition who has many people opening their hearts and homes to not just one but to many Lowchen companions. The Lowchen is a wonderful breed to train. They are intelligent and take to training very quickly. Like many toy breeds, they can have issues with housetraining, but this can be overcome with patience and consistency. Socialization is a must for this breed, which can be shy around people. Lowchen that are not properly socialized can become fearful or timid. They generally get along well with other pets, but socialization with other dogs is important for all breeds.
Lowchens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Lowchens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Lowchens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified on a yearly basis. Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.
Lowchen make excellent apartment residents, but they can be prone to excessive barking. It is important to take this trait into consideration before bringing a Lowchen into your home since some apartment buildings and neighborhoods have noise restrictions. The Lowchen is not an outdoor dog or a kennel dog. Although they enjoy going outside to play and romp and enjoy the company of other dogs, their heart lies with their people and they prefer being with them whenever they can.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Lowchen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Lowchen has a dense coat that is long and moderately wavy with a soft texture. Lowchens can be found in all colors and combinations, and there is no preference for any one color or combination. Lowchens can be clipped or kept in a natural coat. When clipped, they are given a "Lion Trim." The hair is shortened to 1/8th of an inch in length from the last rib to the rump, as well as on the legs, with cuffs of hair just above the feet. The tail is also trimmed, with a plume left at the tip of the tail. Regular brushing keeps the coat from tangling. This breed sheds very little. Brush your Lowchen"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Lowchen to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Lowchen make excellent dogs for families with either children or other pets. They generally do well with children and enjoy playing with them. They are surprisingly robust and exceedingly gentle. Lowchen are also very sociable and will do well in homes with other pets and dogs. Unaware of their small size, they often have a desire to challenge larger dogs that they meet in public, so it"s important to protect them from themselves.
Lowchens are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Lowchens in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don"t see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Lowchen rescue. Lowchen Club of America Rescue

The Saluki"s origins are shrouded in the sands of time, but his history is believed to go back to antiquity. He is the very definition of grace and speed, well deserving of the name bestowed on him by his Arab breeders — The Noble. The Saluki is bred for speed, strength, and endurance, qualities that are evident in his long, narrow head and sleek yet muscular body. Beautiful but reserved, the Saluki is affectionate without being overly demonstrative. He"s happy to prove his loyalty through quiet companionship. Not everyone is offered the gift of a Saluki"s devoted friendship, but those happy few who receive it are appreciative of the honor. Salukis are widely admired for their exotic appearance, but not everyone is well suited to live with this spirited and independent hunter. Any movement, be it a squirrel, cat, or radio-controlled car, will activate the Saluki"s instinct to chase, and his speed has been clocked at 30 to 35 miles per hour. Unless he"s protected by a strong human on the other end of the leash or a securely fenced yard, he"s likely to meet his end beneath the wheels of a car. You might think that Salukis living in the country would have fewer issues, but they"ve been known to chase down and tangle with or kill goats, otters, foxes, raccoons, snakes, squirrels, and deer. To keep a Saluki safe and well exercised, provide him with 300 to 400 lateral feet of fenced area where he can run full out. If your yard isn"t that large, you should have easy access to a fenced park, an enclosed sports field at a school, or a beach with no nearby road. On leash, the Saluki makes an excellent jogging companion — if you can keep up with him. He"s also a good competitor in agility and lure coursing. Some Salukis participate in obedience and tracking as well. Indoors, the Saluki will make himself at home on your soft sofa or bed. He likes his comforts and needs cushioning for his somewhat bony body. Using his long, skinny muzzle, he"ll surf your kitchen counters in search of anything edible. The calm and gentle Saluki can become timid and shy without early socialization and regular reinforcement through new experiences and introductions to many different people throughout his life. Generally quiet but alert, he"s a good watchdog, but not a guard dog. Salukis are fearless in the hunt but otherwise unaggressive. Training a Saluki is possible, but don"t expect the perfect obedience you might have from a Golden Retriever. Salukis think for themselves, and if something else is more interesting than what you"re asking them to do, they"re perfectly happy to ignore you. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, never harsh verbal or physical corrections. Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. While Salukis aren"t overly demonstrative, they do become strongly attached to their people and dislike being left alone for long periods. Consider a Saluki if you have time to give to a devoted, graceful friend who can run like the wind.
Salukis love to run and need regular daily exercise. They must be kept on leash whenever they"re not in a securely fenced area. They have a strong prey drive and will pursue anything furry and in motion, heedless of their owner"s commands. Salukis are a reserved breed although they"re devoted to their people. Early and ongoing socialization is important for this breed to prevent shyness and skittishness. Salukis are not recommended for apartments. They require a large fenced yard where they can run safely. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended; their prey drive is so strong they"ll push past it. It is important to provide comfortable bedding for a Saluki since he doesn"t have enough body fat to provide padding. Salukis should not live outdoors. They thrive on human companionship and will become depressed if left alone for long periods. Although these dogs can make gentle and calm companions for older children, they are not recommended for homes with small children. Salukis are generally quiet dogs. When training a Saluki, be consistent, and use only positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, since the breed is so sensitive. Salukis are fastidious and like to be clean. They shed little and require only weekly brushing. Salukis should not reside in homes that have small pets. Even with the best training, a Saluki will view small pets as prey and will try to hunt them. Salukis prefer the companionship of other Salukis, but they can get along with other dogs that do not have dominant natures. Salukis can be picky eaters. Never buy a Saluki from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
Once known as the Persian Greyhound or the gazelle hound, the Saluki has long been considered one of the most ancient of breeds. Recent genetic evidence confirms this to be the case. Scientists speculate that Salukis and other ancient breeds descend from the first dogs and made their way through the world with their nomadic owners. Depictions of dogs resembling Salukis — with a Greyhoundlike body and feathering on the ears, tail, and legs — appear on Egyptian tombs dating to 2100 B.C.E., some 4,000 years ago. Even older are carvings from the Sumerian empire (7,000-6,000 B.C.E.) that show dogs with a striking resemblance to the Saluki. Pharaohs hunted gazelles and hares with Salukis, which often worked in partnership with falcons. The dogs were frequently honored with mummification after death. Nomadic Muslims, who generally despised dogs as unclean animals, considered Salukis a gift from Allah and referred to the dogs by the honorific El Hor, meaning The Noble. Salukis were the only dogs permitted to sleep inside the tents. The breed may take its name from the ancient city of Saluk, in Yemen, or perhaps from the city of Seleukia in Syria. Another theory suggests that the name is a transliteration of the Arabic word for hound. Salukis were widespread in the Middle East and could be found in Persia (modern-day Iran), Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia. The first documented case of Salukis arriving in Britain was in 1840, but it wasn"t until after World War I, when many British officers returned with them from the Middle East, that the breed became established in Great Britain. Interest in the Saluki was slower to take hold in the United States. The Saluki Club of America was founded in 1927, the same year the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Saluki registered by the AKC was Jinniyat of Grevel in 1929. Today the Saluki is a rare treasure, ranking 116th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Saluki males stand 23 to 28 inches at the shoulder; females are significantly smaller. Weight ranges from 35 to 70 pounds.
The Saluki is an aloof dog, but one who"s devoted to his family. He"s gentle and thrives on quiet companionship. He has a tendency to bond with a single person, which can lead to separation anxiety. With strangers, Salukis are reserved, and they can be shy if they"re not socialized at an early age. Socialization should continue throughout their life. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They"re sensitive dogs and will pick up on and become stressed by tensions in the home. Salukis love comfort and enjoy being pampered with soft bedding and access to furniture. Like cats, they"re fastidious about personal cleanliness. Like every dog, Salukis need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saluki puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
The Saluki is a hardy breed that does not suffer from many genetically inherited diseases. The following problems may be seen in Salukis: Anesthesia Sensitivity: Because of their low level of body fat, sighthounds such as the Saluki have a reputation for being sensitive to anesthesia and certain other drugs. Fortunately, the new drugs available these days have properties that make sighthound reactions to drugs much less likely. In addition, most veterinarians are aware of the special anesthesia and drug needs of sighthounds, but it never hurts to confirm this awareness if you"re taking your Saluki to a new veterinarian. Hemangiosarcoma: This malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels and the spleen. Cardiomyopathy: This disease of the heart muscle takes two forms: dilated and hypertrophic. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the progressive enlargement of the ventricles, the heart"s main pumping chambers. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes a drastic increase in heart muscle mass. DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and tends to affect young to middle-aged males in larger breeds. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Salukis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for cardiac (heart) and thyroid disease. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Salukis are not suited for apartment life. They need a home with a large, securely fenced yard where they can run flat out. The ideal running area for a Saluki is 300 to 400 feet in length or width. Fences should be at least five to six feet high or a Saluki will easily jump them. Underground electronic fencing will not contain a Saluki, nor will it protect him from other animals that might enter your yard. Keep your Saluki on leash whenever he"s not in an enclosed area. A Saluki was bred for hunting and has a strong prey drive. If he sees anything fast and furry, he"ll pursuit it for as long as he can, disregarding any commands to come or stop. Salukis are indoor dogs and require soft, cushioned bedding to prevent calluses from forming. Place food well out of reach of the Saluki"s inquiring nose. That means behind closed doors or up about seven feet. Salukis are intelligent and learn quickly, but they"re also independent and can be stubborn, which makes training a challenge. To hold your Saluki"s attention, keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. If a Saluki becomes bored, he will choose not to learn. Use positive reinforcement, never harsh verbal or physical corrections.
Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Salukis are the supermodels of the dog world and can be picky eaters. Remember that they are supposed to look sleek, and you may just barely see the outline of their ribs beneath their skin. For more on feeding your Saluki, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Saluki has a short, smooth, silky body coat. The entire body can be smooth, or the Saluki can have slight feathering on the legs, the backs of the thighs and sometimes the shoulders, and the underside of the tail. The long ears are covered with silky hair. Salukis come in white, cream, fawn, golden, grizzle and tan, black and tan, and tricolor (white, black, and tan). The pigmentation of the nose is black or liver. Salukis are a clean, low-shedding breed with no doggy odor. Brush the coat weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Comb feathering once or twice a week to remove tangles. A wipedown with a damp cloth is generally enough to keep your Saluki clean, so bathe him only if he"s dirty. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Saluki"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Saluki jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Saluki used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They won"t chase small dogs or cats in their own household, but other animals, such as pet birds, mice, rabbits, or hamsters could prove too much of a temptation.

Dog Breed Group:  Terrier DogsHeight:  9 inches to 10 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  11 to 12 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
If you"re seeking a lively canine companion who is fearless, yet affectionate, the Norfolk Terrier may be the breed for you. With a perky, outgoing personality, and tireless constitution, the 12-pound Norfolk charms those who know and love him. Never boring, and certainly no couch potato, he is all terrier--tenacious, independent, hard-working, and charming. The Norfolk is also incredibly cute. With small, dark eyes sparkling with mischief, and a scruffy, wiry coat, it"s difficult to resist his appeal. Norfolk Terriers have been known by different names over the years. They were called Cantab Terriers when Cambridge University students used to keep them as pets. They also have been called Trumpington Terriers, after a street in the area where the breed was developed. For a while, they were even called Jones Terriers, named after the man who first exported them to the United States. In 1932, the English Kennel Club called them Norwich Terriers because at the time, the Norwich and the Norfolk were considered the same breed. Norwich Terriers and Norfolk Terriers do look very much alike. The easiest way to tell them apart is by their ears: Norwich Terriers" are upright, and Norfolks" are folded. The Norfolk is relatively uncommon in the United States. Fewer than 300 puppies are born per year in America. Litters are small. So if you want a Norfolk, expect to wait up to one year. Even though the Norfolk is small, he is very strong. At 9 to 10 inches tall and weighing just 11 to 12 pounds, you might think this happy little canine is a lap dog who wants pampering. Far from it. While he is affectionate and loves his family, a Norfolk Terrier is always ready for the chase, whether it"s vermin or fox. Because of his courage and ability to scrap with the best of foes, the Norfolk is allowed "honor scars" in the show ring to attest to his field worthiness. Norfolk Terriers have steady, live-and-let-live personalities. They generally have a happy attitude and make a reliable companion for children if they"ve been raised with them. They"re not known for being yappy, but they will bark when the need arises. If left alone outside for long periods of time or not given enough exercise, however, the Norfolk will amuse himself by barking and digging. Give your playful Norfolk a lot of toys and activities to occupy his mind, or he will find his own entertainment. As with all terriers, Norfolks should be kept on leash when in public areas because their strong hunting instinct is easily triggered by the sight of a squirrel, rabbit, or other small animal dashing by. If you choose a Norfolk, be prepared to have him as a part of your family for a very long time. These are hardy dogs that have been known to live into their late teens, still active and happily playing with their toys.
The Norfolk Terrier can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is highly recommended. Norfolks are energetic dogs who like a lot of activity so make sure he"s included in the household action as much as possible. Do not allow a Norfolk off leash in unsecured areas because you never know when his instinct to chase will kick in. The Norfolk is not yappy, but he will bark if he thinks something is amiss or if he"s bored. The Norfolk is passionate about digging. Fencing should be sunk one foot deep and checked regularly for escape holes. Some Norfolk Terriers become obese if fed too much and exercised too little. Do not indulge his desire for more food. Don"t expect to call a Norfolk breeder Tuesday and buy a puppy on Thursday. You may have to wait as long as a year for one.
The Norfolk was originally bred to hunt and kill vermin in barns. Both the Norfolk, and the Norwich Terrier, were once both called Norwich Terriers, distinguished only by their ears--the Norwich"s pricked ones and the Norfolk"s dropped ones. The breed that would later come to be the Norfolk was developed in near the towns of Norfolk and Norwich in England in the early 1800s as a general farm dog and hunter. Many believe it was developed by crossing Border Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and Irish Terriers. In the late 19th century, the reputation of the small terriers as ratters grew. Students at Cambridge University brought some to help with their rat problems and the little dogs became known first as Cantab Terriers, and later as Trumpington Terriers. One of the early breeders of Norfolk/Norwich terriers was Jodrell Hopkins, a Cambridge student who had a livery stable on Trumpington Street after he graduated. Along with "Doggy" Lawrence, a Cambridge dog dealer, he bred and sold the lively little dogs to Cambridge students. At that time, most of the little terriers were red. Several breeders began to refine the breed: Frank Jones, who was responsible for giving the breed the name of Norwich, and R.J. Read, one of the first exporters of the breed and the first president of the Norwich Terrier Club in England. One of the dogs they used in their breeding program was a red dog named Rags, who belonged to Frank Jones" boss, Jack Cooke. Rags had been given to Cooke by Jodrell Hopkins, and he turned out to be a very dominant sire, siring red puppies like himself. Around the same time, the son of a Norwich veterinarian, Lewis Low (nicknamed "Podge") acquired a smooth-coated, prick-ear white female who was reportedly a hunt terrier/Dandie Dinmont cross. Her owners brought her to Low"s father to be destroyed, but Low liked her coat, long legs, erect ears, and what seemed to him to be an "old" expression, so he kept her and named her Ninety. Ninety was bred to Rags, and several of the puppies were bought by Frank Jones. When Jones left his employment with Cooke, he took his terriers with him and continued to breed and sell the small red dogs. He also sent some of them to America, calling them Jones Terriers until in 1904, when he was asked the name of the breed and impulsively answered, "Norwich Terriers." Jones and his employer at the time supplied many of the early breeders of Norwich Terriers with their foundation stock, both in England and America. Over the next several years, many breeders worked to perfect the breed, sometimes trying crosses with different breeds. One of these breeders is R.J. Read, who became interested in the breed around 1908. He purchased a Rags daughter from Podge Low in 1909 and experimented with cross-breeding with other breeds, such as the Bedlington Terrier, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the Irish Terrier. By 1929, he had finally bred the dog that he was trying to produce. It was a small red terrier, no more than 10 pounds when mature, with a harsh red coat, dark eyes, short legs, and gamey personality. The dog"s name was Horstead Mick, and his name appears in many of today"s pedigrees. Mick was used a great deal as a stud and was the grandsire of one of the Norwich Terrier"s first champions, a drop-ear female named Tinker Bell. Another influential breeder is Phyllis Fagan, who acquired a red female named Brownie. Many of today"s Norwich and Norfolk Terriers are descended from her dogs. She showed her dogs and they did quite well in the show ring, as well as in earth trials. The breed was officially recognized in the 1930s in both the United States and Great Britain. Within the breed were dogs with prick ears and drop ears. Until this time, both prick-ear and drop-ear dogs were interbred because they were considered to be the same breed. When the breed was recognized by the English Kennel Club, however, the ears became an issue. Read liked the prick ear and wanted the breed standard to insist that all dogs of this breed have this type of ear. Proponents of the drop-ear dogs insisted that standard include both. In the end, the advocates of the dropped ear won and the standard was written to include both. For a few years, breeders continued to breed dogs with prick ears to those with drop ears, but then the ear carriage became erratic in both types and breeders decided on their own that this was not a good idea. After World War II, breeders stopped interbreeding the two different types of dogs. In September 1964, England"s Kennel Club allowed separation of the prick-eared and the drop-ear dogs, with prick-ear dogs remaining Norwich Terriers and the drop-ear named Norfolk Terriers. In 1979, the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were recognized as separate breeds by the American Kennel Club. Aside from the ears, the breed standards are very similar.
Males and females are 9 to 10 inches tall, and weigh 11 to 12 pounds
The Norfolk has personality plus. Though small, he makes up for it with a buoyant, lively approach to life. He is active, alert, good natured, and always ready to play. The Norfolk is tireless in his pursuit of fun--which can be exhausting for you. Don"t expect the Norfolk to sit around when there"s something to investigate. This dog thrives on action so be prepared to provide it for him--or he"ll be bored and unhappy. The Norfolk is a typical terrier, meaning he"s independent and always ready to give chase. He"s prone to dig and bark, too--behaviors that come naturally to breeds bred to chase vermin that live in dens. These traits can be frustrating to owners who are either unprepared for the terrier personality, or just don"t enjoy it. If you"re okay with terriers, you"ll be delighted with the Norfolk"s lively, plucky attitude, and his devotion to family.
The Norfolk is generally a hearty dog. Like all breeds, though, the Norfolk is prone to some conditions. Mitral valve disease (MVD). MVD is a life-threatening heart abnormality that reputable Norfolk breeders are working to reduce or completely eradicate in the breed. Research is underway, but it may take many years for it to be completed. Meanwhile, dogs with MVD should not be bred, and all breeding dogs should be tested for the condition. Canine hip dysplasia. Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Vaccination sensitivity. There are reports of Norfolks suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. Sometimes a dog who is sensitive to vaccines will develop complications, or die. Watch your Norfolk carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.
The Norfolk is an easy-care dog. Because of his small size, he"s well-suited to apartment living--though he can get barky if bored. He needs at least one 20 to 30 minute vigorous walk or play session, or two 10 to 15 minute sessions every day. This dog is intelligent and enjoys learning. But his natural independence and occasional stubborness can make training challenging at times. Consistent, positive training is the best way to convince him to do what you ask. Teaching the Norfolk to come reliably when called is especially important in case he accidentally comes unleashed. Don"t ever yell or use physical force with these dogs--they"re highly sensitive and may become fearful or agitated as a result. Like many terriers, the Norfolk barks. While he"s not overly noisy, a "Quiet" command should become part of his basic canine repertoire. One word of caution: the Norfolk, like many other earth dogs, enjoys, no, loves, digging and this trait is not as easy to deter as barking.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s been said that the Norfolk will eat anything that doesn"t eat him first. Not surprisingly, he"s prone to obesity. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Norfolk, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Norfolk Terrier has a double coat that consists of a soft, downy undercoat and a wiry top coat. The coat is weather-resistant, and sheds minimally. The Norfolk coat comes in shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle. The fur around the neck and shoulders is longer, and forms a ruff at the base of the ears and throat. The hair on the ears and head is short and smooth, except for eyebrows and whiskers. The shaggy, unkempt look of the Norfolk is part of his appeal. He does require some grooming, though. His coat should be brushed one or twice a week, toenails trimmed regularly, and ears cleaned or checked weekly. Frequent tooth brushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste help prevent gum disease. Monthly bathing is needed. More than that may soften the coarse terrier coat. The Norfolk coat is not usually trimmed with clippers like other breeds, but shortened or shaped by stripping, a process by which coat is thinned and shortened with a stripping knife, a sharp, comb-like tool. Stripping is common practice for owners with show dogs, but not necessary for a family pet.
The Norfolk is good with children, and makes a good family pet. He is best suited to families with children age 10 and older because they"re less likely to accidentally step on or hurt him, due to his small size. Because the good-natured Norfolk is less apt to quarrel with other dogs than some terriers, he lives happily in a household with other dogs. He is not well suited, however, for a home with small animals. Unable to curb his natural instinct, he"ll chase hamsters, gerbils, birds, and any other animal he perceives as prey.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 4 inches to 1 foot, 6 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  26 to 40 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The Norwegian Buhund hails from Norway, where he was responsible for herding livestock and guarding the farm. He has a trait that"s rare among the Spitz breeds: a desire to please. Add in his intelligence and independence, and you get a highly trainable and capable dog. He can handle jobs ranging from hearing dog, to police dog, to competitor in agility and obedience trials. His alert nature and tendency to bark make him a good watchdog, although he"s probably too friendly to pose any real threat.This is an active — some say tireless — breed who needs a lot of vigorous exercise and playtime daily. He"s highly affectionate with his family, including the kids, and enjoys a cuddle on the couch as well as a romp in the park. Kind, consistent training is essential for this smart dog, as is family involvement. He won"t want to be left out of anything!

Dog Breed Group:  Hound DogsHeight:  1 foot, 7 inches to 1 foot, 8 inches tall at the shoulderLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The Norwegian Elkhound was originally used to hunt moose and other big game. The name of this ancient breed is a complete misnomer; they weren"t meant to hunt elk, and they aren"t hounds. In Norwegian, Norsk Elghund means "moose dog," and in German, elch means "moose" — probably part of the reason for the confusion in English. Linguistic history aside, the Elkhound has phenomenal stamina. While hunting, he would jump forward and back and around the moose, bear, or wolf, keeping it in one place and barking nonstop until the hunter arrived. While most people who live with a Norwegian Elkhound today don"t hunt outside the refrigerator, think about his fearless and active noisemaking strategy before you choose to bring an Elkhound into your life. Norwegian Elkhounds are known for barking, and although the trait can be trained out of some, you can"t bet on it. What this background means to the average dog owner is that exacting obedience work just isn"t in the picture. He"ll be fine in basic obedience and he makes a great family dog, but understand clearly that pleasing you is not the highest item on his to-do list. This is no Golden Retriever, so go get your own slippers. Toys are generally of no interest. He loves chasing balls, but you can forget about him bringing them back to you. That"s what happens when you share your heart and home with an independent thinker. He"ll want something in return for obedience work — which he sees as pointless — and you can forget a pat on the head as his reward. If you want to motivate your Elkhound in training and form a partnership, you"d better have a steady supply of treats on hand. Once an Elkhound bonds to you, though, you"ll be an inseparable pair as far as he"s concerned. Norwegian Elkhounds are strong-willed enough that they can take over a home if they"re allowed half a chance. They love the dominant role, and without proper training and socialization, this can become a problem. Training can be difficult, and they need a firm and consistent owner. Naturally, they prefer a winter climate with lots of snow to play in. A true adventurer, the Elkhound wants his adventure to occur outdoors. Long daily exercise is a necessity, so if you"re not ready to turn your couch potato ways into those of an outdoorsman, think twice — if you can"t keep up, you"ll soon be met with a house full of destroyed belongings that met their fates as he found ways to expend his endless energy. Not surprisingly, the Elkhound excels at fast-moving performance events such as agility. Once he"s outside, the Elkhound may see game he just has to track, and he"ll likely choose to ignore your calls for his return. Thanks to their strong prey drive, Elkhounds may even chase their quarry through plate-glass windows; and while they were bred to track but not attack game, they have been known to kill game on their own. That said, Norwegian Elkhounds are affectionate dogs who make devoted, wonderful family members. They"re excellent with children and are terrific watch dogs, treating strangers with natural suspicion. They thrive on attention, and it"s hard to find a more loyal companion.
The Norwegian Elkhound is loyal and affectionate, and he does very well with children and is generally friendly with strangers. However, he can be aggressive to other dogs and animals, so it"s important to properly socialize your Elkhound from puppyhood to a variety of new experiences and dogs. The Elkhound can be dominant and difficult to train, but training can nonetheless be enjoyable and effective as long as the approach is consistent and firm. Being a working breed, the Elkhound has a level of intelligence, independence, and energy that can be overwhelming for timid or inconsistent owners. You should expect him to need at least 30 minutes of exercise twice per day, which will also fight this food-motivated dog"s tendency toward obesity. He"ll also need some form of mental stimulation to keep him from becoming bored. The Norwegian Elkhound does fine in apartments if he"s properly exercised, but the ideal setting is a large, fenced yard. Despite his outdoor hardiness, he needs to live indoors with his family. He can be a barker, which you should keep in mind before bringing one home. Although some Elkhounds can be trained to not bark, this is not the norm. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Norwegian Elkhound originated in the breathtakingly beautiful and rugged country of Norway. He can be traced back roughly a thousand years, where a breed of dog similar in shape and size was used by the Vikings to guard and hunt. It"s possible that the breed may reach back as far as 5000 BCE, since alongside other artifacts from a primitive culture, archaeologists have found skeletons of dogs greatly resembling the shape of the Norwegian Elkhound. Although its exact history is lost in time, there"s little doubt that this breed is closely intertwined with the history of mankind. The Norwegian Elkhound has been a common fixture in the history of not only the Vikings but of Norwegian culture in general. The breed has been used to guard herds, flocks, and homes; and to hunt large game such as bear and moose. His role in hunting was to first track down his prey and then to hold it at bay by barking until the hunter could arrive to kill the animal. The Norwegian Elkhound became a breed of interest after the Norwegian Hunters Association held its first dog show in 1877. Shortly thereafter, breeders began an effort to create a breed standard and records, and to also shape the Norwegian Elkhound into a serious competitor in the conformation ring. Today, the Norwegian Elkhound makes a wonderful family companion and does well in a variety of dog sports and careers, including conformation, agility, obedience, flyball, freestyle, tracking, guarding, herding, sledding, and search and rescue. Norwegian Elkhounds are still used in their original capacity as hunting dogs as well.
The Norwegian Elkhound is a medium-sized dog, averaging 20.5 inches in height. Males average 55 pounds; females 48 pounds.
Independent thinkers, these extroverted clowns like to be where the action is. They see themselves as coexisting with you — not necessarily underneath you in the chain of command. They can be hard to train because of that independence, but they can get it if you"re firm and consistent. If you"re not a firm person, however, this dog will walk all over you. And while consistency is critical, harsh training methods don"t work well. Amazingly devoted, he"s protective if not outright possessive of his family. Attached and loyal, he"s happiest to be with you all the time and dotes on your attention and interaction. A born watchdog but not aggressive by nature, his bark provides a level of safety from intruders. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Elkhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Elkhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Elkhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Elkhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Elkhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Fanconi Syndrome: This is a serious, inherited disease that affects the kidneys and the tubules that reabsorb substances. This leads to improper levels of calcium, glucose, phosphate, sodium and amino acids. Symptoms, which usually begin with excessive urination and thirst, can occur between the ages of one to seven years. As the disease progresses and the kidneys begin to fail, symptoms include weight loss, muscle wasting, muscle pain, lethargy, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Untreated, the disease is fatal. If caught early and treated with appropriate management, affected dogs can do well. Management includes medication, change in diet, and a constant supply of fresh water. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It"s treated with medication and diet. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Sebaceous Cysts: These are follicular cysts that form under the dog"s skin. They can range in size from small to as large as a walnut, and they will occasionally burst open, expelling a thick, white cheesy mass. Surgical removal is the usual treatment.
The Norwegian Elkhound requires daily exercise (breeders recommend 30 minutes twice a day), not only to burn off energy but also to help him maintain a healthy weight. Exceptionally food-motivated, he can become obese (look out for those huge, soulful brown eyes aimed at your dinner), and proper feeding and exercise are required throughout his life. He does all right in apartments, but he is a barker, so take that into consideration. A home with a fenced yard is more suitable. He could live outside because he"s so hardy, but he"d much rather be indoors with you. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Elkhound doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Elkhound accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Elkhound in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night (if that"s where he sleeps — he"s going to prefer to be in your bed with you). Elkhounds are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Remember that Elkhounds are highly motivated by food and can turn into accomplished beggars. So if you can"t resist sneaking him scraps from the table, and if you can"t provide the high level of exercise he requires, you could find yourself with an obese dog. Keep your Elkhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Elkhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
A Northern breed, the Elkhound has a double coat that sheds dirt and is weather-resistant. The topcoat is short and thick and lies smooth. The undercoat is dense, woolly and soft to the touch. The Elkhound is usually medium gray with black-tipped guard hairs accented by a lot of light silver. Typically there"s a darker gray coloring on the saddle, and black tipping on the ears and tail. His chest and mane are a lighter gray. The Elkhound is shown in conformation in a natural state, without any trimming. Most of the year he doesn"t shed too much, but two or three times a year he "blows coat" and sheds like crazy. He requires weekly brushing, possibly more when shedding; but his coat is fairly easy to maintain. If you like a fastidiously clean house, however, another breed would be a better choice. The Norwegian Elkhound tends to be a clean breed in terms of his coat, which naturally expels debris (usually onto your couch or clothing). He generally doesn"t smell too doggish and requires baths only when absolutely necessary. When you do bathe him, it"s important to use a high-quality dog shampoo. Brush your Elkhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Elkhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
An Elkhound is excellent with children and will play with and protect them. However, without careful obedience training, they may take over the role of pack leader and become dominant, especially toward children, less strong-willed adults, or other dogs. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Norwegian Elkhound generally gets along with other pets, including cats, but remember his prey drive and willingness to hunt big game.

Also known as the puffin dog, this unique and acrobatic canine was discovered on a remote island in Norway, where he was used to scale cliffs and rob puffin nests of their eggs. With six toes on each foot, including two large, functional dewclaws, and an exceptional range of motion in his joints, he can climb just about anywhere in your house or yard and squirm through the narrowest of passageways. Heck, you might even see one trying his paw at Half Dome someday. Cheerful, inquisitive, and mischievous, this is a dog who needs close supervision to keep him out of trouble. He"s a primitive breed who"s difficult to housetrain and loves to bark and dig, so keep that in mind before deciding that it would be really cool to have a dog who can bend his head backwards, splay his front legs out to the side, and close his ears to keep out moisture and dirt. Provide him with plenty of early socialization to prevent shyness and noise sensitivity. And if you"re a bird lover, well, just keep in mind this breed"s original purpose.

The Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest of all the terriers, but what he lacks in size, he makes up for in personality and drive. This active terrier is a wonderful companion for an active individual or family. His name gives you a clue to his appearance and helps you tell him apart from his sibling, the Norfolk Terrier: remember that the Norwich has prick ears that stand up like a witch"s hat. The Norwich Terrier was once used for hunting both vermin and foxes, and today he can still be seen hunting in a variety of places. Norwich Terriers are a working breed and are happiest when they have a job to do such as attending obedience class and practicing at home or participating in various dog sports. The Norwich successfully competes in obedience and agility trials, rally, and earthdog trials. You can see the drive of the Norwich Terrier in his day-to-day life: chasing squirrels and other rodents, bolting out doors and gates if unrestrained, and digging and barking for entertainment. These terrier habits can make him unsuited for the person or family who can"t ensure these behaviors don"t become a nuisance. On the plus side, he"s loyal and alert, qualities that make him an excellent watchdog. Norwich Terriers are courageous, but they should never be aggressive. The breed is known for its loving and well-balanced nature and thrives on the companionship of the humans it loves. If you can cope with his high prey drive and tendencies to bark and dig, the Norwich Terrier is a wonderful companion and friend who may surprise you with his versatility and athleticism.
Norwich Terriers have a high prey drive and should never be trusted off leash when they"re not in a fenced area. Norwich Terriers require at least two long walks per day to keep them fit and to help them expel excess energy. They make excellent walking companions. Norwich Terriers must have a fenced yard because they will chase any animal they deem as "prey." Underground electronic fencing is not adequate for Norwich Terriers because they tend to ignore the shock. Norwich Terriers can be difficult to housetrain and although they"re eager to please, training can be difficult when not properly motivated. Be patient, stick to a regular schedule, reward them with praise and treats when they potty outdoors, and crate them when you can"t supervise them indoors. Norwich Terriers can coexist with other dogs and cats, but the breed will generally classify any rabbits, gerbils, or other small rodents as prey. They are not a good match for homes where small pets are allowed to roam free. Barking is often an indicator that your Norwich Terrier sees something suspicious, is bored, or hasn"t had his exercise needs met. The breed is not known for being overly yappy but there are exceptions to every rule and every Norwich Terrier will bark if the above occurs. Norwich Terriers can live in apartments if they"re given plenty of exercise (of course this can be said of most dogs). The Norwich Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging. Bear in mind it"s easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area then it is to break him of his digging habit. The Norwich is a rare and therefore expensive breed. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Norwich Terrier is one of the younger breeds in existence today and shares his history with the Norfolk Terrier. In fact, the Norfolk Terrier was considered the drop-ear variety of the Norwich Terrier until 1964 when the British Kennel Club separated the prick ear and the drop ear into two different breeds. Before that time, however, the Norwich Terrier was a breed that rarely had a standard--a written description of the breed--that puppies were bred to. The breed originated in England, and several breeds may have contributed to its development, including the Irish Terrier. Between 1899 and 1902, a brindle-colored mixed-breed female was bred to a "Cantab Terrier." The resulting puppies were called Trumpington terriers, and one of them, "Rags," became the founding sire of the Norwich Terrier breed, being bred with various Trumpington terriers and Glen of Imaal terriers. For a time, they were known as Jones terriers, after Frank Jones, who was instrumental in developing them. The Norwich Terrier moved with Frank Jones to the United States and found use as not only a hunter of vermin but also as a terrier who could work alongside Foxhounds. The Norwich Terrier was used to flush foxes Foxhounds couldn"t get to because they"d gone into their dens. It didn"t take long for the Norwich Terrier to become known in the United States and many were imported into the US and used by American hunters for foxhunting. In 1979, the AKC followed the lead already set by England"s Kennel Club in 1964 and split the varieties into two different breeds: the drop-eared dog became the Norfolk Terrier and the prick-eared dog remained the Norwich Terrier.
Standing 10 inches high at the shoulders and weighing roughly 12 pounds for both males and females, the Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest of the terrier breeds. He should look stocky but not overweight.
The Norwich Terrier is known for his affectionate nature. He generally loves everyone and will do well in households with multiple pets and children. His sensitive intelligence and alert nature ensure that he"ll bark an alarm if he spots anything or anyone suspicious near his home. Norwich Terriers have a mind of their own, but they generally enjoy life and enjoy pleasing both themselves and their owners. They are small, but that doesn"t mean you should overindulge or coddle them. That simply leads to behavior problems. The Norwich is active and loves playing with balls and toys or just playing a good game with the people he loves. He thrives on the companionship of humans and will fit himself into your life completely. Like every dog, Norwich Terriers need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Norwich Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Norwich Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Norwich Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Tracheal Collapse: Tracheal collapse is often seen in small breed such as the Norwich. It is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings, which flatten until finally obstructing the airway. Signs of tracheal collapse include coughing that sounds like a goose honk, fainting, and an inability to exercise for long periods. It is treated medically with antibiotics, steroids, and cough suppressants. You may be advised to walk your dog with a harness rather than a collar to reduce pressure on his neck. If medical treatment doesn"t work, surgery is recommended. Elongated Soft Palate: The soft palate is the extension of the roof of the mouth. When the soft palate is elongated, it can obstruct the airway and cause difficulty in breathing. The treatment for Elongated Soft Palate is surgical removal of the excess palate. Epilepsy: The Norwich Terrier can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated by medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Norwich Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Norwich Terrier is an intelligent working dog. He"s happiest when he has a job to do. Training can be fairly easy with this breed as long you provide clear and consistent rules and training. Making a training session interesting rather than repetitive is another way to keep the Norwich Terrier engaged and interested in learning. Housetraining can be a challenge and may take a significant amount of time and patience. Use a crate to prevent accidents in the home. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Norwich doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Never stick your Norwich in a crate all day long, however. Norwich Terriers are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Norwich Terriers require daily exercise and like many terrier breeds they have an ample supply of energy. They make wonderful walking companions, and their exercise requirements can be met with a couple of vigorous 10- or 15-minute walks per day or playtime in a fenced area. It"s important that a Norwich Terrier remain on lead when he"s not in a fenced area or his strong desire to chase can cause him to run right in front of a car. Although the Norwich Terrier is known to bark, he can live in an apartment if his stimulation and exercise needs are met.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s been said that the Norwich will eat anything that doesn"t eat him first. Not surprisingly, he"s prone to obesity. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Norwich, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Norwich Terrier wears a hard, wiry, straight topcoat over a soft, downy, insulating undercoat. The hair on his neck and shoulders forms a protective mane. Small dark eyes twinkle beneath slight eyebrows. The hair on the rest of his head, including the ears and muzzle, is short. The Norwich coat can be any shade of red, grizzle (a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs), wheaten (pale yellow or fawn), or black and tan. Like all breeds, Norwich Terriers shed, though not as much as some. Brush them weekly to remove dead hair. Regular brushing will keep your Norwich clean. He won"t need frequent baths unless he rolls in something stinky. Stripping the coat twice a year--pulling out the dead topcoat by hand or with the aid of a stripping tool--maintains the coat"s characteristic hard texture. Without stripping, your Norwich will look a little scruffy, and he"ll shed more than he would otherwise. If you clip your Norwich"s coat instead of stripping it, the color and texture changes, becoming lighter and softer and more prone to shedding. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Norwich"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Small breeds such as the Norwich are especially prone to severe gingivitis. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Norwich enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Norwich accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Norwich Terriers are known for their love of everyone, and this includes children. They do much better in homes with children if they are raised with them. An adult Norwich who"s unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Norwich Terriers also do very well with other dogs and tend to have no issues with other canine pets. They can adjust to living with cats but they need to be properly socialized to them to do so.
Norwich Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and fostering. Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club

Frolicking at the water"s edge, white-tipped tail flashing in the sunlight, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever dances in the waves. Curious ducks and other waterfowl draw closer to watch his performance, when a hunter takes aim and fires. That"s when this remarkable dog shows he"s not simply a harmless goofball but a hardworking gun dog. He splashes into the water to retrieve the bounty he helped attract.The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a rare breed that originated in the Little River district of Nova Scotia, a province on Canada"s Atlantic coast. Originally known as Little River Duck Dogs, they were renamed the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever — a mouthful, even for a retriever, so most fans call them Tollers.This sporting breed has a lot going for it: personality, versatility, and an easy-care coat. They"re the smallest of all the retriever breeds and share many of the same traits, such as a strong working drive, intelligence, and a happy nature. But the breed has some drawbacks as well. They can be strong willed and are not as eager to please as a Labrador or Golden Retriever. If allowed to, they will take control of a household.They need to be guided by people who are firm, fair, and consistent. Even then they can be inventive in getting their way. With training, however, that intelligence and inventiveness can be channeled into almost any activity.They"re best suited to life with a weekend hunter or an active family who enjoys hiking or participating in dog sports, such as agility, flyball, and Frisbee.Tollers love kids. They"re great for playing ball or pulling a child on a skateboard. They get along well with other dogs, especially other Tollers. Their prey drive, however, may send them careening after cats or other animals that look like good sport.You"ll need a fenced yard if you have a Toller or be able to give him at least two good walks a day. That said, his activity level is moderate, and he doesn"t have the drive and intensity of, say, a Lab or a Border Collie.One hitch to living with a Toller in the city is the breed"s loud, high-pitched scream, which can make him unacceptable in apartments and neighborhoods with noise restrictions. The Toller yelps out when he"s stimulated, excited, or frustrated. Often, the sight of birds or squirrels elicits the scream. Other than that, however, they don"t tend to bark excessively.So he screams, sheds, likes to roll in dead fish and other stinky things, and is generally smarter than the average person. If these things concern you, look for another breed.On the other hand, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is an ideal dog if you are looking for a fun-loving, hard-working dog who enjoys long periods of exercise, and being with family. What is tolling?You can"t mention the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever without wondering what exactly "tolling" means. The word toller comes from the Middle English word tollen, meaning "to entice." Tolling is the act of luring game and it"s exactly what the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever does.While the hunter remains behind a blind, out of sight of ducks and other waterfowl, the dog plays at the water"s edge, romping and retrieving. These antics draw the attention of the birds, who swim closer to shore. When the birds are close enough, the Toller retreats to the blind, the hunter stands, scaring the birds into flight, and then fires. The Toller then swims out and retrieves any fallen birds.
Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are generally healthy, but because of the limited gene pool, some diseases have begun to occur. His red coat and flesh-colored nose mean the Toller may have a higher incidence of immune-mediated disease. Although he has a medium length coat, the Toller"s coat is fairly low maintenance and easy to care for. Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are moderately active sporting dogs and need roughly an hour a day of exercise. If not properly exercised, they will expend their energy in less positive ways, such as chewing and digging. Tollers have a strong prey drive that will prompt them to chase cats or other small animals they see outdoors. Keep your Toller in a fenced yard to prevent him from running after prey. If you live in an apartment, or noise controlled neighborhood, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever may not be the dog for you. When he"s excited, he"s likely to emit a scream that"s loud, high-pitched, and nerve wracking. If you prefer a clean and tidy dog, the Toller may not be the breed for you. He sheds seasonally and enjoys rolling and frolicking in mud and dirt. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is not a miniature Golden Retriever; their temperaments are quite different. The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a rare breed and it may take time to locate a reputable breeder who has puppies available. Expect a wait of six months to a year or more for a puppy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The original Tollers were foxes. Canada"s Micmac Indians observed foxes performing tolling behavior on the shores of rivers and lakes, then snatching the ducks foolish enough to come too close. The Micmacs encouraged this behavior in their own dogs, who also learned to lure the inquisitive ducks.In the 19th century, hunters in England and Canada began to develop dogs who"d go into the water to bring back downed birds. These retrievers, as they were called, bore the names of the places where they were developed, such as Labrador and Chesapeake Bay.But the hunters in Yarmouth County in southwest Nova Scotia"s Little River district went one step further. They created a dog who would attract birds as well as retrieve them. Starting with the Micmac Indian dogs, they mixed a little of this and that, skillfully blending in various other retriever breeds, Cocker Spaniels, Irish Setters, and maybe even farm collies. The result became known as the Little River Duck Dog.For years, the Little River Duck Dog was known only in the area where he was developed. But in 1945 the Canadian Kennel Club gave the breed recognition, as well as a new name: Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.The breed first came to the United States in the 1960s, but didn"t garner much interest. By 1984, however, the breed had enough fans that the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Club USA was formed. The American Kennel Club accepted the breed in the Miscellaneous Class in 2001 and into the Sporting Group in 2003.Today the Toller ranks 110th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males stand 18 to 21 inches tall at the shoulder with an ideal height of 19 inches. Females are 17 to 20 inches, with the ideal height being 18 inches. Weight is in proportion to height and generally ranges from 35 to 50 pounds.
Tollers are smart, independent, and curious. Their personality lies somewhere between that of a Golden Retriever and a terrier. It"s not unusual for them to have a sense of humor, and they generally have an outgoing, upbeat attitude.When not working or playing, they"re content to lie down and be quiet. Adults are typically gentle dogs, particularly with children.Tollers are adaptable, moving from one environment to another with ease, and tolerant of crate training and travel. They can be standoffish toward strangers, but they take their cues from their people. If you"re friendly toward someone, your Toller will be, too.Tollers watch everything that"s going on and will alert you if someone is approaching your home. They usually get along well with other animals, although aggression is occasionally a problem. That"s not typical for the breed, however.As with every dog, Tollers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Establish yourself as the benevolent leader, rather than the harsh dictator, and your Toller should take well to training.
Tollers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Tollers will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Collie Eye Anomaly: Although Collie eye is usually seen in Collie breeds, it has been seen in the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever in the last several years. Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and is diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies. Deafness: A few lines of Tollers appear to be prone to deafness. It tends to develop late in life, between 7 and 8 years of age.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tollers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
The Toller does best living in a home with access to a securely fenced yard. He can, however, live happily in a city highrise as long as he gets a couple of daily walks. There are Tollers in the country and Tollers who live in apartments and are paper-trained to potty on the balcony.Toller puppies are born yipping and running around, or at least it seems that way. During their first year, they"re highly active, but eventually their activity level tapers to a more manageable level.Like any dog, Tollers can be destructive as puppies if not properly supervised. Crate training is recommended. Adults can be destructive as well if they don"t get the exercise they need.A tired Toller is a good Toller. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise per day. He"ll enjoy a couple of 30-minute walks or runs, a 30-minute walk and 30 minutes of playing fetch, a hike of an hour or two, or any other combination of exercise the two of you can do together. And this dog likes to swim.To keep his feet in good condition, walk your Toller on rough ground once in a while. This helps keep the foot pads tight so they don"t pick up a lot of debris that could damage the foot.To protect puppies as they grow, monitor their activity and don"t let them overdo things. A good rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every month of age, so limit a 6-month-old puppy to 30 minutes of play or other exercise throughout the day.When it comes to training, be firm but gentle with your Toller, as well as creative, patient, and flexible. You must be able to earn his trust and respect without using anger, intimidation, or physical force. With this breed, harshness begets stubbornness, and you don"t want to get into a battle of wills with a Toller. You"ll lose. Set firm rules, enforce them consistently, and don"t let your Toller get bored.Train him with a light touch, however. He doesn"t perform well under pressure. But when he"s motivated by praise, play, and food rewards, the Toller learns quickly and easily.He shouldn"t be difficult to housetrain, given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Toller in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Toller, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Toller has a medium-length, water-repellent double coat. The red or orange color gives him a foxlike appearance, even giving rise to the tale that he"s the result of a fox-retriever cross, a genetic impossibility.He may have white markings on his feet, chest, face, or tail tip. A white tail tip is especially desirable because it allows the hunter to keep the dog in sight from a distance. The tail itself should be full and bushy, never trimmed and sculpted. Nose, lips, and eye rims are black or flesh-colored, blending with the coat.This is a wash-and-go dog. Throughout most of the year, the coat requires only weekly brushing to keep the fur from matting and to remove dead hair. During the spring and fall shedding seasons, daily brushing may be necessary.Otherwise, simply keep the nails trimmed, clean and trim the foot pads, and pluck around the ears if they"re particularly hairy. Bathe as needed.At some point during puppyhood, usually at three to four months of age, your Toller"s ears may go wonky, folding back instead of framing the face. The ears may need to be taped to regain the correct position. Your Toller"s breeder can show you how.Brush your Toller"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin getting your Toller accustomed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Tollers love kids and make good playmates for active older children who"ll play ball with them, teach them tricks, and otherwise keep them occupied. They may be too rambunctious for very young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tollers enjoy the company of other dogs and get along just fine with cats, especially if they"re raised with them.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  From 1 foot, 9 inches tall at the shoulderLife Span:  10 to 12 years
The wonderfully shaggy Old English Sheepdog is a favorite in children"s television shows and movies, where he"s usually an affable, if sometimes bumbling, character. But, hair and Hollywood glitz aside, who is the OES?In reality, the OES — nicknamed "Bobtail" because of his docked tail (traditionally kept short to identify him as a drover) — is an easygoing, fun-loving, intelligent dog. He"s a member of the American Kennel Club Herding Group. He"s certainly a large dog at 60 to 100 pounds, but his profuse coat of blue-gray and white makes him appear even larger. Known for his wonderful temperament, he"s powerful, sturdy, and hardworking.Those who know and love him are familiar with his sense of humor. He can be playful and comical, although he is also the guardian and protector of his family.You can"t talk about the OES without talking about hair, a lot of hair. This coat needs more care than most. It"s long and prone to matting if not regularly brushed. Many owners clip the hair short — but if he is to be a show dog, the OES cannot be trimmed short.Expect three to four hours of grooming per week — perhaps more — plus monthly visits to a grooming salon. Not surprisingly, a common reason that OES owners surrender their dogs to rescue organizations is because of the time and cost of caring for the coat. Anyone considering this breed must think long and hard about grooming and related care.The OES is highly adaptable. To some people"s surprise, he does well in an apartment if he is exercised regularly. In spite of his working heritage, he is not a good candidate for a backyard dog. He wants to be, and should be, with his family, and he can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too long. He is trainable and responds well to a firm owner who is kind and consistent. He gets along well with other dogs and pets.With his shaggy coat, keen mind, and bobbed tail, the OES is a great addition to any family with the time and patience to care for him.
Training and proper socialization is essential for Old English Sheepdogs. They are large, bouncy and enthusiastic, but when they are young they can be especially rowdy. Patient, consistent training is must. Old English Sheepdogs are not for clean freaks. They tend to drool and are heavy shedders. Also, their heavy coats trap debris and dirt, which ends up on your furniture and floor. Originally bred for driving cattle and sheep, the OES is an active breed that requires a lot of exercise. The Old English Sheepdog coat is high maintenance. Keeping it clean and tangle-free is time-consuming and expensive. Separation anxiety is common in Old English Sheepdogs. They live for their families, and they can become destructive if they"re left alone too much. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
Without a doubt, the Old English Sheepdog has one of the canine world"s most unclear origins. There is evidence that the breed originated in the southwestern counties of England somewhere in the early 19th century, though it may owe its origins to the Scottish Bearded Collie or the Russian Owtchar, or some other dog altogether.At the time of the breed"s suspected origins, writings described a dog that was used to drive cattle and sheep to market. Owners docked their tails to prove that they were indeed drovers" dogs, and commonly nicknamed them "Bob" or "Bobtail."The OES became prominent in the late 1880s when he came to the United States, where he was first owned by a Pittsburgh industrialist named W. Wade. By the 1900s, the breed was owned, exhibited, and bred by just five wealthy U.S. families. This prompted one show superintendent to advise the judges at the 1904 Westminster Show in New York to "take plenty of time; the dogs in the ring are the property of some of our leading Americans."In 1904, Henry Arthur Tilley founded the Old English Sheepdog Club of America. Tilley and his brother, William Steeds Tilley, were pioneers in creating the OES breed standard. Many of the dogs that they bred can be found in the pedigrees of OES lines today.The American Kennel Club recognized the Old English Sheepdog in 1885. As late as the 1950s, the OES still maintained his status as a rich man"s dog. By the 1960s, however, the breed had moved from being a status symbol to a family pet. By the mid 1970s, 15,000 dogs were registered annually; but that number has declined as more people have realized the cost and effort needed to care for wonderful but time-consuming OES coat.
Males stand 22 inches tall and weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Females stand 21 inches tall and weigh 60 to 85 pounds.
The Old English Sheepdog is a playful, affectionate clown who delights in frolicking with his family and neighborhood children. In fact, adolescence in the OES often extends to about age three, and an adult OES will retain his playful demeanor well into his golden years.An intelligent breed, the OES is a quick learner, always looking for something interesting and fun to do. He"s capable of performing numerous tasks, including herding, agility, obedience, and search and rescue.This breed requires significant physical and mental exercise. He doesn"t enjoy being left alone for long periods of time and much prefers — in fact needs — to be in the company of his family.A properly bred OES is good-natured and kind, and this is what makes him an excellent children"s companion and a super family dog. He"s sometimes called a nanny, a term of endearment that arises from stories surrounding the role he sometimes takes on within his family.However, the OES is not known for being an assertive watchdog. He may bark when strangers come to his home — or he may not. Some OESs are highly protective, while others aren"t.
Old English Sheepdogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Old English Sheepdogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Canine hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, however, arthritis can develop. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland. A mild symptom of the disease may be infertility. More apparent signs are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, and irregular heat cycles. The fur becomes coarse and brittle and falls out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism is treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires lifelong treatment. Deafness is fairly common and can provide many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and the dog. If your dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for him properly.
Because of his working origins, the OES likes activity. Today"s Old English Sheepdogs are very capable participants in sheepherding and agility trials, both of which demand a healthy and physically fit dog. Figure on one to two hours of daily exercise as part of the OES routine.Of course, your dog"s needs will vary according to age. Pups have a lot of energy — so much so that they will use it to destroy your home if they aren"t kept busy with approved activities. On the other hand, older dogs may prefer to lie on the couch (taking up all of it) and need encouragement to exercise. It"s important to note that while the OES can readily adjust to less exercise, this isn"t particularly healthy for him.However, cut back on outdoor exercise when the weather is hot. The dense undercoat of the OES is extremely warm, and the dog can overheat quickly and easily.Obedience training is encouraged for all dogs, but especially for a large breed like the OES. The basic commands ("sit," "down," "come," and "stay") are important for everyday living with any dog, but add a wet and muddy OES coat in the mix, and you"ll realize that these commands are crucial. Luckily, the OES is very intelligent and learns quickly.The OES does not always take confinement well, so if you crate train your OES puppy, must make sure that you do not leave him in the crate too long. He should be out with you when you are home; the OES is sensitive to being shut off from the family he loves.During his first year, the OES grows from 1 pound to 60. When fully grown, he may weigh as much as 100 pounds. Due to this rapid growth, especially between the ages of four and seven months, they are susceptible to bone disorders. Take care to feed your OES puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast.Additionally, he shouldn"t run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement; normal play on grass is fine. Forced jumping or jogging on hard surfaces should be avoided until the dog is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed (puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps, are fine).
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Overfeeding an OES is especially easy to do because the fluffy coat readily hides extra pounds. It is extremely important that you check your dog"s weight regularly and take care not to overfeed him.For more on feeding your Old English Sheepdog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
If you want a dog with big hair, the Old English Sheepdog is the one for you. This breed has hair galore: a profuse, shaggy coat that is neither straight nor curly. The breed has a double coat, with a textured outer coat and soft undercoat. Colors include gray, grizzle, blue or blue merle, brown, and fawn, usually mixed with white markings.If you want a grooming challenge, try the OES. His coat is difficult to maintain; you will spend a minimum of three to four hours a week grooming him. If you"re new to the world of dogs, you"ll need help learning how to brush and comb your OES. The breeder can be helpful, and there are many quality grooming books and (better yet) videos on the market aimed at helping pet owners with this task.The OES is a heavy shedder and requires daily brushing to remove dead hair and keep the coat free of tangles.Some Old English Sheepdogs drool so much that the coat around their mouths turns yellow. If this happens, a regular washing, especially after meals, will help. Another method is to apply cornstarch to the beard. Once the cornstarch has completely dried, brush it out. This also works well when an OES has diarrhea.As with all breeds, it is important to begin grooming the OES puppy at an early age. Making grooming a positive and soothing experience will ensure easier handling, both for you and for professional groomers, as your OES puppy grows into adulthood.You"ll need to invest in a few tools to brush and comb your OES: a pin brush, coarse steel comb, and a slicker brush. Brushing should be a gentle process to avoid pulling and hurting the dog. It is important to always brush all the way to the skin, not just the top layer of coat, to remove any debris or hair that"s trapped in the undercoat. One tip for brushing is to spray the dog lightly with a detangler and/or conditioner before you brush.Mats are a real danger for the OES, and they can lead to skin problems. They"re extremely difficult to remove and, in severe cases of matting, the dog will need to be shaved.Besides brushing and combing out the coat, the OES needs bathing every six to eight weeks. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe the ears out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner. Regular toothbrushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste will help prevent dental disease.Many owners opt to have a professional groomer keep the OES coat in good condition (in addition to the regular brushing they perform themselves). This is expensive, and you must consider the cost when you think about buying an OES.
The well-bred and well-socialized Old English Sheepdog is a trustworthy children"s companion. Some say he will supervise and herd young children, keeping them in a particular area. Others say the OES acts as a means of support to the toddler learning to walk.Unfortunately, there are some exceptions to the Old English Sheepdog"s role as a loving nanny, due to poor breeding that has resulted in ill-tempered and neurotic dogs. Buy only from a reputable breeder and ask to meet the puppy"s parents. And it is extremely important to note that children should never be left unsupervised with any dog, regardless of breed or temperament.The good-natured OES is friendly with other dogs and pets, provided he is properly socialized and trained.

Do you think life with a large, boisterous, shaggy dog would be perfect? If so, the Otterhound might be the dog for you. The Otterhound is an old breed, developed in England from Bloodhounds and other types of dogs. Although the Otterhound is believed to have been in existence for more than 500 years, it"s a fairly rare breed today. There are currently fewer than 1,000 Otterhounds, only 350 to 500 of them residing in the United States. In fact, just four to seven litters are born each year in the United States and Canada. If you have your heart set on an Otterhound, expect difficulty finding one. Why is the breed so uncommon? No one knows for sure, but it certainly isn"t because of the Otterhound personality. Sometimes called the "class clown," the Otterhound has a sweet, affectionate, fun-loving personality. He"s independent, too, not demanding a lot of attention. After greeting you with enthusiasm, the Otterhound is likely to finish the nap he was taking when you arrived. The Otterhound is a large breed. Even small females weigh about 65 pounds, and large males can weigh 125 pounds. They"re definitely dogs who take up space in the household. Otterhounds are great with kids, but because of their large size and bouncy personality, they may be too rowdy for very young or small children. They can also be too boisterous for frail seniors. The Otterhound has a distinctively shaggy look. His head appears to be very large and long; and his ears are long and folded, giving them a draped appearance. He"s physically strong, with a long, striding gait. He has the extremely sensitive nose of a hound, and it"s likely to lead him off to investigate his surroundings. Because the Otterhound was bred to hunt on land and in water, he has a rough, double coat and large, webbed feet. He comes in many different colors, the most common being a variation of black and tan grizzle, which often gets lighter as the dog gets older. The Otterhound has the distinctive and almost musical bark of the hound. This deep, loud, extended bay is music to a hunter"s ears, but it might not play as well with the neighbors. Although some Otterhounds are quiet, most seem to like the sound of their own voices, so it"s wise to teach your Otterhound a "quiet" command. Speaking of voices, the Otterhound also has wide range of vocalizations, from grunts to groans. Some even like to "sing" and vocalize with other dogs or with people. Otterhounds are usually good with other dogs and animals if they are raised with them or introduced carefully. The Otterhound benefits from a lot of socialization, especially as a pup, and it"s good for him to be included in all aspects of your life. Otterhounds tend to be opinionated, so training requires patience, especially since they become especially playful when they don"t want to comply with whatever you"re asking them to do. And because of their large size, training is absolutely necessary. Despite size and strength, however, the Otterhound has a "soft" personality; he doesn"t respond to harsh training methods. It"s best to be even more stubborn than he is, while keeping the training sessions short, fun, and positive for both of you. The Otterhound enjoys food, so this can be a great motivator in training. Be aware that his love of food can lead him astray: there are stories of Otterhounds who have learned to escape from any confinement to get into the kitchen, where they open cabinets, drawers, and even the refrigerator in order to steal a tasty tidbit. The Otterhound needs exercise, and a lot of it. He has a great deal of stamina and energy; jogging for three or four miles is like a walk in the park to him. If left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, especially without enough exercise, the Otterhound will find ways to entertain himself--ways that are apt to displease you, such as nonstop baying or excavating your newly planted flower garden. The hardworking Otterhound can be trained to compete in obedience and agility. He excels in tracking, and the percentage of Otterhounds who earn American Kennel Club tracking titles is usually higher each year than for any other breed. Despite his size, strength, and impressive bark, the Otterhound isn"t really suited to guard duty — he"s far too friendly to take the job of a watchdog seriously.
Otterhounds require a great deal of exercise, and not just chasing a ball in the backyard. A vigorous daily workout of jogging or swimming for several miles is needed to keep him physically and mentally healthy. However, because of the adverse effect of strenuous exercise on growing joints and bones, you should limit exercise among puppies and adolescent Otterhounds (and among those with hip dysplasia). Swimming is the best exercise for younger dogs, because the risk of joint injury is minimal. Otterhounds are enthusiastic and loud barkers. But don"t expect yours to be a guard dog — he"s far too friendly for that. Don"t allow your Otterhound off-leash in unfenced areas; you never know when he might catch an enticing scent and run off. Otterhounds enjoy being outdoors, but they"re best suited to living daily life inside the house with their families. A fenced yard is mandatory. Otterhounds have been known to jump fences as high as five feet, so be sure the fencing is at least six feet tall. The Otterhound is affectionate, but he"s also independent. He won"t follow you around, begging for attention. He"ll probably greet you when you get home, and then — if he doesn"t need exercise — he"ll return to his favorite snoozing spot. The Otterhound loves food and can become obese if you don"t monitor his diet. Also, his incredible sense of smell enables him to locate those special goodies you"ve hidden in the cabinets, and his size and cleverness enable him to find a way to get at them. Big dog, bigger expense. Everything for a big dog costs more, from food to grooming to veterinary care. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
While it"s fairly certain that Otterhounds descended from Bloodhounds, some think that they might also be related to French Griffons because of the distinctive fold of their ears. The breed was developed in England to hunt and destroy otters, which were decimating the fish in English rivers. Otter hunting, largely enjoyed by the nobility, was the first organized sport in England that used packs of scent hounds. It was first mentioned in the 12th century, during the reign of Henry II. The Otterhound, however, was not mentioned as a specific breed for another 200 years. The Otterhound was used, along with small terriers, to hunt otters along the banks of ponds and rivers. Terriers flushed the otter from its den; when the otter ran to the water, the Otterhound took over. The Otterhound"s nose is so sensitive that he can follow not only the "wash" (the scent of the otter in the water), but also the "drag," the trail of the otter on land. The dogs have been known to stay on 12-hour-old trails and to swim and wade as far as 20 miles in a day. With his rough, weather-resistant outer coat; slightly oily undercoat; big, webbed feet; and size, strength, and determination, the Otterhound did his job so well that eventually otters were declared a protected species in England. Otter hunting became illegal in 1982 (although some people then used their Otterhounds to hunt mink). Along the way, however, the Otterhound picked up many notable admirers. In fact, it"s said that the Otterhound was fancied by more kings (and one queen) than any other breed. Included among the Otterhounds" royal fanciers were Edward II, Henry VI, Richard III, Henry VIII, King John, Charles II, Edward IV, Henry II, Henry VII, and Elizabeth I. Otter hunting reached its peak popularity in the years immediately before World War I. At that time there were more than 500 hounds, in 24 packs, that hunted otter in England. Most of these dogs weren"t purebred Otterhounds, however, because hunters continued to crossbreed to improve the prowess of their dogs. Otterhounds appear to have been brought to the United States in 1900. They were first entered in a conformation show in 1907 in Claremont, Oklahoma. The Otterhound Club of America was founded in 1960, and the first National Specialty took place in 1981. The Otterhound was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1991.
Males are approximately 27 inches tall and weigh about 115 pounds. Females are approximately 24 inches tall and weigh about 80 pounds.
The Otterhound is an amiable fellow, with plenty of affection for every member of the family. He loves children, though he can play a little rough (not purposely) due to his large size. He is devoted to his family, but not overly so. He"s likely to extend happy greetings when you come home at the end of the day, but don"t expect him to follow you from room to room. He"s too independent for that. The Otterhound"s characteristic independence makes training challenging. You have to convince him that he wants to do what you"re asking. This is entirely possible, as long as you are patient and skilled. The good-natured Otterhound is not a top candidate for a watchdog. He"ll sound a loud warning bark to intruders, but that"s about it. As with every dog, the Otterhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Otterhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Otterhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Otterhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Otterhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Otterhounds. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs. Hip Dysplasia: In this inherited condition, the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Canine Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia (CIT): Also called immune mediated thrombocytopenia or ITP, this condition results from an immune system disorder in which there are not enough platelets. CIT is more common in female dogs than in males, and it runs primarily in a few Otterhound lines. Symptoms include abnormal bleeding under the skin or gums.
Because of his large size and high activity needs, the Otterhound is not recommended for apartment dwellers or families without yards. He"s perfect, however, for active families who can take him jogging or, better yet, swimming each day. If he has enough exercise, he"s relatively inactive when inside the house. In temperate and cool climates, the Otterhound can sleep outdoors if he has adequate shelter. However, since he loves to be near his family, in spite of his independent nature, he can become bored and start barking, digging, or trying to escape if left alone too much. Invisible electric fences are not adequate for containing the Otterhound. Training and socialization are essential for the Otterhound, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Otterhound pup with you wherever he"s allowed, be it the lumber yard, the pet supply store, outdoor events, or on long walks in busy parks. Anyplace where there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Otterhound. Just don"t let your Otterhound off his leash in such places, even if you think he"ll come reliably when called. His instinct is to follow his nose, and that, coupled with his independent nature, means he"s likely to give take off after any interesting scent.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Do not overfeed the Otterhound, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Limit treats and encourage activity. Keep food safely locked away, too, to prevent thievery! Keep your Otterhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Otterhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
You might say the messy look is "in" with the Otterhound. This characteristically scruffy-looking breed has a double coat. The outer coat is two to six inches long, rough and very thick. The undercoat is woolly and slightly oily. With this combination, the Otterhound is relatively weather-resistant, and he can bound in and out of streams and lakes without the undercoat absorbing a great deal of water. The Otterhound"s coat color is any recognized hound color except liver and white, all white, or white with distinct black and tan patches. Black and tan grizzle is common. The shaggy Otterhound coat sheds and must be brushed at least once a week to avoid matting. Some Otterhounds have softer coats that require brushing at least two to three times a week to prevent mats. The Otterhound coat is best kept au naturel, so it is not clipped. If you decide to clip because the coat is matted, or because your dog has a skin condition, it takes about two years for the coat to grow back to its original length. You may need to wash his beard daily, because it tends to drag in his food or on the ground; and if you don"t keep the beard clean, it can develop an unpleasant odor. Brush your Otterhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Since they are long and hang down, they don"t allow the best air circulation, and ear infections can result. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Otterhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Otterhounds are boisterous, fun-loving dogs, but because of their size and tendency toward clumsiness, you should supervise them when they are with small children. They love children and wouldn"t hurt them intentionally, but their size and exuberance might cause them to knock a small child to the ground. The Otterhound is probably better suited to a family with older children, ages 10 and up. If properly trained and socialized, the Otterhound gets along well with other dogs. Use caution when introducing him to small pets, however. The Otterhound"s hunting instinct is strong, and he"s likely to chase animals he perceives as prey.

The Papillon, whose name comes from the French word for butterfly, is a portrait come to life, the modern representation of the small spaniels often seen in paintings from centuries past. The dwarf spaniel, as he was once known, has changed somewhat in appearance over the years, but he"s still the same wonderful companion who graced the laps of ladies and kings so many years ago. The word papillon, meaning "butterfly," refers to the breed"s fringed upright ears, which resemble a butterfly"s outspread wings. The breed also comes in a drop-eared variety called the phalene, which means "moth," a cousin of the butterfly that folds its wings at rest. Both varieties can be born in the same litter, although the Papillon is the more popular and recognized variety. While he might be categorized by size as a lap dog, the bright, busy, and curious Papillon is no shrinking butterfly. If you want a dog to sit on your lap while you watch television, he"s probably not the best choice. He"s more likely to be flitting around looking for something to do and will happily rid your home and yard of any small rodents that might be lurking there. And this small dog in a sturdy package takes seriously his duties as family companion and guardian. He has a big-dog attitude and a level of alertness that makes him a super watchdog, but when it comes to protecting you it"s important to make sure he doesn"t bite off more than he can chew. He has no idea that he weighs only 4 to 9 pounds. The Papillon is outgoing and energetic. He loves to be with people and is a happy dog who gives kisses freely to all. The Papillon"s small size makes him easy to handle, and his coat, while profuse, is easy to care for and doesn"t shed excessively. His energy level ranges from moderate to intense, and being highly trainable he"s a great choice if you want to participate in dog sports such as agility or rally. Papillons are also excellent competitors in the obedience ring and are the number-one toy breed in obedience competition. All Papillon owners should attend obedience class if only to ensure that they don"t spoil their charming companions. Papillons can develop a stubborn streak if not shown early that such behavior will not be tolerated. On the plus side, their will to please and desire to succeed make them good at learning tricks or anything else a creative person can teach them. Papillons can even learn to pull a tiny cart and will proudly pull it in parades. Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It"s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge. Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child"s hands and injure himself if he"s not being held correctly, and he won"t hesitate to defend himself if he"s being mistreated. No matter what the breed, dogs and children must always be supervised when they"re together. This is a long-lived breed. It"s common for Papillons to live well into their teens, and if you"re considering purchasing one you should take that into consideration. The dog will be a member of your family for years to come. A Papillon made breed history in 1999 when for the first time one took Best In Show at the Westminster Kennel Club show. The dog, Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being, or Kirby to his friends, also won the World Dog Show in Helsinki, Finland, and the Royal Invitational in Canada in 1998. This dog"s wins introduced the breed to many who had never seen or heard of the Papillon and has contributed to the breed"s rise in popularity. Nonetheless, you won"t find a Papillon on every street corner. He"s not a rare breed, but he"s not common, either. Most breeders have a waiting list because Papillons tend to have small litters. The Papillon has been bred for centuries to be the ultimate companion. They are extremely people oriented and demand to be included in their person"s life at all times. If you are looking for a lively, energetic, outgoing, and gregarious companion this could be the breed for you. You and your Papillon will live happily together for many years.
Some lines can be nervous, high-strung, and timid. This is not appropriate for the breed. Avoid puppies with these characteristics or puppies from parents with these characteristics. Papillons do not do well in environments where there is little time for the dog. They will choose to be never separated from their human companions. Puppies are fragile and can be injured by rough and tumble play. They are not suitable for families with very small children. Papillons are among the breeds sensitive to anesthesia. Keep this in mind when scheduling any surgical procedure. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Papillon was portrayed in portraits dating to the 16th century, a testament to the breed"s age and staying power. Rubens, Watteau, Boucher, Van Dyke, Rembrandt, and Fragonard all portrayed them in various artworks, usually accompanying their doting mistresses. The little spaniels were favorite companions of court ladies throughout Europe. Traders carried them in baskets on mules through France, Italy, and Spain. The early toy spaniels from which the Papillon descended had drop ears, but in the 17th century court of Louis XIV a small spaniel with upright ears was developed and given the name Papillon for its resemblance to a butterfly. Other names by which the breed has been known over the centuries include Epagneul Nain (dwarf spaniel), Dwarf Continental Spaniels, Little Squirrel Dogs (because their full, plumed tail resembled that of a squirrel) or Belgian Toy Spaniels. Besides the ears, the only other major change in the breed"s appearance was in color. Originally the little spaniels were solid-colored, but these days they"re white with patches of color. Otherwise, a Papillon today looks much the same as one you might see portrayed in a painting in the Louvre. The drop-eared variety, known as the Phalene, still exists although he"s not as commonly seen. The Papillon ranks 35th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
Papillons stand 8 to 11 inches at the shoulder and weigh 4 to 9 pounds.
The Papillon is happy, alert, and friendly. He should never be shy or aggressive. This is, however, a take-charge little dog with a moderate to intense activity level. He"s very smart and highly trainable and is best described as a doer, not a cuddler. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Papillons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Papillon pup grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Papillons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Papillons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Papillons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a possible problem with all toy breed puppies. Hypoglycemia is easily treatable in the early stages but can be fatal if not treated. It is important that breeders and owners of toy breed puppies recognize the signs and symptoms because this condition can often be misdiagnosed as viral hepatitis or encephalitis by veterinarians. A puppy with hypoglycemia will slow down and become listless, followed by trembling or shivering. Place some honey under his tongue and get him to the vet immediately. If the situation is allowed to continue, he"ll eventually collapse, go into convulsions, fall into a coma, and die. Any time your Papillon is limp, with grayish-blue gums and tongue, it"s an emergency. Hypoglycemia occurs in toy puppies because they do not have the fat reserves to supply adequate glucose in times of stress or when they do not eat regularly. Collapsed Trachea: It is not completely understood how this occurs, but the rapid inhalation of air causes the trachea to flatten and makes it difficult for air to enter the lungs, much like a soda straw being drawn on too vigorously. This condition may be inherited; it occurs in certain breeds, and dogs with it show an abnormality in the chemical makeup of their tracheal rings in which the rings lose their stiffness and become unable to retain their circular shape. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Open Fontanel: Papillons are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby"s will, but sometimes one will not close fully. An accidental blow to that spot on the head could kill a Papillon with an unclosed soft spot.
Papillons are housedogs and aren"t suited to living outdoors. They are active, however, and will enjoy having a yard where they can run in wild, fast circles. If that"s not available, however, they"ll make do with tearing through your house and jumping on and off the furniture. They are often described as mountain goats, so don"t be surprised if you find yours up on the kitchen table or some other high spot. Adults need two or three 20- to 30-minute walks or playtimes per day, and they"ll appreciate more if you can provide it. Start puppies with two or three 10- to 15-minute walks and gradually increase the time and distance. Puppy or adult, they"ll let you know if they"re getting tired by stopping or sitting. Although they grow up to be sturdy little dogs, Papillon puppies can be fragile. They can easily break a leg soaring off the back of the sofa or jumping off the bed, so try to avoid such situations by teaching them to use steps to get on and off furniture or waiting until you lift them down. Papillons are easy to housetrain if you keep them on a schedule. Always take them out when they first wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, after a grooming session or bath, and just before bedtime. When you can"t supervise them, they should be crated or placed in a puppy-proofed room. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Papillon doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Papillon accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Papillon in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Papillons are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Train your Papillon using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. It"s easy to overfeed a Papillon, but he has delicate knees and shouldn"t be allowed to get fat. Keep your Papillon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Papillon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Papillon"s long, flowing coat is straight, fine, and silky, with no undercoat. Cascading down his chest is a frill of hair. His beautiful butterfly-like ears are fringed with hair, and the insides are covered with medium-length silken hair. Feathering covers the backs of the forelegs, and the hind legs are dressed in breeches, a fringe of longish hair on the thigh area, also known as culottes. Topping it all off is a long, flowing plume of a tail carried proudly arched over the body. The Papillon is always parti-colored, white with patches of any color. On the head, any color other than white covers both ears back and front and extends without interruption from the ears over both eyes. The ideal Papillon has a clearly defined white blaze and nose band, but one with a solidly marked head still makes a great companion. The nose, eye rims, and lips are black. The coat isn"t prone to matting but should be combed and brushed once or twice a week to distribute the natural skin oils and keep the hair and skin healthy. The Papillon doesn"t have a doggie odor, so bathe him only as needed. He"s a wash-and-go kind of dog. Trim nails two or three times a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Small dogs are prone to periodontal disease, so start dental hygiene early. Brushing your Papillon"s teeth two or three times a week — daily if possible — will help keep them clean and tartar-free.
Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child"s hands and injure himself if he"s not being held correctly, and he won"t hesitate to defend himself if he"s being mistreated. Many breeders won"t sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured. Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Papillon if they"re sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It"s not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.

For a "designer dog," the Peekapoo dog breed has a fairly long history; with the help of responsible breeders, it"s possible that the history will get longer still. A cross between a Pekingese and a Poodle, he was among the first of the recent slew of Poodle crosses to be developed, back in the 1950s and "60s. He hasn"t gained as much recognition as some of the other designer dogs, such as the Labradoodle and the Cockapoo, but he"s won enough of a following that he"s thrived for the last five decades. One possible reason for his success is that some designer dog breeders are trying to create a formal breed, whereas the Peekapoo folks believe that the best Peekapoo is still a cross between a purebred Pekingese and a purebred Poodle, and they don"t breed Peekapoos to Peekapoos. The Peekapoo doesn"t have a club or any organization trying to nudge him into recognition as a breed. This keeps him fairly clear of inherent diseases, although some still occur because a dog"s health depends on how well the breeder has selected the parents. Like most designer dogs, the Peekapoo was developed to be a companion for people with allergies. As with all designer dogs, some can still have coats that produce an average amount of shed hair and dander, setting off a person"s allergies. But even though designer "Doodle" dogs aren"t a perfect fit for those with allergies, the intelligent and affectionate Peekapoo steals many hearts and has made his way into a lot of homes and laps. He"s also begun to see success as a therapy dog. He makes an excellent watchdog and will bark without fail whenever he sees something or someone he thinks is suspicious. If you live somewhere with noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you. He may be small, but he has a mighty loud bark. The Peekapoo is an outdoorsman. He fares best in a home with a fenced yard, although he can do well in an apartment. The Peekapoo should definitely live in a home with air-conditioning, because he can succumb quickly to heat exhaustion thanks to that flat-faced pedigree. He shouldn"t live outdoors or be left unsupervised outside. Proper exercise is a must; expect at least one walk and a good play session in the yard each day. He has a high energy level and if he doesn"t get his daily activity he can become destructive. A Peekapoo doesn"t extend his affections to strangers; he"s naturally suspicious of them, and they must earn his trust. A Peekapoo needs to be socialized to a variety of people and stimuli to be the well-rounded and affectionate dog that he can easily be. The Peekapoo generally gets along with everyone in his family. He does well with older, more considerate children, and he must be socialized and raised with children to be accepting of them. He behaves well with other dogs and pets, but again, he needs to be raised with them and properly socialized. Being a companion dog, the Peekapoo isn"t happy when left alone for long periods at a time. He can suffer from separation anxiety and become destructive when on his own.
The Peekapoo is a designer breed and is usually the result of Pekingese to Toy or Miniature Poodle breeding. Multigenerational breedings (Peekapoo to Peekapoo) are rare. If you"re interested in a Peekapoo puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren"t as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don"t know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog. The Peekapoo is an active and energetic dog. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard. Don"t overexercise a Peekapoo to the point of respiratory distress. Peekapoos can suffer from heat exhaustion quickly. They do best in a home that has air-conditioning. Barking is a favorite pastime for a Peekapoo. They make excellent watchdogs and will alert bark at people or things they think are suspicious. A clipped Peekapoo only requires about two brushings per week, while a Peekapoo with a full, natural coat will require daily brushing. Loving and gentle, the Peekapoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children. Peekapoos generally do well with other dogs and pets if they"re introduced to them at a young age. Peekapoos can be easy to train with positive reinforcement. With his small stature, the Peekapoo can make an excellent apartment dweller, but he"s happiest with a yard in which to enjoy the great outdoors. Peekapoos may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Peekapoo is one of the oldest of the hybrid, or designer, breeds. He was developed in the 1950s with the cross of a Pekingese with a Miniature or Toy Poodle. The goal was to produce a non- to low-shedding dog suitable for people with allergies. The Peekapoo gained popularity by the early 1960s, around the same time as the Cockapoo. Despite the popularity of the Peekapoo, there is no breed club. The hybrid has remained largely a first-generation cross; the parents are usually Pekingese and Poodles. There is no indication that multigenerational breeding will occur — but never say never. Due to his small, lap-friendly size and sweetly affectionate temperament, the Peekapoo has maintained a strong following.
There is no breed standard, so there"s nothing for breeders to conform to. Therefore, the Peekapoo is seen in a range of sizes. He averages up to 11 inches in height, and he can range in weight from 4 to 20 pounds.
The Peekapoo is a loving and loyal dog who is dedicated to his family. An ideal lapdog, he delights in being part of every family activity. He is gentle and rarely combative. He is an intelligent dog who is happiest with his owner, especially out in the great outdoors. Protective of his family, he"ll defend them with everything in that small body. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Because he"s naturally suspicious of strangers and new dogs, early and ongoing socialization is a must for the Peekapoo. If not properly socialized, he can be slightly aggressive or timid. That"s true of any dog, but particularly so for those who tend toward being wary of strangers. Enrolling your young Peekapoo in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start down the road of socialization. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking him to busy parks and stores that allow dogs, and going on leisurely strolls to meet the neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you"re looking for a Peekapoo. Hybrid vigor isn"t necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it"s the opposite of inbreeding. However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won"t have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from a different line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they"re purebred. Peekapoos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Peekapoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Before you bring home your Peekapoo, find out if he"s from a first-generation or multigenerational breeding (although multigenerational breedings are rare in Peekapoos). If he"s a first-generation dog, research the health concerns that occur in both Pekinese and Toy or Miniature Poodles. Regardless of generation, all parents should have the applicable health clearances. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Peekapoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This affliction involves the hip joint, usually in small dogs. If your Peekapoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is another common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.
The Peekapoo is an active little dog who requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy. Unwanted energy can lead to destructive behavior, and it"s shocking — truly shocking — how much damage a small, bored dog can do. A Peekapoo enjoys being outside and likes to play in the yard and go for walks (all walks are considered nice walks). However, don"t overexercise a Peekapoo; brachycephalic dogs with flat faces, such as Pekingese, Pugs, and some Peekapoos, can easily overheat and develop respiratory troubles as a result. And remember that a high-energy small dog won"t require as much exercise as a high-energy large dog. The Peekapoo can be trained easily with the use of positive reinforcement. Harsh corrections should not be used with a Peekapoo, since they can literally hurt him. A Peekapoo can adapt to any type of dwelling, including apartments, but they do much better with a small fenced yard to access, since they enjoy being outdoors. They should not be left unattended outside, however, since they can become prey for larger dogs and animals in the neighborhood. A Peekapoo should also live in a home with air-conditioning, since they can be susceptible to heat exhaustion. A Peekapoo should never be exercised or left outside on unusually hot days. Peekapoos are noisy and will alert bark whenever they see something or someone suspicious. That"s not always a barrel of laughs, but at least they make great watchdogs. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Peekapoo doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Peekapoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Peekapoo in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Peekapoos aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Peekapoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Peekapoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Peekapoo"s coat is usually soft in texture and has an almost cottony feel. It should be wavy and of medium to long length. There is no undercoat. The desired coat is low-shedding, but a Peekapoo can range from low to average shedding, depending on the roll of the genetic dice. Coat colors run a tremendous range, from silver, gray, white, sable, red, cream, apricot, chocolate, to buff and black. The Peekapoo can also have a variety of markings, including phantom, which is black with tan markings. A Peekapoo"s fine coat requires regular grooming to stay healthy and free of tangles. He requires some care in keeping the Pekingese-based wrinkles and folds around the eyes, muzzle, ears, and nose free of dirt and debris. The Peekapoo can be clipped for easier care, but he still requires regular brushing and bathing. If his coat is kept long, then it will need to be brushed daily to avoid tangles and mats. Occasionally hair can cause some irritation to the eyes. If this happens, pluck the offending hair regularly. Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Brush your Peekapoo"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your short Peekapoo enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Peekapoo to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the nose, mouth, and eyes. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
A Peekapoo can make a loving companion to any child if properly introduced to children from a young age. The Peekapoo is naturally suspicious of new people, and a loud, rambunctious kid may be too much for an older Peekapoo to handle. And even though a socialized Peekapoo is gentle with youngsters, he"s not suited to homes with small children who may unintentionally hurt him — a Peekapoo can be injured easily. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Peekapoo also does well with other dogs and pets, but again, early socialization is the key to success. Otherwise the Peekapoo can be combative and aggressive toward new dogs and pets.

It"s no wonder the Pekingese has a self-important attitude, given his history as an imperial favorite. He was held in great esteem at the imperial court of China, and he still knows it today. A Pekingese will greet you with dignity and pride. He is well aware that his ancestors were the companions of royalty and he continues to demand the respect such a position entails today. With his soft round brown eyes, mane of long straight hair and tail carried jauntily over his back, he swaggers through life in full awareness of who he is and the importance he has to the people who live with him. Pekingese are very intelligent, but that intelligence is offset by an independent mind and a wide stubborn streak. Training them is a challenge. They consider themselves in charge of any situation so you must persuade them that you are in charge and that doing what you want is to their advantage. Pekingese do not respond well to harsh training or discipline and it can cause them to become defensive and possibly to bite. Pekingese are very loving and affectionate with their family but aloof, almost wary, of strangers. That characteristic makes them excellent watchdogs; they like to bark when strangers approach. Some Pekingese tend to bark too much, so it"s a good idea early on to teach them when to stop. They are brave, sometimes to the point of being foolhardy, and will defend you to the death if needed. While children are always intrigued by small dogs, a Pekingese is not a good choice for families with toddlers who may treat him roughly without meaning to. The Peke won"t tolerate being grabbed or poked and won"t hesitate to defend himself. Always supervise any interaction between a Pekingese and a child of any age. Pekes don"t always get along with other dogs. They prefer the company of other Pekingese, and it can take them a long time to get used to other animals in the household. With proper socialization — early exposure to many different people, other animals, sights, sounds, and experiences — however, they can become best friends with other dogs and cats and include them in their royal group. Until you"re sure everyone gets along, though, supervise any active play. The Peke"s round, protuberant eyes are easily injured with the swipe of a paw or claw. The profuse coat of the Pekingese needs daily to weekly care. The long, flowing coat of the show dog needs daily maintenance, but people who have companion Pekingese can choose to keep their pets" coats trimmed short to ease the burden of grooming. If you are looking for a devoted, loving friend who will treat you with respect and dignity and expect the same treatment from you, then the Pekingese may be a breed to consider. They need someone who understands their unique needs and who is willing to make room for a truly individual personality in their lives. The Pekingese will return your care with all the love and affection that a truly large heart in a small package can offer.
Due to their short noses, Pekes snore, some quite loudly. The round bulging eye of the Pekingese can be damaged or "popped out" during excessively rough play; this is rare but can occur. Pekes have an excessive amount of wrinkling on face; this can cause problems with skin fold dermatitis, skin irritations, and infections. The folds should be kept clean and dry. Pekes have a tendency to gain weight if overfed. A Peke may go on a hunger strike just to prove a point over his owner. Pekingese tend to bark a lot. The breed can be difficult to housebreak. Pekingese tend to be one-person dogs. Because of their profuse coat and short noses, they do not tolerate heat well. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
According to Chinese legend, a lion once fell in love with a marmoset, a type of monkey. To wed his love, the lion begged Buddha to reduce him in size but let him retain his great lion heart and character. Buddha consented, and from the union of the two descended the dogs of Fu Lin, the lion dogs of China. Perhaps that"s not quite how the Pekingese came into being, but it"s a good story. The breed is indeed ancient, with DNA evidence confirming it as one of the oldest of dog breeds. The Peke is believed to have existed in China for as long as 2,000 years. Named for the capital city of Peking (now Beijing), they were companions to nobles, princes, and members of the imperial family. Commoners bowed down to them, treatment they still expect today. The Pekingese was closely guarded and never allowed to leave the palace let alone the country, but he came to the attention of the Western world as a result of the Opium War in 1860. When British troops entered the imperial palace after invading Peking, one of their discoveries was five Pekingese dogs guarding the body of their mistress, who had committed suicide rather than face capture. The dogs became prizes of war and were taken to England where two were presented to the Duchess of Wellington, two to the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon, and one to Queen Victoria, who named it "Looty." They remained rare, although by the 1890s, more Pekingese were being smuggled out of China. A dog named Pekin Peter was reportedly the first Pekingese to be exhibited at a British dog show, in 1894. The breed at the time was known variously as a Chinese Pug and a Pekingese Spaniel. A Pekingese club was established in 1904. Naturally, the Peke"s popularity spread across the Atlantic to the United States. The first Pekingese registered by the American Kennel Club was Rascal, in 1906, and the Pekingese Club of America was formed in 1909. Today the breed ranks 49th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
The Pekingese is heavy for his size with a stocky, muscular body. He is 6 to 9 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 7 to 14 pounds. In imperial China, Pekingese that weighed less than six pounds were called "sleeve dogs" and rode in the sleeve cuffs of the robes worn by members of the imperial court.
He may look foofy, but the Pekingese is a stand-up character who"s tougher and braver than his appearance suggests. The Peke"s regal dignity, self-importance, confidence, and stubborn streak all come together in a lively, affectionate, good-natured dog who"ll respect you if you respect him. He"s loyal to and protective of his people, barking in warning when strangers appear. Train him with firm, kind consistency, using positive reinforcements such as food rewards and praise. You will always succeed if you can persuade the Peke that doing something is his idea, not yours. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Pekingese need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Peke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pekingese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pekes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pekes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Brachycephalic Syndrome: The full name for the condition is brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS). This condition occurs in those breeds that have been selectively bred to have a shortened face. These dogs have some problem with breathing from the time they are born. The exaggerated features that occur with their anatomy include an elongated and fleshy soft palate, narrowed nostrils, changes to the larynx, and a relatively small trachea. Problems vary according to the severity of the disease. Most brachycephalic dogs snuffle and snort to some degree. Some have no other problems; others have increasingly noisy breathing, coughing, gagging, fainting, and collapsing episodes and a decreased tolerance for exercise. Overheating is especially dangerous for these breeds because panting causes more swelling and narrowing of the airway, increasing the dogs" anxiety. Treatment can include keeping dog from becoming overweight, corticosteroids for short term relief of airway inflammation, and surgical shortening of the soft palate if it is elongated. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian. Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner. Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog"s eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia. Ectopic Cilia: An abnormality of eyelash growth in which extra eyelashes grow through the eyelid to the inside. One or more ectopic cilia may be present. Clinical signs of discomfort vary according to the number of abnormal cilia and whether they are fine or coarse. This type of eyelash abnormality is particularly irritating to the eye and more likely to cause corneal ulcers. Treatment consists of treating any corneal ulcers that have occurred with antibiotics and surgical removal of the aberrant follicle. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Pekingese has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if he doesn"t outgrow it by adulthood. Fold Dermatitis: A skin infection caused by folds in the skin in which rubbing occurs or moisture gets trapped. It is more commonly found in breeds that have folds in the skin such as Pekingese. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor, and the dog can be affected on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, and any other fold on the body. The treatment for fold dermatitis varies depending on the area affected, but it can include surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. It can also include topical antibiotic ointments. The best means of treatment is to properly maintain your dog"s coat to prevent the condition. Hydrocephalus: Occurs when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain accumulates because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of perinatal trauma, placing pressure on the brain. This usually occurs in young dogs under the age of 18 months and older dogs that are more than 6 years old. If hydrocephalus is left untreated, the dog will die. Treatment consists of medical treatment and surgery where either the obstruction is removed or a shunt is inserted. Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye, is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform a Schirmer tear test to diagnose dry eye, which can be controlled with medication and special care. This eye condition requires life-long therapy and care. Mitral Valve Disease: This defect in the mitral valve of the heart causes a backup of blood into the left atrium, known as mitral regurgitation. This causes the heart to be less efficient at pumping the blood. It is the most common acquired cardiac disease, affecting more than one-third of dogs over ten years of age. There are several breeds that are genetically predisposed to acquire the condition at a much younger age, and the Pekingese is one of them. If your veterinarian hears a heart murmur, your Peke should be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome: This syndrome can be caused by a number of factors such as exophthalmos, which is a protrusion of the eyeball, macroblepharon, which is a large eyelid opening, and lagophthalmos, which is an inability to completely close the eyelid. These factors cause the cornea to be exposed, resulting in an inability to blink properly and the easy evaporation of tears. The syndrome can lead to corneal ulcers, and a pigmentation of the cornea that may cause vision impairment. Signs are generally red eyes, increased tears, and pawing at the eyes. Treatment for Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome is usually various surgeries, but tear substitutes have been used as a temporary treatment. Intervertebral Disk Disease: The spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column, and between the bones of the vertebral column are intervertebral discs that work as shock absorbers and allow normal movement of the vertebrae. The discs are made of two layers, an outer fibrous layer and an inner jelly-like layer. Intervertebral disc disease occurs when the jelly like inner layer protrudes into the spinal canal and pushes against the spinal cord. Compression of the spinal cord may be minimal, causing neck or back pain, or it can be severe, causing loss of sensation, paralysis, and lack of bowel or bladder control. The damage done by the spinal compression may be irreversible. Treatment is based on several factors, including location, severity, and length of time between injury and treatment. Confining the dog may be of some use, but surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is not always successful.
Pekingese make good apartment dogs, and of course they"ll be equally happy in a mansion. They love to run and romp but need a fenced area because they will explore and may wander off. Pekingese appreciate going for walks and will be excellent company jaunting through the neighborhood with you. They will run around the house, especially with another Peke or other dog. Despite their heavy coat, Pekingese are housedogs and should not live outdoors. Their short noses make them sensitive to heat, so they need to live in an air-conditioned environment. Pekes are stubborn and can be difficult to train. They won"t respond at all to harsh corrections or training methods. Reward them any time they do something you like, and be creative in persuading them that what you want them to do is their idea and worth their while.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Pekes are meant to be stocky, muscular dogs who feel heavy when lifted, but they shouldn"t be fat. Keep your Pekingese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs fewer bonbons and more exercise. For more on feeding your Peke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pekingese wears a coat that is long, coarse, and straight, standing away from the body like a furry halo. Beneath the topcoat is a thick, soft undercoat. True to his description as a lion dog, the Pekingese has a noticeable mane on the neck and shoulder area, with the coat on the rest of the body being somewhat shorter. While it should be long and profuse, the coat should not obscure the shape of the body. Long feathering is found on the backs of the legs and on the toes, with longer fringing on the ears and tail. The Peke"s coat can be any color or have any markings, including black and tan, fawn or red brindle, and particolor, which is white with another color. He may or may not have a black mask. Solid white Pekingese were highly prized by the Chinese and are still popular today. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips, and eye rims is black. Unless you"re showing him, you can brush your Peke"s coat weekly with a small bristle brush, curry brush, or shedding comb. Before brushing, mist the coat lightly with water to prevent the hair from breaking. Brush all the way down to the skin; if you just go over the top of the coat, you won"t get out the dead hair that forms mats and tangles. Continue to mist the hair as you brush each area of the body. Use a metal comb on the feathering and fringing on the legs, ears, and tail. These areas tangle easily, so comb them daily. Clean the face and around the eyes daily with a damp cotton ball to prevent problems with the skin folds in the area. Keep skin folds clean and dry to prevent infections. Any time your Peke gets wet, thoroughly dry the skin folds until no dampness remains. Bathe your Pekingese once or twice a month, as needed. Use a shampoo made for dogs so you don"t dry out his coat. You can also shake on a dry dog shampoo and then brush it out. Trim the hair on the feet to prevent mats from developing and foreign objects from becoming tangled there. Trim the nails regularly, usually every two or three weeks. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Teaching your Peke puppy to accept having his teeth brushed at least weekly (daily is better) can help prevent dental disease later in life, a common problem in small dogs.
A Pekingese is not a good choice for families with toddlers who may treat him roughly without meaning to. The Peke won"t tolerate being grabbed or poked and won"t hesitate to defend himself. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Pekes prefer the company of other Pekingese, but with early socialization they can learn to get along with other dogs (and cats) and may even rule over dogs that are 20 times their size.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  10 inches to 1 foot tall at the shoulderWeight:  Up to 30 poundsLife Span:  12 to 14 years
Welsh Corgis come in two varieties: the Pembroke and the Cardigan. They were registered as one breed by the Kennel Club in the U.K. until 1934, although many breeders believe the two breeds developed separately. Both have similar heads, bodies, levels of intelligence and herding ability, but the Cardigan is slightly larger and heavier boned than the Pembroke.For most of us, the easiest way to tell the difference between a Pembroke and a Cardigan is to look at the tails. Pembrokes" are docked and Cardigans" are long. (Remember it this way: the Pembroke has a "broke" tail; the Cardigan has a long tail like the sleeves of a cardigan sweater.)Pembroke Welsh Corgis (also called Pembrokes, PWCs or Pems) are the smallest of the American Kennel Club"s Herding Group, and are also recognized by the United Kennel Club. Their coats can be red, sable, fawn or tri-colored (red, black and tan), usually with white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle and belly. They also may have a narrow blaze on their heads. Pembroke heads are shaped much like the head of a fox. Their eyes are oval-shaped and dark, and their ears are erect.The official AKC breed standard is maintained by the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club of America.
Pembrokes are vocal dogs that have a tendency to bark at anything and everything. While they are intelligent dogs, they also can be stubborn. If housebreaking is a problem, crate training is advised. Their strong herding instinct may cause them to nip at the heels of children when they are playing. Pembrokes are prone to overeating. Their food intake should be monitored closely. Even though they are small dogs, Pembrokes have a lot of energy and need a healthy amount of exercise each day. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Originating in Pembrokeshire, Wales, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is an enchanting dog whose background is steeped in folklore. According to Welsh legend, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi sprang from the lairs of fairies and elves!As the legend goes, one day two children were out in the fields tending to their family"s cattle when they found a couple of puppies. The children thought they were foxes, but recognizing something different about them, bundled them up and took them home. Their parents immediately saw that the pups were not foxes, but dogs, and told their children that the pups were a gift from the fairies that lived in the fields. The fairies used them to pull their carriages and sometimes ride into battle.As proof that Pembrokes were indeed the mounts of fairies, the parents pointed to the marks on their backs where the fairy saddle had been placed on their shoulders. The children were delighted and cherished their pups. As they grew, the dogs became treasured companions and learned to help the children take care of the family"s cattle.For those who don"t believe in fairy tales, there are historians who say that the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is descended from Vallhunds, Swedish cattle dogs that were brought to Wales by the Vikings in the 9th and 10th centuries. Others think they may have been descended from dogs that were brought to Wales by Flemish weavers in the 12th century.Either way, the breed has a rather misty historical pedigree. Farmers who kept working dogs in the past bred the best dogs for the jobs they wanted them to do. They didn"t keep good records about the matings.In the 1920s, the UK Kennel Club recognized Corgis as purebred dogs. They were officially known as Welsh Corgis when exhibited for the first time in 1925. At that time, Pembrokes and Cardigans were shown in the same class as one breed.Then, in 1934, the Kennel Club recognized the Pembroke and the Cardigan as two separate breeds. In that same year, the American Kennel Club followed suit. Pembrokes were first shown in the U.S. in 1936.Pembrokes have slowly gained in popularity in the U.S., and today, are among the top 50 most popular breeds for family pets. They"re also popular with Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II of England, who received her first Pembroke Welsh Corgi from her father (King George VI) in 1933.The puppy"s name was Rozavel Golden Eagle and was a playmate for Elizabeth and her sister, Margaret. Elizabeth has loved the little dogs ever since, and currently has a pack of them lounging around Buckingham Palace.
Pembroke Welsh Corgis are between 10 and 12 inches tall at the shoulders, and weigh no more than 30 pounds.
Although Pembrokes are still used as working dogs, they are most often seen as family pets these days. They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. They are easy to train, but don"t expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves.Although they want to please their owners, food is a great motivator for them when training. Proceed with caution: Pembrokes love to eat and can become obese if their food intake isn"t moderated.Pembrokes also make good watchdogs. They can be suspicious of strangers, and will be quick to bark if they feel that something or someone is threatening their home and family.Like every dog, the Pembroke needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pembroke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Pembrokes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pembrokes will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Pembrokes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Cataracts: This affliction causes opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision Cutaneous Asthenia: Also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis, or dominant collagen dysplasia, this condition causes defective connective tissue in the skin to become fragile, loose, and stretchy. Blood vessels are also affected, leading to excessive bruising and blood blisters. Cystinuria: This is a condition where high levels of a protein, called cystine, are excreted in the urine, and may indicate stone formation. This is usually a problem only in males. Degenerative Myelopathy (DM): This is a progressive degeneration of the nervous and supportive tissue of the spinal cord in the lower back region. It causes rear leg lameness, weakness and eventual paralysis and is often misdiagnosed as disk disease. Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Intervertebral Disk Disease: Because of their long backs, Pembrokes are prone to ruptures in a spinal disk. Symptoms include unsteadiness, problems with going up or down stairs and furniture, knuckling over of limbs, weakness, and paralysis. Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) with Pulmonary Hypertension: PDA is a congenital defect of the vascular system that allows unoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs. It is usually detected in puppies during veterinary examination. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure within the lungs and is a rare part of the PDA disease. PDA can be surgically corrected. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Retinal Dysplasia: This is an abnormal development of the retina. Sometimes the retina may detach and cause blindness. Von Willebrand"s Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can"t be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.
Athletic and surprisingly fast, Pembrokes were bred to be herding dogs and require plenty of exercise each day. That said, they make fine apartment dogs as long as they get the physical stimulation they need.With their short legs and long backs, they should not be expected to hop up on (or down from) the couch or any other modest height — fractures are common.Pems can adapt quite easily to living in the country or the city. Although their coats are weather-resistant and they do well in most climates, they are very people-oriented, and need to be a part of the family at all times — not left alone in the backyard.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Pembrokes like to eat, and will over-indulge if given the chance. Keep your Pem in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Pembroke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Pembrokes are double-coated, with a thick undercoat and a longer topcoat. They shed continuously, with heavier shedding at least twice a year. You"ll find them in red, sable, black, tri-colored, or fawn, usually with white markings.The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Pems have fluffy coats — long with excessive feathering on the ears, chest, legs and feet.Many Pembrokes have what is called a "fairy saddle" over their back. This marking, which is caused by a change in thickness and direction of a strip of hair, gets its name from legend: According to one, fairies rode Pembrokes in their home country of Wales.Pembrokes are easy to groom, but shedding can be a problem if you don"t keep up with the brushing, especially during the heavier seasonal shedding. When they are shedding the most, daily brushing is recommended. You only need to bathe them as needed, but many people find that regular bathing also helps control heavy shedding.Brush your Pembroke"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Pembroke to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pembrokes have a remarkable affinity for children, but thanks to their herding instincts, they sometimes nip at children"s feet or ankles. Pems are eager learners, though, and can be trained out of this behavior at a young age.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They usually are good with other pets in the household, so long as they have been socialized with them.

The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen (pronounced peh-TEE bah-SAY grih-FON von-day-ON, and nicknamed the PBGV) has a rough, scruffy outline and distinctive long eyebrows, beard, and moustache. They are generally 13 to 15 inches tall, and their bodies are longer than they are tall. PBGVs were bred to hunt small game, such as rabbits, in rough terrain. The PBGV"s coat is moderately long, and harsh to the touch. They are a double-coated breed, and the undercoat is thick and soft. Coat color is white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tri-color, or grizzle markings. In addition to their charmingly tousled appearance, PBGVs have a delightful personality. They are active, happy, curious, and highly intelligent. They are affectionate dogs that need attention from people. They are great with children and people of all ages. They also get along well with other dogs and pets in your family when properly socialized. While PBGVs can have a mind of their own, they respond well to patient, consistent training methods. Bored or lonely PBGVs will find ways to entertain themselves, so it"s important to give yours a variety of toys and things to chew on, as well as keeping him in a safe place where he can"t harm himself or your possessions if you must leave him alone. As delightful as PBGVs are, you should know that according to the American Kennel Club breed standard (standardized guidelines for the breed), the PBGV has "a good voice freely used." It doesn"t take much to translate that into "He likes to bark!" If it"s any consolation, PBGVs usually just bark at something rather than barking just to hear their own voices. Also, like all hounds, the PBGV is governed by his nose. You should always keep your PBGV on a leash when walking in unfenced areas. All it takes is one enticing smell for him to be off on the hunt! They definitely need a fenced yard, but since some PBGVs are escape artists, you"ll need to be sure that it is at least four feet tall (so they can"t jump over it), and regularly inspect it for holes or areas where he might escape. Electric fences don"t deter a PBGV who has seen a rabbit or a squirrel just beyond the boundary. The momentary shock will go unnoticed as he wildly runs after prey. Another disadvantage of an invisible fence is that it doesn"t prevent other dogs from coming into your yard and harming your PBGV. PBGVs are pack animals at heart, and enjoy only one thing more than the company of another dog or pet — your company, of course!
PBGVs are charming and strong-headed. Consistent, patient training is essential. PBGVs can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended. This breed likes to bark. Don"t be surprised by the PBGV that has plenty to say. PBGVs have a lot of energy and stamina. They need exercise every day. They enjoy a good long walk, but don"t turn them off leash because you never know when their hunting instincts will kick in. PBGVs are escape artists! The nose rules! Like all hounds, the PBGV is driven by his nose. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen is one of many small varieties of the French hounds that were developed long ago. The PBGV can be traced back to the 16th century. His name is descriptive with "petit" meaning small, "basset" meaning low to the ground, "griffon" meaning wire-haired, and "vendeen" referring to the part of France where the breed originated. This area of France is on the country"s western coast, and is known for being a tough environment with a lot of thick underbrush, rocks and brambles. Although the breed had been in existence for centuries, breeders didn"t standardize the breed type until the last part of the 1800s. The official breed standard was adopted in 1898. At that time, they were called the Basset Griffon Francais. In 1907, when the Club du Basset Griffon Vendéen was formed, the same breed standard was used for both the Petit and Grand Basset Griffon, with the only difference being size. Often, both types were born in the same litter (the large and the small Griffons). In 1909, the club rewrote the standard to recognize two types of Basset. The Petit was to be 13 to 15 inches tall and the Grand was to be 15 to 17 inches tall. In the 1950s, the Societe de Venerie published a book of standards that included an official breed standard just for PBGVs. From that time on, they"ve been considered a separate breed from the Grands. Many breeders continued to breed Petits with Grands. However, Hubert Dezamy, third President of the French Basset club, rallied support to forbid this. Because of this recent interbreeding, litters today may include pups that have characteristics of both the Grand and Petit Bassets. PBGVs made their debut at the Westminster Kennel Club show in New York in 1992. The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen Club of America was formed at the AKC Centennial Show in Philadelphia in November 1984. By the end of 1985, the club"s membership had grown from 11 to 50 members, and a breed standard had been drafted. On July 1, 1989, the PBGV became eligible to compete in AKC Miscellaneous class (dogs allowed to compete in the Miscellaneous class are recognized by the AKC, but are not yet eligible to be awarded points towards an AKC championship. It"s a sort of a testing ground for the breed, and many breeds remain in the Miscellaneous class for several years). On February 1, 1991, the breed received full recognition by the AKC and was entered into the Hound group at that time.
Males and females stand 13 to 15 inches tall, and weigh 30 to 40 pounds.
The PBGV is known as the "happy breed." This breed enjoys life and people. He is enthusiastic and good-natured. The PBGV is also an active breed. Unlike some other hounds in his group (Basset, for example) that are typically laid back, the PBGV is busy, and requires an active owner to keep him occupied. PBGVs can be willful, but they are generally so charming about it that you end up laughing instead of scolding them. If you want him to be well-trained, you"ll need to be patient and firm. PBGVs are good watchdogs because they love to bark! It"s wise to train them to be quiet on command. PBGVs are very curious dogs that also happen to be great escape artists. If they can, they will either go over a fence, or under it by digging. A tall fence is recommended, plus regular checks of the fence to make sure the PBGV isn"t digging an escape tunnel.
PBGVs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all PBGVs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In PBGVs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). PBGV Pain Syndrome: This is a miserable condition that affects 6- to 18-month-old dogs. Symptoms include bouts of pain, fever, and/or listlessness. The intensity of the pain varies from very mild in some dogs to quite severe in others. Some dogs suffer only a single episode, but most affected dogs have several. One of the more severe forms of this condition affects the cervical area of the neck, giving the problem its common names: the "neck thing" and, more formally, steroid-responsive meningitis. Most dogs outgrow the problem, but some can suffer permanent complications. Epilepsy: This is a puzzling condition that causes dogs to experience seizures for no apparent reason. Some affected dogs experience only one or a few seizures during their lifetime, while others have seizure a regular basis. If necessary, this condition can usually (but not always) be managed successfully with medication. Glaucoma and lens luxation. Glaucoma and lens luxation are eye problems that have been identified in PBGVs only recently. In glaucoma, the pressure inside the eyeball increases and eventually damages the optic nerve, causing blindness. In lens luxation, the lens tilts out if its normal position, causing blindness. Usually, both eyes are affected. These conditions strike dogs around 5 years of age and generally occur together. Allergies: In PBGVs, allergies manifest themselves primarily as chronic inflammation of the ears or as redness of the feet or armpits. In addition to these non-specific allergies, PBGVs can suffer from food allergy, fleabite allergy, hay fever, and vaccine reactions. Most allergies cause only itching, but in some cases, dogs can suffer a great deal of discomfort. Be especially watchful of your dog for a several hours after he has been vaccinated. Inguinal and Umbilical Hernias: Inguinal and umbilical hernias are defects of the abdomen muscles that allow internal organs to protrude and form a bubble under the skin on the belly (umbilical hernia) or in the groin (inguinal hernia). The condition sometimes corrects itself as the puppy grows, but surgery may be required. Patellar Luxation and Hip Dysplasia: Patellar luxation ("trick knee") and hip dysplasia are caused by the abnormal development of the knee and hip joints, respectively. Patellar luxation, also called slipping kneecaps, is more common in PBGVs than hip dysplasia. Either can lead to lameness and arthritis in old age. Your vet will be able to tell if this is a potential problem and may want to do x-rays to evaluate the condition. Treatment often consists of giving the dog nutritional supplements, and may occasionally require surgery. Hypothyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn"t produce enough thyroid hormones. Symptoms include obesity, lethargy, poor coat quality, dry, scaly skin, intolerance to cold and, some think, irritability or aggression. Middle-age and older dogs appear to be the most affected, but symptoms can appear at any age. This condition usually can be effectively treated with medication. Persistent Pupillary Pembranes (PPM) and Multifocal Retinal Dysplasia: Persistent pupillary membranes and multifocal retinal dysplasia (retinal folds) are congenital eye defects. Fortunately, the dog"s vision usually isn"t affected, many consider these primarily cosmetic defects.
Because of their small size and love of being with people, PBGVs can be apartment dwellers as long as you make the commitment to daily exercise. They are generally active when inside the house, so it good to have plenty of sturdy toys on hand. While they do well in most climates, they prefer cooler temperatures. The breed"s nose and hunting instinct is strong, so the PBGV should not be allowed to run off-leash. A secure, fenced yard is best.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your PBGV, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The PBGV"s coat is rough, medium long, and harsh to the touch, while his undercoat is thick, soft and short. He has long eyebrows that stick out so they don"t obscure the eyes, and the ears are covered with long hair. They also have long hair around their mouths, forming a beard and moustache. Their tails have quite a bit of hair, too. Overall, the PBGV has a casual, tousled appearance. PBGVs come in a wide range of colors and can be white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tricolor, or grizzle markings. Grooming is a cinch. PBGVs need to be brushed at least once a week to remove loose and dead hair, and control shedding. You should bathe your PBGV only when needed. The toenails need to be trimmed periodically, and ears checked and cleaned as needed. No trimming is necessary.
The friendly PBGV loves children. He enjoys the noise and activity associated with children. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets; this is especially important with the PBGV is ensure that gates or doors are not left open, giving him an opportunity to escape. The PBV can be trustworthy with other pets, given proper training and socialization. He especially enjoys the companionship of other dogs. He is a hunter at heart, though, and is likely to chase small animals that run away.

The Pharaoh Hound has a remarkable personality characterized by an immense joy of life. Intelligent and affectionate, he takes life as it comes and enjoys clowning for his people. As with any hound, he has moments of aloofness and can be strong-willed. But in the main he"s a gentle dog who gets along well with others, including children and other dogs. He loves human companionship and will seek out affection and attention from his people while still maintaining his independence. One of his most endearing traits is his ability to blush. You may spot a deep rose color on his nose and ears when he"s excited, happy, or enjoying some affection. Many owners will train their Pharaoh Hounds to smile. Since this fun-loving breed enjoys smiling so much, it isn"t a hard trick to teach. While he"s too friendly to serve as a guard dog, the Pharaoh Hound will bark to alert you to anyone or anything that seems suspicious. Unfortunately, a lot of things look suspicious to a Pharaoh Hound. He"ll also bark if he"s left alone for too long or when he"s bored, so it"s best not to leave him alone for long periods. It"s wise to keep this dog on leash whenever he"s in an unfenced area. Even if he obeys your every command at home, his prey instinct is so strong he"ll be off — and temporarily deaf to your commands — if he spots anything interesting.
Introduce your Hound to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences, preferably as a puppy. He can be sensitive to changes in schedules and stress, and an unsocialized dog has a harder time adapting to abrupt changes. A properly socialized is a polite and undemanding dog who is wonderful with strangers and other dogs. Pharaoh Hounds can get cold very easily, but they can live in a chilly climate if they"re kept indoors and wear a warm coat on wintertime walks. Don"t let your Pharaoh Hound run off-leash in an unfenced area. He"s got a strong prey drive and will chase other animals for miles. Backyard fences should be too high to jump or climb, and preferably solid so he can"t see through it. Underground electronic fencing won"t stop a Pharaoh Hound with something interesting in his sights. Pharaoh Hounds can do well in homes with other canines but smaller dogs may trigger their prey drive — as will small pets such as cats and rabbits — and some Pharaoh Hounds are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender. Although sighthounds are not known as barkers, the Pharaoh Hound is an exception. They bark when chasing prey, when they see intruders or hear an unusual noise, or when bored. They can indulge in long bark-a-thons, usually when you"re away from the house, which could cause problems if you live in a place with noise restrictions or neighbors that could be disturbed. Pharaoh Hounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog. The thin coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears and nicks. Coprophagia, better known as stool eating, is commonly seen in the Pharaoh Hound. The best way to avoid this habit is to scoop the poop right away. Pharaoh Hounds require at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Pharaoh Hound is an ancient breed that originated in Egypt, and many reminders of its long history can be found in art and literature. An artifact from 4000 BC depicts two Pharaoh Hound-shaped dogs hunting gazelles; a dog resembling the Pharaoh Hound was often depicted as the companion of kings and nobles in ancient Egyptian art; and a letter dating to the 19th Egyptian dynasty mentions a red long-tailed dog whose face glows like a God, a reference no doubt to the breed"s habit of blushing. From Egypt, the Pharaoh Hound was imported into Malta by Phoenician traders. There they were called the "Kelb tal-Fenek," meaning "dog of the rabbit," after the prey the local hunters used the dog to catch. The breed thrived and became the official dog of Malta. The Pharaoh Hound remained largely unknown in the west until arriving in England in the 1930s. The first Pharaoh Hounds were imported into the U.S. in 1967. The Pharaoh Hound Club of America was founded in 1970, and the breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1984. The Pharaoh Hound is still an uncommon breed, but he can be found throughout the world, wherever people appreciate his unique appearance and personality.
The athletic Pharaoh Hound has a lithe and powerful build. They should be slightly longer than they are tall, with males standing 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder, females 21 to 24 inches. Pharaoh Hounds generally weigh 45 to 55 pounds.
Pharaoh Hounds love their own people and happily entertain them with their clownish antics. The flip side is that they can be aloof with new people. This is a dog who likes to have his own way. Still, he"s smart and willing to please — most of the time — which generally makes training easy. The Pharaoh Hound can be a bit of a sensitive plant. He picks up on people"s feelings and may find a high-drama home very stressful. It"s always important to introduce a dog to lots of new people and situations as a puppy, but this is particularly true with a Pharaoh who can grow up to be timid. Enroll your Hound in a class. Help him polish his social skills, and invite visitors over regularly, and take him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors.
Pharaoh Hounds are generally healthy, but as with breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pharaoh Hounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Pharaoh Hounds are not as sensitive to anesthesia as other sighthounds, but your veterinarian should be aware of the potential risks. The most important rule is to administer to effectiveness not weight. Because of their low body fat, sighthounds can be sensitive to anesthesia, and what would be a normal dose for another dog of his weight can harm or even kill a sighthound. Pharaoh Hounds are less sensitive than some other breeds, but you"ll need to find a vet who"s aware of the risks and knows how to dose your dog properly if he ever needs anesthesia. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pharaoh Hounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).
With their calm nature, Pharaoh Hounds can live in an apartment or condo, though his barking has the potential to annoy close neighbors. If you leave him in a yard, you"ll need a fence that"s too high for him to climb or jump, preferably solid so he can"t see the squirrels or cats on the other side. Electronic fencing won"t cut it with this breed — no shock will stop a Pharaoh Hound once he decides to chase something. Because of his thin skin, he gets cold easily and will need a dog sweater or jacket when venturing out on cold or wet days. If you want a well-behaved dog, you"ll need to make sure your high-energy Pharaoh Hound gets at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. This dog can participate in lure coursing and agility, or come with you on a family jog or bike ride. Just make sure you keep him on a leash whenever you"re in an unfenced area. If he sees something small and furry, his strong prey drive will overcome the best training every time. When he"s not distracted by something chase-worthy, however, his intelligence and eagerness to please makes him fairly easy to train. Just make sure you keep lesson time interesting and pleasant; harsh or repetitive training methods don"t work with his sensitive, fun-loving personality. Keep training sessions short and end with something he"s done right so you can praise him for it.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Don"t be fooled into overfeeding; sighthounds have a slim build that many mistake as being underweight. Some Pharaoh Hounds suffer from food allergies; if your dog"s one of them, your vet can recommend a special diet. Keep your Pharaoh Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Pharaoh Hound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pharaoh Hound has a short coat with a fine to slightly harsh texture. His color ranges from a rich tan to a chestnut tan. He may have a dab of white on the tip of the tail, the toes, the chest, or on the center of the face. The Pharaoh Hound sheds (as do all dogs) but a weekly brushing with a hound glove — a rubber mitt with a nubby palm that fits over the hand — removes loose hair and helps keep it from settling on your clothes and furniture. Pharaoh Hounds don"t have a strong doggy odor and don"t need frequent baths. Unless he"s been rolling around in something stinky, wiping him down daily with a damp cloth will in most cases keep him clean. Your Pharaoh Hound"s skin will need some care too. The short coat isn"t very protective, and cuts, scrapes, and other irritations are common. Check your dog for nicks and cuts every time you brush him. Brush your Pharaoh Hound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Check his ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Introduce your Pharaoh Hound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pharaoh Hounds are very affectionate with children. Nonetheless, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Pharaoh Hounds generally get along with other dogs, although some are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender. And because they see small animals as prey, Pharaoh Hounds aren"t suited to sharing a roof with small pets such as rabbits or cats, or even smaller dogs.

You might say the Plott Hound is a dog of a different color. He stands out from the other coonhounds not only for his short brindle or black with brindle coat but also for being the only coonhound not descended from foxhounds. In fact, he"s really more of a big game hound than a coonhound, and Plott people say it"s almost a sin to coonhunt a Plott. This uncommon breed was born and bred in the good ole US of A, but he comes from a type of German bloodhound, the Hanoverian Schweisshund, a breed brought to western North Carolina in 1750 by Johannes Georg Plott, from whom the dogs take their name. The Plott Hound is known for his powerful, streamlined body, intelligence, loyalty, and eager-to-please nature. The nature of the prey he was created to track — bear and wild boar — means that he"s not only strong but fierce in the hunt. That can translate to dominant and aggressive behavior if he"s not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — and trained by someone who can keep him in line with firm and consistent guidance as well as positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior. Plotts are fearless and more protective than the average hound. They"re loyal to their people and will protect their property, but they"re also affectionate enough to be friendly with everyone they meet. They do well in homes with children, although they"re best suited to living with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Plotts can be possessive of their food bowls, and this can pose a problem if a young child tries to snag a handful of kibble. Plott Hounds do very well in homes with multiple dogs and even multiple pets if they are introduced at a young age. They are a pack dog and enjoy the comforts and companionship that living in a pack offers them. Plotts are not necessarily quiet dogs. They have a sharp, high-pitched voice, especially when they scent prey. That"s something to consider if you have neighbors nearby. Due to his dominant streak, the Plott Hound is not a breed for an inexperienced or timid owner. He has his challenges as many other breeds do and it is important to be aware of his limitations as well as the traits that make him an interesting breed. The Plott Hound generally has an even disposition, and given a fenced acreage to roam — or a fenced yard and plenty of exercise — plus a strong leader and, ideally, opportunities to hunt, he"s happy being one of the family.
Plott Hounds generally get along well with other dogs since they are a pack breed and many do best in homes where they are not an only dog. Socialization is a must for this breed. They can be very dominant and should be socialized outside the home to avoid aggressive behavior. Plott Hounds must have training at an early age. They are generally eager to please but without training dominance and aggression problems can arise. Although they do well with older children who understand how to treat dogs, they are not recommended for homes with smaller children. They can become very possessive of food dishes and such. Even the best-trained or socialized dog should not be left alone with a young child. The Plott Hound is an uncommon breed and there may be long waiting lists for a puppy. If you do not wish to adopt an older dog, please be prepared to wait and do not go to irresponsible breeders for a shorter wait. Plott Hounds require at least an hour a day of walking or other exercise. They are not suited to living in apartments. Plott Hounds require weekly brushing as well as other regular grooming care, such as nail trimming and tooth brushing. Plott Hounds are not the best breed for an inexperienced or timid dog owner. Although they are very easy to train, they do have a dominant personality and will disregard an owner that is less sure of him or herself. Plott Hounds should have a fenced yard or be kept on leash since they have a tendency to wander off in pursuit of an interesting scent. They do not have any road sense and will wander into oncoming traffic if their path takes them there. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Plott Hound descends from five Hanoverian Schweisshunds brought to North Carolina in 1750 by German immigrant Johannes Georg Plott. In Germany the dogs had been used as boarhounds, but North Carolina had bears, and that"s what Plott trained his dogs to hunt. Plott"s descendants continued to breed the dogs, and they became known as Plott"s hounds. They spread throughout the Smoky Mountains, with each hunter adding his own touch to the breed, and eventually returned to their roots by being used to hunt wild boar in addition to bear. They were also used to hunt mountain lions and, with judicious crosses to add better treeing ability, raccoons. In the early 1900s, a cross with some black-and-tan hounds owned by a man named Blevins brought the Plotts additional scenting talent as well as the black-saddled brindle pattern. Today, most Plott Hounds trace their pedigrees back to the two legendary hounds that resulted from this cross: Tige and Boss. The breed began to be registered by the United Kennel Club in 1946. The Plott Hound became the official dog of North Carolina in 1989. He"s also registered by the American Kennel Club and is starting to make his way in the show ring. He is still relatively rare, however, and is most often found in the mountains of Appalachia, the Smokies, and other wild parts of the country where his hunting skills are appreciated.
Male Plotts stand 20 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 75 pounds; females stand 20 to 25 inches and weigh 40 to 65 pounds.
The Plott is described as bright, kind, confident, and courageous. He"s loyal to his family and somewhat wary of strangers although he usually warms up quickly to them. He gets along all right with other dogs, but he"s not as friendly toward them as many other hound breeds. You will often see a difference in temperament between Plotts bred for going after big game and those bred to tree raccoons, with the big game dogs having a sharper edge. Like every hound, the Plott has a mind of his own and requires firm, consistent guidance, but in general he wants to please his people. He"s protective of his home and family and makes an excellent watchdog. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Plott Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Plott puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Plotts are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Plotts will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Plotts, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death if it isn"t treated.
Although Plott Hounds have moderately low energy indoors, they are active outside. If you don"t have a several fenced acres that they can explore and sniff, expect to give them about an hour of exercise daily. You can break it up into two or three walks or playtimes. The Plott is a walking companion, not a jogger. He likes to meander along and sniff out interesting trails. Plott Hounds should remain on leash when they are not in an enclosed area and they should have a fenced yard when they are left outside. They will wander away, and they have no road sense. They"ll follow an interesting trail right into the path of a car. While a Plott needs a fenced yard for safety, he"s not a yard dog. When you"re home, he should be there with you. Plott Hounds are fairly easy to train due to their intelligence and eager to please temperament. They do have a dominant streak and are not suggested for inexperienced or timid dog owners who are unable to consistently enforce rules and commands. They do well with positive reinforcement, and corrections should never be harsh or cruel. That will only make your Plott become stubborn or sulky. Plott Hounds must be socialized to prevent any aggression problems. Many obedience schools offer puppy socialization classes and this is a great start. Also remember to gradually expose your puppy to various stimuli within the community and in your home. Plotts can be possessive of their food dishes and will attack other dogs and animals that nose around their food. Teaching your Plott Hound to allow people to handle and remove his food dishes is an important training step that cannot be missed. Crate training your Plott Hound will assist in housetraining and protect your belongings from destruction. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Plott doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Plott accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Plott in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Plotts are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Leash training is a must for this breed with its tendency to wander and lack of road sense. With proper training, socialization, and consistent rules, you will find that the Plott Hound is not only a never-say-die hunting companion but also a wonderful foot warmer at night.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether your Plott is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. Plotts are one of the breeds prone to gastric dilatation-volvulus, more commonly known as bloat. Feed them two or three times a day rather than once a day, and never let them exercise immediately after a meal. For more on feeding your Plott, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Plott Hound has a smooth coat with hair that ranges in texture from fine to medium coarse. The thick double coat provides plenty of protection against wet or cold weather, a necessity for a hunting dog bred in the mountains of North Carolina. Plott Hounds mostly come in any shade of brindle, which is a coat patterned with specks and streaks of light and dark markings. Brindles can be tan, chocolate, yellow, buckskin, chocolate, orange, gray, blue, liver, brown, and black. You might see a brindle with a black saddle or a black with brindle trim. They can also be solid black or an unusual color called buckskin, which comes in a range of shades: light cream, sandy red, yellow ochre, red fawn, dark fawn or golden tan. Whatever color a Plott is, you might occasionally see a little bit of white on the chest and feet. Plott Hounds are easy to groom. A good brushing once a week with a hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand — or rubber curry brush will leave their coat gleaming. Plott Hounds don"t shed excessively, but that weekly brushing will help keep dead hair off your clothes and furniture. Plott Hounds do not need frequent bathing and can be washed with a dry or foam shampoo. On the occasions when you do give a water bath, use a shampoo formulated for dogs to ensure that the natural oils aren"t stripped from the coat. Because the Plott"s floppy ears can block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Plott may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Brush your Plott"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Plott Hound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Plott to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Plott Hounds do well in homes with children, although they"re best suited to living with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Plotts can be possessive of their food bowls, and this can pose a problem if a young child tries to snag a handful of kibble. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Plott Hounds can get along well with other dogs if they"re introduced at a young age. If they raised with them, they can even learn to get along with cats, although they may tree cats they find outside.

As early as the 13th century, nobles hunted with packs of tiny Beagles. Known as "glove Beagles," because they reportedly fit in the palm of a heavy leather hunting glove, they were eventually replaced by the 13-inch and 15-inch Beagles we know today. Some modern-day breeders have attempted to recreate the little hounds, resulting in dogs that are referred to as mini Beagles or olde English pocket Beagles. Whatever his size, it"s difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle"s dark brown or hazel eyes, with their soft, pleading expression. These are happy, outgoing, and loving dogs, characteristics that help balance their inquisitive, determined, and food-focused hound nature. They aren"t yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization is usually reserved for when they catch sight of quarry, or decide to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and their human friends and are inclined to think everyone is their new best friend. The most important thing to know about any size Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his anatomy, and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once famously described his in-laws" Beagle as "a nose with feet." All Beagles of any size need frequent daily walks or active play periods. Expect to give a pocket Beagle at least an hour of exercise daily. And be warned that this isn"t a breed that walks briskly. Beagles mosey, nose to the ground, sniffing out everything around them. Beagles who are left alone and infrequently exercised become destructive. Just because they"re small doesn"t mean they can"t do a number on your décor.
Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate-training is absolutely recommended. Beagles are very intelligent and can get bored if left alone too long. If left outside alone in a backyard, Beagles usually will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to find ways to get out and find some people or other dogs to play with. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling. The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners" neighbors got tired of their baying. Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and then perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped! Beagles are scenthounds and will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world. Although loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist). Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are "chow hounds" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best. Teach children to respect your Beagle while he"s eating, and not to approach or tease him with food. A Beagle takes his food bowl pretty seriously. Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they"re usually friendly to everyone they meet.
The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain. It"s thought that it may have been derived from the French word begueule, meaning open throat, or from the Old English word beag, meaning small. Others think it may have come from the French word beugler, meaning to bellow, or the German word begele, meaning to scold. The breed"s history is cloudy as well because breeds as we know them today didn"t really develop until the 19th century. But Greek documents from 400 B.C. describe Beagle-like dogs, and the Romans may have brought small rabbit-hunting hounds with them to England and bred them with the local hounds. William the Conqueror reportedly brought Talbot hounds (now extinct) to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the Beagle and the Foxhound. Beagles became popular in England early in its history. During the reigns of Edward II (1307 AD - 1327 AD) and Henry VII (1485 AD - 1509 AD), extremely small beagles, called Glove Beagles — small enough to be held in a gloved hand — were popular. There"s also mention of Singing Beagles, named for their bugling voices. Elizabeth I (1533-1603) kept packs of Pocket Beagles who stood only 9 inches tall. These small dogs were depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy nosed. They were used for hunting, but quickly fell out of favor because they weren"t very fast. In the 1700s, fox hunting became popular in England, and the Beagle was supplanted by the larger Foxhound. If it hadn"t been for the farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales who continued to keep packs to hunt rabbit and hare, the breed might have become extinct at that time. In the mid-1800s Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a pack of Beagles in Essex, England. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the modern Beagle. Rev. Honeywood bred for hunting skills, not looks. Thomas Johnson, a fellow Englishman, was responsible for breeding Beagles that were both attractive and good hunters. At about the same time, American breeders started importing Beagles from England to improve the looks of their own dogs. Many of the English imports were bred to an average height of 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder so they could hunt fox. American breeders started breeding them to be smaller for rabbit hunting. Of interest among these rabbit-hunters is the "Patch" Beagle strain, which was developed by Willet Randall in New York around 1880. The line is primarily white with a very large tri-colored spot. They were very popular in the 1940s and 1950s because they were able to run so fast. Today, many people call lemon and white or red and white beagles "Patch" beagles. The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club both were founded in 1884. In that same year, the AKC began registering Beagles. Beagles compete in one of two different height classes: Beagles 13 inches tall and under compete in the 13 inch class and Beagles between 13 and 15 inches tall compete in the 15 inch class. The American Kennel Club does not recognize a variety called the Pocket Beagle. Technically, the Pocket Beagle qualifies as a 13-inch Beagle, which is defined by the Beagle breed standard as any Beagle that doesn"t exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder and typically weighs 15 to 18 pounds.
Breeders of Pocket Beagles put their height at 7 to 12 inches and weight at 7 to 15 pounds.
Beagles are gentle and sweet, smart and funny. They will make you laugh — that is when they"re not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and are often forced to resort to food rewards to lure their hounds into a state of temporary obedience. As with every dog, Beagles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your pocket Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
As with all dog breeds, the Beagle is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions, and Pocket Beagles have more than most. While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Beagles, it is imperative to do your research to find a Beagle who"s been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she"s taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy"s parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, knees, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. So look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Pocket Beagles: Eye disorders including cherry eye, a common condition in which the gland of the third eyelid swells; glaucoma, an increase in the pressure of the fluid inside of the eye; cataracts, a clouded film over the eye lens; retinal dysplasia, a folding or displacement of the retina that can lead to blindness; and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells, which progresses to blindness. Beagles also can suffer from Distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing. Epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures, is fairly common in Beagles. Hypothyroidism, a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues, also is common in the breed. Beagle Dwarfism, which means the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs. Funny Puppy syndrome is a condition where a puppy is much smaller than its littermates and may require special feedings and treatments to survive. They often exhibit soreness in their feet and legs and may not be able to walk normally. Sometimes, these puppies grow up to be sickly dogs, but sometimes they show no signs of problems when mature. Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS) is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities. Cleft Lip or Palate: The lip or palate isn"t completely closed, causing the dog to have difficulty eating, drinking, and breathing. Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testicles to descend from the abdomen. When you have your dog neutered, your vet will be able to remove the undescended testicles, thereby helping your dog avoid health problems that might arise from this condition. Hermaphroditism, the presence of both male and female chromosomes and tissue. Canine Hip Dysplasia, an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Epiphyseal Dysplasia, characterized by abnormally slow growth in the rear legs; sometimes causes soreness. Intervertebral Disc DiseaseI (IDD): Ruptured discs in the spine cause pain and paralysis. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. Patellar luxation ranges from a minor annoyance that causes little pain to a cripping defect.
A pocket Beagle is every bit as much a scenthound as his larger brethren, which means that when outside he should always be on a leash in unconfined areas. He"s a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he"s microchipped and wearing I.D. tags so he can be returned to you. Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn"t prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it. Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply tune out when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat. Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love going for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have adequately trained your dog to come back to you!). They can enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they are 18 months or older before starting them on such a repetitive exercise, or they could experience joint damage. When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, and getting up mostly for meals and an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed is prone to obesity, it"s not a good idea to let this happen.
Recommended daily amount: 7/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they"re willing to eat until they pop. To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Beagle at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your pocket Beagle will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The breed standard for Beagles says any hound color is acceptable. Hound colors include all shades and combinations of white or cream, black, tan, lemon, red, brown, liver, blue, and gray. The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle. The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs, and tip of the tail. All colors can have freckling, mottling (dark roundish blotches on a lighter background), ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), and grizzling (a mixture of black or red and white hairs). Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they"re hunting in tall grass. Although you and I might think a Beagle has a short coat, it"s actually classified as medium length. It"s also smooth, dense, and resistant to rain. Beagles are clean dogs, unless, of course, they"ve found something appealingly stinky to roll in. Otherwise, they don"t require frequent baths. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth. Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it usually isn"t as noticeable as with other breeds. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring. Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn"t circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections, so don"t allow water or oils to enter his ears. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears. You should check your Beagle"s nails once a week and trim them if they are getting long.
Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children. In addition, Beagles tend to be "mouthy," grabbing things, like a child"s hand, with their mouths. They are doing this in fun and can be taught not to do this. Pocket beagles are small and can be easily injured. Make it a rule that young children can hold them only while sitting on the floor. That helps ensure that the dog doesn"t get dropped or carried around like a rag doll. It"s also important never to leave dogs and young children together without supervision. They can hurt each other without meaning to. Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don"t like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.

Affectionately known as the "Royal Dog of Scotland," it is not difficult to imagine how this breed, with its athletic, well-muscled build, came by the title. The Scottish Deerhound has a romantic past, a noble bearing, and a loving nature, so much so that Sir Walter Scott — himself the owner of deerhound named Maida — described the breed as "the most perfect creature of Heaven." What is the allure of this large dog, with his wiry coat and greyhound-type build? Much of it can"t be answered in words but must be witnessed firsthand. The Scottish Deerhound is affectionate toward everyone — family, friends, and strangers alike. He loves children and usually does well with other dogs, although the larger the better. With his long legs, he enjoys a nice jog with a human companion, but afterward is happy to laze around on the sofa and snooze in a sunny spot. This gentle dog has an elegant and polite air but is never aloof. While he"s undoubtedly loyal and courageous, he doesn"t make the best watchdog. His size might be intimidating to someone who doesn"t know him, but he"s too loving and friendly to pose any threat, and it rarely occurs to him to bark when someone approaches his home. He"s highly active as a puppy, but by the time he"s 3 to 5 years old he morphs into a couch potato. Nonetheless, he still requires long walks daily to maintain his tall, gangly body. The Scottish Deerhound is kind enough for people who are inexperienced with dogs, but even a novice should understand that he"s not the easiest breed to train. Deerhounds are lazy and approach training with a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. Although they have a reputation for not doing well in obedience or agility competitions, they can succeed in these arenas if their trainers are willing to put in hard work and consistent training. Scottish Deerhounds may also be slower than other breeds when it comes to housetraining, but the same patience and consistency that gives you a well-trained dog will be an asset with this step in training. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living despite their calm indoor nature. They do best when they have a large yard to run in, and the yard should be fenced to prevent them from chasing "prey" into the street. Underground electronic fencing should not be used with this breed; no shock will stop them once they go into chase mode. They"re best suited to homes without cats or other small pets that may trigger their prey drive. If you can meet the special needs of a giant breed built for speed, the Scottish Deerhound is a devoted companion who will fill your life with all the love his large and dignified heart can give.
Scottish Deerhounds need a securely fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey. Underground electronic fencing will not prevent them from giving chase. The Scottish Deerhound is not recommended in homes with smaller animals and pets that could be considered as "prey." If they are not properly socialized, and for some Scottish Deerhounds even socialization does not curb it, they will give chase whenever they see the other animal. This could result in the smaller animal being killed or injured. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels indoors, they are a large dog and require lots of room to run. They require daily exercise and do best in a home with a large yard or acreage. Scottish Deerhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing a moving animal, but be aware that they can and will lift you off your feet if they do decide to take off and you"re hanging on to the leash. The Scottish Deerhound is a very affectionate breed and will generally befriend everyone he meets. He gets along well with other dogs if they are large and don"t trigger his prey drive. He doesn"t make the best alert or guard dog because of his loving nature. Housetraining can take a bit longer with the Scottish Deerhound than with other breeds. Be patient and consistent. Scottish Deerhounds are relatively inactive inside but still need a lot of daily exercise to maintain their huge bodies. They make great jogging companions and enjoy long, long walks. Many people are surprised when their active Scottish Deerhound puppy turns into a couch potato adult. Scottish Deerhounds do very well with older children, but take into account their size and energy level when they"re outdoors. Don"t let a child walk a Scottish Deerhound; he won"t be able to hang onto him if he decides to run after something. Regardless of breed, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The origins of the Scottish Deerhound are lost in the Highland mists. Over the centuries, they"ve been known as Irish wolfdogs, Scottish greyhounds, rough greyhounds, and Highland deerhounds. Whether they were originally used to hunt wolves and then repurposed to hunt the great stags of the Highlands is unknown, but we do know that they were used as far back as the 16th century to hunt and bring down deer. The deerhounds were highly regarded for their courage and gentle dignity. A nobleman condemned to death could purchase his life with a gift of deerhounds. And only a nobleman could do so; no one beneath the rank of earl could lay claim to a deerhound, which was commonly known as the Royal Dog of Scotland. The breed suffered under its restricted ownership, however, and there were many times it came close to extinction, most nearly when the clan system of Scotland collapsed in 1745 after the fateful battle of Culloden during the Jacobite rebellion against English rule. By 1769 the breed was in dire straits. Efforts were made to restore the breed to its original glory in the 1820s by Archibald and Duncan McNeill. The breed made its way to America as well. The first Scottish Deerhound registered by the American Kennel Club was Bonnie Robin in 1886. During World War I, the breed suffered another decline in numbers when many large estates in Scotland and England were broken up. The Scottish Deerhound became a rare breed again, enjoyed only by a select few. Today the Scottish Deerhound is still a fairly uncommon breed, appreciated by those who love sighthounds or have an interest because of their Scottish heritage, but more are coming to learn that this is a versatile breed and an all-around exceptional dog. Today the Scottish Deerhound ranks 135th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
The average height for a Scottish Deerhound is 30 to 32 inches for a male and from 28 inches and up for a female. Males weigh 85 to 110 pounds, females 75 to 95 pounds.
The Scottish Deerhound can best be described as chivalrous. He"s gentle yet strong, sensitive yet brave. Loyal, devoted, quiet, dignified, and alert are all terms that apply to this dog. He is courageous in the face of danger but never aggressive. Of course, those characteristics don"t just appear. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Scottish Deerhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Deerhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Scottish Deerhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Deerhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Deerhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Scottish Deerhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is believed to be related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of a Scottish Deerhound is generally too high a dose for the low-body-fat Deerhound. It is important to choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds and will be aware of how to dose your Scottish Deerhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, take the time to alert them to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It"s identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred. Osteosarcoma: Most often affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is a lameness in the limb, but the dog will require x-rays to determine the cause. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. Factor VII Deficiency: Factor VII deficiency causes excessive and sometimes fatal bleeding from minor wounds and surgery. A DNA test to identify carriers of Factor VII deficiency is available. This genetic abnormality is present at birth and doesn"t change, so a test at any age is accurate for the dog"s entire life. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Deerhounds are especially prone to inhalant allergies. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.
Scottish Deerhounds are calm and sedate. They enjoy a good run or a long walk, but in the main they"re more mellow than manic. They"ll enjoy any game that involves chasing something, although you shouldn"t expect them to bring it back. Because they"re a giant breed, it"s important to introduce puppies to exercise gradually so you don"t damage their still developing bones and joints. Deerhound puppies need plenty of off-leash exercise in a safely fenced area to develop properly. Give them unrestricted access to a large yard so they can get out and run when the mood strikes them. Start them on walks when they"re 8 weeks old and gradually work them up to a mile or more by the time they"re 12 weeks old. By 6 months of age, they"ll be capable and desirous of much longer walks. They should be two years old before they begin any type of jumping or running. Avoid exercising them on hard surfaces such as concrete as much as possible. In the house, they need a puppy-proofed room where they can stretch out and play, yet not do too much damage. When you"re not there to supervise, confine them to it with a tall dog gate or baby gate. Long hours in a crate can damage their joints. Scottish Deerhounds are not the easiest of breeds to train and require patience and understanding. They enjoy the attention they receive when you"re happy with their behavior, but all in all they"d rather do what they like. They are sensitive and won"t respond to harsh treatment. Positive reinforcement with food rewards, praise, and play is the best training technique to use with this breed, and it"s important to be consistent. With a trainer who"s patient and has a sense of humor, they"ve been known to achieve advanced titles in obedience. Leash training is a must with the Scottish Deerhound. Your Scottish Deerhound must be leashed on walks or his prey drive will kick in when he sees a small animal in motion. Once that happens, nothing will matter to him but the chase, no matter how many frantic commands you shout. While it"s breathtaking to see a Deerhound in action, it"s heartbreaking if he becomes injured in the chase, hurts or kills the animal he"s pursuing, or runs in front of a car and is killed. If you want to see him run and chase, get him involved in lure coursing.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether your Deerhound"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Deerhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The thick coat of a Scottish Deerhound is 3 to 4 inches long, harsh and wiry, meant to protect the dog as he hunted the rough terrain of the Scottish Highlands. In contrast, the hair on the head, belly, and breast is usually quite soft. A slight fringe of hair — not enough to be called feathering — adorns the backs of the legs. Climate affects the texture of the coat, and in the United States Deerhounds commonly have a coat that is a mix of wiry and silky hair. No self-respecting Deerhound has a woolly coat, however, which doesn"t shed dirt the way the wiry coat does. The typical Deerhound wears a coat of dark blue-gray, but the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look — says he also comes in dark gray, brindle, light gray, red fawn, sandy red, or yellow. The latter three colors are especially attractive when the dog has a black muzzle and ears, but it"s unlikely you"ll ever see it. Most Deerhounds come in only three colors: gray, gray, and gray. Once in a while you"ll see a bit of white on the chest or toes, but the less white the better. Scottish Deerhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush the coat with a wire slicker brush once or twice a week to remove dead hair, stimulate the circulation, and distribute natural skin oils. Always brush in the direction the hair grows. Give a final going over with a metal comb — known as a greyhound comb — to be sure you haven"t missed any tangles. You can also use the comb on the softer belly, chest, and facial hair. Using your fingers, gently pluck any long or light-colored hairs from the ears until they look velvety black. Bathe your Deerhound as needed to remove any dust, dirt, or doggy odor that"s developed. A bath will temporarily make his coat feel soft, but it will regain its crisp feel in a few days. With regular brushing, he really shouldn"t need a bath more than a couple of times a year unless you"re showing him. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Deerhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Deerhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Because your Deerhound has floppy ears, you should check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Deerhound may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Begin accustoming your Deerhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult — essential with a dog this size. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Deerhounds can get along with children, but they"re not really a playmate kind of dog, being more into body slams than playing fetch. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Deerhounds aren"t best pleased by the poking, prodding, and pulling of toddlers and will generally stalk off rather than put up with it. Their size also makes them unsuited to life with small children; they can easily knock them over without meaning to. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. While your Deerhound may learn to live peaceably with small dogs or cats indoors, if he sees them running around outdoors it can be a different story.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 5 inches to 1 foot, 8 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  35 to 55 poundsLife Span:  10 to 12 years
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a medium-sized, long-haired dog who, as his name suggests, originates from Poland. Polish Lowland Sheepdog is the literal translation of his Polish name, Polski Owczarek Nizinny (pronounced poll-ski ov-cha-rik nee-shinny). In the United States and Poland, the breed is referred to simply as PON. Although PONs nearly became extinct after World War II, they made a dramatic comeback in the 1950s and — though still relatively rare in the U.S. — they are currently popular in their native Poland as companion dogs for apartment dwellers and as working farm dogs in rural areas. The PON belongs to the American Kennel Club Herding Dog Group. Not surprisingly, the PON has strong herding instincts and a loyal personality. Like other herding breeds, the PON is also an independent thinker. He is a smart, self-confident dog that thrives within a family and typically is wary of strangers. One outstanding characteristic of the PON is his uncanny memory, which makes him a quick study and relatively easy to train. However, he is strong willed and will try to dominate his owner if given the chance. The PON is an active dog who requires a good deal of exercise — don"t expect your PON to be a couch potato — but he isn"t hyperactive or nervous. This is a breed with a strong work ethic who enjoys having a job to do, especially if it means doing it for his family. Obedience training and agility classes are good outlets for the PON, providing him with both mental and physical stimulation. The PON is not a party animal: he tends to attach himself to a select few people and remains aloof with others. It"s important to socialize him from puppyhood so he becomes accustomed to many different kinds of people. Take the cute PON puppy with you to the park or on errands, and let people admire and touch him. The PON is generally good with children and other pets if he is raised with them from puppyhood. Don"t be surprised if he tries to herd the kids, though: he likes to keep his flock (human or otherwise) neatly gathered in one spot. Despite his aloof and hardworking tendencies, the PON is a naturally happy dog with a joyful personality. He also knows what he wants and how to get it. If he has his eye on something, he will typically stare at the object of desire, then glance at you, patiently waiting for you to understand. When his patience wears out, however, he can be a thief, stealing household item such as towels or tools, and stashing them away. As some PON owners say, "First they steal your heart, and then they steal your underwear!" .
The PON appreciates a good meal and would prefer to repeat the experience often every day. Don"t give in when he gives you that pathetic, hungry look. Since he won"t monitor his food intake, you have to: feed him only the amounts appropriate for his size and age, and remember that snacks and treats count. That cute, shaggy PON puppy can easily fool you into thinking he"s an amenable dog who"ll follow your every whim. Not so — the PON has a very strong personality, even as a youngster. He thinks for himself. That"s certainly a good trait for a working dog, but it also means his owner must be firm, fair, and persistent. In other words, you have to be the boss. The PON adores his family, but he"s aloof and suspicious toward strangers. Don"t expect him to greet your dinner guests with a friendly look and a wagging tail. Proper socialization is essential to encourage the PON to be comfortable with a variety of people, so get him out and about among friendly strangers from the very beginning. Puppy classes are an excellent idea. While he isn"t hyperactive, the PON does have a lot of energy and stamina. If he doesn"t get enough mental and physical stimulation, he"ll get bored (don"t we all), which can lead to excessive barking, chewing, or digging. To prevent problem behaviors, keep the PON busy with activities and don"t leave him alone for long periods of time. While the PON"s shaggy coat is adorable, let"s face it: it does require a great deal of grooming. If that"s not for you, or if you can"t delegate the job to another willing family member, consider a different breed. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog is an old breed. He is believed to be descended from the Puli, a Hungarian herding dog, as well as central Asian dogs including the Tibetan Mastiff, Tibetan Spaniel, Lhasa Apso, and Tibetan Terrier. One intriguing — and not impossible — theory is that the Huns were responsible for spreading the breed to many different countries as they plundered their way through various cultures. In 1514, a Polish merchant named Kazimierz Grabski sailed from Gdansk to Scotland with a cargo of grain to exchange for Scottish sheep. Six PONs were onboard to herd the sheep and, as the story goes, a Scottish shepherd asked for a pair of PONs in exchange for a ram. The shepherd got a deal: two female PONs and one male. It"s commonly believed that these three dogs were used to crossbreed with Scottish dogs to develop the Bearded Collie. The ongoing story of the PON is a history of survival. In the 1800s, when sheep herding declined in Poland, the number of PONs also declined. World War II, which brought terrible devastation to Poland, almost decimated the breed. Luckily, a Polish veterinarian named Dr. Danuta Hryniewics took action. She began efforts to save the breed with the help of her own PON, a male named Smok. Smok sired 10 litters of PONs in the 1950s; in 1958, the first litter with a full pedigree was born. By 1969, her Kordegardy Kennels had produced more than 140 puppies, including many champions. All PONs in existence today can be traced back to Smok and his progeny. In 1959, a breed standard was written for the PON and accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. Not surprisingly, Smok was the model for this standard. In 1979, a U.S. Bearded Collie breeder named Moira Morrison learned of the PON ancestry in her breed. Intrigued, she imported two PONs from Poland — the first known to have come to the U.S. Four years later, Kaz and Betty Augustowski, both of Polish heritage, saw an advertisement in a dog magazine and acquired their first PON. Over the next 18 years, they became passionately involved in getting the breed recognized by the American Kennel Club. Their efforts were rewarded when PONs gained entry into the Miscellaneous class on July 1, 1999, The AKC granted the breed full recognition on August 1, 2001. Although the PON is still rare in America, today it is the most popular of all the native breeds in its home country and is unofficially considered Poland"s national dog.
Males and females stand 17 to 20 inches tall and weigh 35 to 55 pounds.
The PON is a highly intelligent, hardworking dog. He is known for his ability to remember what he learns — both good and bad habits. He is strong willed and can be stubborn, so he needs an owner who will kindly and consistently provide leadership. Otherwise, he will try to rule the roost. Because of his working heritage, the PON likes to be busy, physically and mentally. He needs activities to challenge him: hiking, herding, agility, tracking, and advanced obedience training are all good bets. If he isn"t provided proper outlets for his energy, he is likely to express himself through more annoying amusements such as barking, digging, and chewing. The PON doesn"t make friends with just anyone. He is most comfortable with his family and is suspicious of people he doesn"t know.
PONs are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Canine hip dysplasia is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is actually a family of eye diseases involving the gradual deterioration of the retina. In the early stages of the disease, dogs become night blind; eventually they lose their daytime vision as well.
The Polish Lowland Sheepdog prefers a cooler climate, but he can adapt to warmer temperatures as long as he has adequate, cool shelter. Although the PON is ideally suited for rural life, he does well in apartments and houses without backyards as long as he has a job to do and is taken outside frequently for exercise. If he isn"t herding a flock on a farm, he appreciates the challenge of obedience, agility, or herding competitions, or even just hiking and jogging with you.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. The PON benefits from two meals a day rather than one — and don"t leave food out for him all the time. He"s known for his hearty appetite and will overeat if he can. If you"re unsure whether there"s too much fat under all that fur (it"s hard to tell by simply looking), give him the hands-on test by placing your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel (but not see) his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your PON, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The shaggy PON has a long, dense topcoat and a soft, thick undercoat. The coat comes in many colors; the most common are white with black, gray, or sandy patches; or gray with white or chocolate. Occasionally, a PON is all white, all black, or black and tan. Most PONs are born with a darker puppy coat than they will have as adults, with the exception of puppies born white. The PON is considered a nonshedding breed. When it comes to grooming the PON, the natural look is in. That doesn"t mean the breed doesn"t need grooming — in fact, that shaggy coat needs a lot of grooming to keep it free of tangles, though no trimming is necessary or even recommended. Breed enthusiasts stress the importance of not primping the PON. Plan on brushing and combing thoroughly at least twice a week, and always before bathing (detangling spray is helpful). A bath every two months may be necessary. Like all dogs with fluffy coats, the PON gets dirty easily, so you"re in for muddy paws, leaves or burrs tracked into the house, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet and dirty beard. Trim your PON"s nails once a month, and check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Wipe them out weekly (and after bathing or any other time the PON gets wet) with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. The PON coat can be too much for an inexperienced owner to handle, so you consider having a professional groomer help with the upkeep. That won"t let you completely off the hook, though. You"ll still need to brush that coat thoroughly between professional grooming sessions. If you aren"t crazy about combing and brushing — no doubt about it, it"s a lot of work — you may want to consider another breed.
Your PON will be your devoted, lifelong friend. His loyal nature makes him a loving companion for an individual or family — he"ll consider the family his flock. He gets along with children and other animals best if he"s raised with them. Because he is naturally wary of outsiders (a good trait for a herding/guard dog), the PON is most likely to accept as part of his flock those he knows from puppyhood. He is likely to remain aloof with those he doesn"t know, though he can warm up to family friends and pets with exposure and positive interaction.

Although the Pomeranian (also called Zwergspitz, Dwarf Spitz, Loulou, or, affectionately Pom) only weighs from three to seven pounds, this lively little dog has a personality the size of Texas!The Pomeranian is the smallest member of the Spitz family of dogs, which includes the Samoyed, Alaskan Malamute, and Norwegian Elkhound, among others.Poms take their name from the province of Pomerania, in Germany. They became especially popular when Queen Victoria allowed some of her Pomeranians to be shown in a conformation show, the first Pomeranians ever to be shown.Cute, feisty and furry, Poms are intelligent and loyal to their families. Don"t let their cuteness fool you, however. These independent, bold dogs have minds of their own. They are alert and curious about the world around them. Unfortunately, in their minds, they are much larger than they really are, which can sometimes lead them to harass and even attack much larger dogs.Luckily, if they are properly socialized with other dogs and animals, they generally get along quite well with them.Pomeranians have a wedge-shaped head with erect ears. Some people describe their faces as fox-like, while others think that "baby-doll" or "pansy" is a better description.Their dark, almond-shaped eyes sparkle with intelligence and curiosity. Their noses can be dark or the same color as their coats. Their distinctive plumed tail fans out over their back.Pomeranians come in a wide variety of solid colors, with red, orange, white or cream, blue, brown, or black being the most common. Rarely, you might see a white Pom with colored markings (called parti-colored), or a black and tan one, or even an orange and sable one. The Pom"s profuse double coat stands out from his body, and he has a luxurious ruff around his neck and chest. The coats looks as though it would be difficult to care for, but in reality, regular brushing is typically all it needs.Despite their small size, Pomeranians have a loud bark and make excellent watchdogs. They sometimes don"t know when to stop barking, however, so it"s a good idea to train them to stop barking on command.Pomeranians make excellent pets for older people and those who are busy, because they aren"t an overly dependent breed. They are also good for apartment dwellers or homes that don"t have a backyard. Because of their small size, they aren"t recommended for families with small children who might injure them accidentally.Poms generally are good at learning tricks, but you must be consistent and firm when training them. If you don"t establish yourself as top dog in your household, your Pom will be more than glad to take over and may even become snappish.Poms have a lot of energy and enjoy going for walks. They trot along, proudly holding their head up, meeting new people and exploring new sights and smells.More and more Poms are being trained in obedience, agility, tracking and flyball. Some also have been trained as hearing assistance dogs. They make excellent therapy dogs and bring delight and comfort to the sick and elderly in hospitals and nursing homes. If you"d like a pint-size companion with personality plus, the Pomeranian may be the choice for you.
Pomeranians often are suspicious of strangers and can bark a lot. Pomeranians can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. High heat and humidity can cause your Pom to become overheated and possibly have heat stroke. When your Pom is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately. They definitely are housedogs and should not be kept outdoors. While Poms are good with children, they are not a good choice for very young or highly active children because of their small size. Never let your small children and your Pom play without supervision. Because they are so small, Poms can be perceived as prey by owls, eagles, hawks, coyotes, and other wild animals. Never leave them outside unattended, and be watchful if there are predatory birds in your location. If this is the case, stay close to your Pom to discourage birds from trying to carry them off! Because they are small and attractive, Poms are targets for dognappers, another reason why you shouldn"t leave them outside unattended, even in a fenced yard. Although they are small, Poms don"t seem to realize it and can have a "big dog" attitude. This can spell disaster if they decide to chase a bigger dog that they think is encroaching upon their territory, or if they jump from a high place. It"s up to you to make sure that your little one doesn"t harm himself due to not realizing his limitations. When your Pom gets old, he may develop bald spots in his beautiful coat. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Pomeranians were developed in the province of Pomerania from the ancient Spitz breeds of the far northern countries. The closest relatives of the Pomeranian are the Norwegian Elkhound, the Schipperke, the German Spitz, the American Eskimo Dog, the Samoyed, and other members of the Spitz, or Northern, group of dogs, all of which are characterized by their wedge-shaped heads, prick ears, and thick furry coats. Early Pomeranians weighed as much as 30 pounds.Even in the early days of the breed, Poms were popular. Notable people who were said to have Pomeranian-type dogs include theologian Martin Luther, who had a Pom named Belferlein that he mentioned often in his writings; artist Michelangelo, whose Pom sat on a satin pillow and watched him paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; physicist Isaac Newton, whose Pom named Diamond reportedly chewed many of his manuscripts, and composer Mozart, whose Pom was named Pimperl and to whom he dedicated an aria.In 1761, the appeal of Pomeranians moved to England when Sophie Charlotte, a 17-year-old Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (a neighboring province of Pomerania) married the English prince who was to become King George III. She brought with her a pair of mostly white dogs named Phebe and Mercury that weighed more than 20 pounds, which was standard at that time. Although they were popular in royal circles, the new breed didn"t catch on with the public.All of that changed during the reign of Queen Charlotte"s granddaughter, Queen Victoria. During her 64 years as the Queen of England, Queen Victoria bred more than 15 different breeds of dogs. In her later years, she was especially fond of Pomeranians, which she first saw in 1888 during a trip to Italy. She fell in love with a sable and red Pom named Marco who weighed only 12 pounds. Today, many believe that he was the inspiration to breed smaller Pomeranians.Marco went on to compete under the Queen"s name in many dog shows and won many honors. Victoria also bought three other Poms on the same trip to Florence in 1888. After Marco, Victoria"s next most famous Pom was a female named Gina who also became a champion at London dog shows. Victoria loved her Poms so much that as she lay dying, she asked that her favorite Pom (named Turi) be brought to her bedside.Victoria"s love of the Pomeranians, especially the smaller ones, inspired English dog fanciers to begin breeding even smaller Poms. From 1900 until the 1930s, Pomeranians often had the largest number of entries at Crufts dog show, Britain"s national championship. It was during this time that the breed standard was stabilized, with the size coming down to its present weight and the coat developing its characteristic deep frilling. Also during this time, a wider range of colors became available. Early Poms were primarily white, black, chocolate or blue, but after an orange dog began winning at dog shows in the 1920s, the range of colors expanded.The popularity of the Pom spread across the Atlantic. In 1888, a Pomeranian named Dick was the first Pom entered into the American Kennel Club (AKC) stud book. In 1892, the first Pom was entered in a dog show in New York. After the AKC recognized the breed in 1900, Pomeranians quickly grew in popularity in the United States. In 1909, the American Pomeranian Club was accepted as a member club of the AKC and designated as the Parent Club for the breed. By mid-century, Poms were one of the most popular dog breeds in America. Today they rank 14th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Pomeranians are 7 to 12 inches tall and weigh 3 to 7 pounds. Some litters have puppies that are throwbacks to the days when they were larger and grow to be 12 to 14 pounds or more. These puppies can be an excellent choice for families with children.
The extroverted Pomeranian is smart and vivacious. He loves meeting new people and gets along well with other animals, although he sometimes thinks he"s a lot bigger than he is. Don"t let him challenge bigger dogs in his mistaken belief that he"s their size or larger.Alert and inquisitive, Pomeranians make excellent watchdogs and will bark at anything out of the ordinary. Teach them to stop barking on command, though, or they might go on all day long.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy who"s willing to sit nicely on your lap, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Aggression and shyness aren"t characteristics that your Pom puppy will outgrow.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. They should be friendly, calm, quiet, and easy to live with.Like every dog, Pomeranians need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pom puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pomeranians are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poms will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poms, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Allergies: Some Pomeranians can suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. If your Pomeranian is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect that he has an allergy and have him checked by your vet. Epilepsy: Some Pomeranians develop epilepsy and have seizures. If your Pom has seizures, take him to the vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. Eye Problems: Pomeranians are prone to a variety of eye problems, including cataracts, dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) (dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva), and tear duct problems. These problems can appear in young adult dogs and may lead to blindness if untreated. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing. Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs occasionally in Pomeranians. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pomeranians usually are able to lead normal, healthy lives, unlike some of the large and giant breeds, who require surgery to get around easily. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pomeranian has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The first signs are limping and atrophy of the leg muscle. Qualified vets can perform a surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a "false joint" and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: This is a very common problem for Poms. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Collapsed Trachea: This is a condition in which the trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a "goose honk." Since it can be caused by pulling too hard against a collar while walking, you should train your Pom to walk nicely beside you instead of pulling at the leash, or use a harness instead of a collar. Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically. Dental Problems: Poms are prone to teeth and gum problems and early tooth loss. Watch for dental problems and take your Pom to the vet for regular dental exams.
Pomeranians are very active indoors and are good choices for apartment dwellers and people without a fenced yard. They have a moderate activity level and will enjoy several short daily walks or play times.They are remarkably hearty and enjoy longer walks, but always keep in mind that they are small and sensitive to heat. They love to play and can get bored easily, so be sure to give them lots of toys and rotate them frequently so there"s always something new. They especially enjoy toys that challenge them.One activity that both you and your Pom will enjoy is trick training. Poms love to learn new things and enjoy being the center of attention, so teaching them tricks is a perfect way to bond with them while providing them with exercise and mental stimulation.They have a short attention span, so keep training sessions brief and fun. Reward your Pom with praise, treats, or play whenever he correctly performs a command or does something else you like.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Pom, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Pomeranian"s glory is his thick, stand-out, double coat with an undercoat of soft, thick, fluffy hair and a top coat of long, straight, shiny hair that"s harsh to the touch. The longer hair around the neck and chest forms a frill, enhancing the Pom"s proud appearance.The Pom"s tail is another outstanding characteristic of the breed. The plumed tail with its profusion of hair lies flat, fanning out upon the dog"s back. Interestingly, when Poms are born, their tails don"t look like this. It may take months for the tail to develop this way.One of the great things about Pomeranians is that they come in any color or pattern you can imagine in dogs, including black, black and tan, blue, blue and tan, chocolate, chocolate and tan, cream, cream sable, orange, orange sable, red, red sable, sable (black-tipped hairs on a background of silver, gold, gray, fawn, or brown), brindle (a base color of gold, red, or orange with strong black cross stripes), and white. Poms that are white with patches of any other color are called "parti-colored."Poms are considered to shed moderately. Males typically shed their undercoats once a year. Unspayed females often shed their undercoats when they are in season, after they deliver a litter, and whenever they"re stressed.To keep hair off your clothes and furniture, brush and comb your Pom at least twice weekly with a wire slicker brush and metal comb. This distributes the skin"s natural oils, keeps the coat and skin healthy, and prevent mats or tangles. Be sure you brush and comb all the way down to the skin to remove all the shedding undercoat.Start brushing your Pom at his head, and then part the coat and brush it forward so it falls back in place when you are finished. If you want, you can trim your Pom occasionally for neatness, especially on the feet, around the face and ears, and around the rear end.You can bathe him as often as you like, whether that"s daily or monthly, as long as you use a mild dog shampoo and conditioner. If he starts to smell a little doggy between baths, sprinkle some baby powder on his coat, let it sit a few minutes, and then brush it out.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Poms are prone to dental problems, so this is something that you must be especially watchful for. It"s a good idea to brush their teeth at least once a week, and even better, daily.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Pom enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Pomeranian to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The bold and active Pomeranian loves to play, but he"s best suited to a home with older children who can be trusted to handle him carefully. Many breeders refuse to sell puppies to homes with very young children, for good reason. Sturdy though he is, the diminutive Pom is all too easily injured if he"s accidentally dropped or stepped on by a clumsy child.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pomeranians can get along great with cats and other animals, especially if they"re raised with them. Protect them from bigger dogs. Poms don"t realize just how small they are, and they have no fear of challenging bigger dogs.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 1 inch to 1 foot, 4 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  Starts at 20 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The small, active Shetland Sheepdog (nicknamed the Sheltie) was once a Scottish farmer"s best friend: sounding the alarm when anyone approached the property, barking at birds and other animals to shoo them from the garden, and later, with crosses to Scottish herding dogs, keeping the sheep flocks in line. While at first glance they look like a smaller version of the Rough Collie, the two are distinctly different breeds. Shelties are loving companions for all members of the family, including the kids, but they can be reserved or even shy around strangers. Because of their protective nature, they"re quick to bark if they sense that anything"s amiss in their territory. Training is essential to keep this trait from becoming a nuisance. On the upside, they make excellent watchdogs. You just have to teach them some discrimination. Ask any Sheltie owner, and they"ll probably tell you how smart their dog is. According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an animal intelligence expert, that"s more than pride of ownership talking. In his studies of the intelligence of 132 different dog breeds, Shelties ranked sixth in intelligence by being able to understand a new command after being told it fewer than five times on average, and obeying commands the first time they were given at least 95 percent of the time. Because of their intelligence, willingness to please, and athletic ability, Shelties excel at performance events. In their size group, Shelties typically dominate the field in agility. They"re also exceptionally good in competitive obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding. In fact, Shelties have a reputation for being a little too smart for their own good. This is a breed that needs a job. Without plenty of mental stimulation, Shelties quickly become bored and will invent their own entertainment, which may or may not be to their people"s liking. Shelties retain a strong herding instinct. You"ll find that your Sheltie will enthusiastically chase and try to "herd" squirrels, rabbits, and children, running around them, barking, and nipping. Shelty owners should discourage this habit, especially with children, because it can lead to biting. Never let your Sheltie herd unless it"s in a herding class with appropriate subjects such as ducks or sheep. Shelties are relatively inactive indoors and can handle apartment living if they"re walked daily and aren"t recreational barkers. Otherwise, they need a fenced yard where they can play safely and be prevented from seeking out animals, people, or cars to "herd." Shelties have a long, dense, furry coat and shed heavily. Lots of people don"t realize just how much loose fur they"re letting themselves in for, and many Shelties are given up to rescue groups every year because they shed. Be sure that you and your vacuum cleaner can handle that much hair. Shelties can be a good choice for a working person as they"ll stay home alone contentedly, provided they get their fair share of attention when their people are home. They thrive in an environment where they"re given companionship, playtime, training, and quiet patting. Your love they"ll return tenfold.
Many Shelties are very vocal, and they have a loud, piercing bark. To keep your relations with neighbors friendly, it"s important to train your Sheltie at an early age to stop barking on command. Expect your Sheltie to shed profusely in the spring, and sometimes at other times in the year. Shelties are extremely intelligent and like to have a job to do. They can be stubborn, however. Make training fun and allow them time to make up their own minds to do what you want them to do. Shelties have a lot of energy and need to be able to run. They thrive on activities such as agility and flyball, where they get both mental and physical exercise. Shelties have been popular family dogs for many years. Because there"s a big demand for puppies, there are many poorly bred Shelties for sale. If you"re looking for a puppy, make sure you find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees.
The Sheltie hails from the rugged Shetland Islands, which lie between Scotland and Norway, about 50 miles north of Scotland and a bit south of the Arctic Circle. These islands are also home to other small breeds of animals, such as Shetland Ponies and Shetland Sheep. For many years, the Shetland Sheepdog was called the Toonie, taken from the Norwegian word for farm. Farmers bred the dogs, crossing the Border Collie with smaller dogs, to herd and protect their flocks of Shetland Sheep. Some speculate that one of the tasks of Shetland Sheepdogs was to protect the small sheep from birds. Indeed, many of today"s Shelties seem to have a passion for chasing birds, and some even try to chase airplanes and helicopters flying overhead. In the early 1800s, the Sheltie was brought to England and Scotland, where he was described as a miniature Collie. On the Shetland Islands, the farmers started breeding their small Shelties to be even smaller and fluffier, so they could sell them to visitors to the islands. It"s rumored that a Prince Charles Spaniel (a variety of English Toy Spaniel) and some Pomeranian dogs, left on the island by tourists, were crossed with the native sheepdogs. There was so much crossbreeding that by the end of the 19th century, islanders realized that the original type of dog was disappearing. There was much dissension about what the original dog had looked like, however, and how to get back to it. Some breeders believed they needed to crossbreed with Collies in order to regain the original type, some felt that they should breed only the existing Shelties who were closest to the original type, and others continued to crossbreed indiscriminately with other breeds to develop small, pretty pets. Shelties of all three types were entered in dog shows in the early 20th century, up to World War I. In 1909, England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed. Altogether, 28 Shelties were registered that year as Shetland Collies (rough). Four of them still appear in the pedigrees of many modern champion Shelties: two males named Lerwick Tim and Trim and two females named Inverness Topsy and Inga. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was Lord Scott in 1911. Collie breeders in England were unhappy about the name of the breed, however, and protested to the Kennel Club. This led to the change of the name to Shetland Sheepdog. The Shetland Sheepdog stirred up controversy both in Great Britain and the United States for many years, with rumors of crossbreeding and long-running disagreements about what the breed should look like. As a consequence, many Shetland Sheepdog clubs were formed to support the different viewpoints. Finally, in 1930 the Scottish and English Clubs got together and agreed that the dog "should resemble a collie (rough) in miniature." U.S. breeders imported Shelties from England until the 1950"s, but by that time, American and British Shelties had begun to diverge greatly in type and size. Today, almost all Shetland Sheepdogs in the U.S. are descended from dogs that were imported from England between World Wars I and II. As the breed became more well known, its numbers increased in the U.S. In the 1970s, their popularity exploded and Shelties appeared on the American Kennel Club"s list of the ten most popular dogs in 12 of the next 15 years, peaking in the early 1990s. Today the Sheltie ranks 20th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club. And how is the Sheltie faring in his native Shetland Islands? Ironically, he"s fairly rare in his rugged homeland — the breed has been replaced by the Border Collie.
The Shetland Sheepdog stands between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder, but it"s not unusual for them to be over- or undersize. A typical Sheltie weighs about 22 pounds, but a large one can weigh as much as 35 or 40 pounds.
The Sheltie is intensely loyal, gentle, and sensitive. There"s a wide range of personalities in the breed, from outgoing and boisterous to calm and sedate to shy or retiring. It"s normal for Shelties to be reserved with strangers, but steer clear of dogs that seem overly timid or nervous. If you"re choosing a puppy, it"s fine if they don"t always come right up to a stranger, but they should be happily curious and ready to make friends with someone who sits down on the floor with them. Whatever their personality, Shelties prefer to be with their people at all times and will follow them from room to room during the course of the day. Like all dogs, Shelties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sheltie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Shelties are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shelties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Shelties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, thyroid, and von Willebrand"s disease and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can"t maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy"s grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder"s lines. Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and can be diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Usually both eyes are affected, but not necessarily to the same degree. Those dogs with minor anomaly make fine pets and usually do not lose their eyesight. Those that are more severely affected may lose their eyesight within a few years of diagnosis. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around x1050_300x600_300x250_a"data-id="pb_prebidjs_300x1050_300x600_300x250_a"data-offset="0"class="gpt-ad">

Although today"s Poodles seem to epitomize a life of leisure and luxury, make no mistake: These are real dogs bred to do real jobs. Although it hardly seems possible when you look at a primped-up Poodle in the show ring, the breed was originally a water retriever, a job that requires jumping in the water to fetch waterfowl for hunters. In fact, the English name poodle is derived from the German word pudel, or pudelin, which means to splash in the water. And in France, Poodles are called Caniche, a name derived from chien canard, meaning duck dog. Even the elaborate coat styling that the breed"s known for once had a practical purpose: trimmed areas lightened the weight of the dog"s coat and wouldn"t snag on underwater debris, while long hair around the joints and vital organs protected the dog from the cold water. There are three sizes of Poodle, all considered part of the same breed: going from smallest to largest, these are the Toy, the Miniature, and the Standard. The Standard is probably the oldest of the three varieties, and some still carry on the Poodle tradition of working as a water retriever. No matter the size, Poodles are renowned for a playful but dignified personality and keen intelligence. When it comes to training, this is an "A" student, and the Poodle excels at performance sports such as obedience, agility, and hunt tests. Despite his regal air, the Poodle is no snob. These are people-friendly dogs who want to stay close to their families — they get lonely when left by themselves for long periods — and are always up for a good game.
If you spoil your Poodle and don"t train him, he"s likely to conclude that he"s the alpha dog of the family. This is especially common among the smaller varieties — Miniature and Toy Poodles — who are more likely to be coddled and untrained. Teach your dog good canine manners, and then insist that he use them; it shows him that you"re the leader of the pack. Because of their intelligence and playful nature, obedience training is essential to keep your Poodle"s mind active. A Poodle who is thinking and learning isn"t bored, and therefore won"t find destructive ways to occupy himself. The Poodle coat needs a lot of upkeep to stay beautiful and healthy. Most Poodle owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every three to six weeks. If you want to save money on grooming expenses, you can learn to do it yourself, but it takes time and effort. Poodles have weepy eyes that can stain the surrounding hair. To cut down on stains, gently wipe down the face daily with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dipped in warm water. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Poodle is one of the oldest breeds developed especially for hunting waterfowl. Most historians agree that the Poodle originated in Germany, but developed into his own distinct breed in France. Many believe that the breed is the result of crosses between several European water dogs, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Hungarian, and Russian water dogs. Other historians think that one of the Poodle"s ancestors is the North African Barbet, which was imported to the Iberian Peninsula. After that, the breed arrived in Gaul where it was used for his hunting abilities. It"s also commonly believed that Poodles descended from Asian herding dogs, and then traveled with the Germanic Goth and Ostrogoth tribes to eventually become a German water dog. Yet another theory is that the Poodle descended from dogs that were brought out of the Asian steppes by the conquering North African Berbers and eventually found his way into Portugal in the 8th Century with the Moors. Whatever its ancestry, this is a very old breed. Illustrations of Poodle-like dogs adorn Egyptian and Roman artifacts and tombs dating from the first centuries B.C. The drawings and statues show dogs that look very much like modern-day Poodles, bringing in game nets, herding animals, and retrieving game from marshes. Although some say that the Miniature and Toy Poodles emerged shortly after the Standard, many believe it wasn"t until the 1400s that breeders began producing smaller versions of the Poodle — first the Miniature, then the Toy — to delight the Parisian bourgeoise. The Toy and Miniature varieties were created by breeding small Poodles to each other, not by breeding Poodles to smaller breeds. The French used the larger Standard Poodle for duck hunting, and the mid-sized Miniature Poodle to sniff out truffles in the woods. The tiny Toy Poodle"s main job, on the other hand, was to serve as a companion to the nobility and wealthy merchant class. Well-to-do owners in the Renaissance often carried their Toy Poodles in their large shirtsleeves, leading to the nickname "sleeve dogs." Gypsies and traveling performers learned that Poodles excelled in another canine profession: circus dog. They trained Poodles to perform tricks, dressing them in costumes and sculpting their coats into fanciful shapes to add to their stage appeal. Wealthy patrons took note and started clipping, decorating, and even dying their own Poodle companions. The Kennel Club in England registered their first Poodle in 1874, with the first British club for Poodle fanciers arriving on the scene two years later. It"s not known for sure when Poodles arrived in the U.S., but the American Kennel Club registered their first Poodle in 1886. The Poodle Club of America was founded in 1896, but disbanded shortly thereafter. Poodle enthusiasts reestablished the club in 1931. Poodles were fairly rare in the U.S. until after World War II. By the mid-1950s, however, the Poodle had become the most popular breed in the country, a position he held for more than 20 years.
There are three sizes of Poodle: toy, miniature, and standard. These aren"t different breeds, just different sizes of the same dog. The Toy Poodle stands up to 10 inches tall, and weighs about six to nine pounds. The Miniature Poodle stands 11 to 15 inches tall and weighs 15 to 17 pounds. The Standard Poodle stands 15 inches and taller (usually 22 inches); males weigh 45 to 70 pounds and females weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
Intelligent, loving, loyal, and mischievous are four words Poodle enthusiasts commonly use to describe the breed"s personality. The Poodle is also known for what his fans call "an air of distinction": a dignified attitude that"s hard to describe, but easy to spot in the dog. Despite his regal appearance, the Poodle has a goofy streak and loves to play — he"s always up for a game of any kind. He"s also very fond of people and eager to please. Combine that with his legendary intelligence, and you"ve got a dog that"s highly trainable. A good Poodle who"s been taught canine manners has a calm disposition, especially if he gets regular exercise to burn off his natural energy. Some owners and breeders think the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles are a bit more high-strung than the Standard; however, other breeders and owners disagree with this theory. The Poodle is protective of his home and family, and if strangers approach your house, he"ll sound a warning bark to let you know. And although he"s affectionate with his family, he may take a while to warm up to new people. An outstanding trait of the Poodle is his intelligence. He is often said to have human-like intelligence, an amazing cleverness that astounds his owners. Of course, smart dogs can be difficult to live with. They learn fast — good habits and bad — and they remember everything.
Poodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison"s disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Poodles, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol resulting from other conditions. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Poodle exhibits these two symptoms, take it to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease, including surgery and medication. Epilepsy: A common cause of seizures in all varieties of Poodles is idiopathic epilepsy. It often is inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Poodle has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup. Hip Dysplasia: When the hip socket is poorly formed or the ligaments are loose enough to allow the ball of the thigh bone (femur) to slide part of the way out of the hip socket, it"s called dysplastic. Canine hip dysplasia is inherited, with environmental factors sometimes playing a large part in its development. Over time, there is degeneration of the joint that can cause arthritis and pain, even lameness. Excess weight, excessive or prolonged exercise before maturity, a fast growth rate, and high-calorie or supplemented diets can contribute to the development of canine hip dysplasia. Veterinary care includes nutritional supplements, medication and, in some cases, surgery. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by is an under active thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma and other skin conditions. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Poodle has Legg-perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose sight during the day. Many affected dogs adapt to their limited or loss of vision very well, as long as the surroundings remain the same. Optic Nerve Hypoplasia: This condition is a congenital failure if development of the optic nerve. It causes blindness and abnormal pupil response in the affected eye. Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): SA is a serious problem in Poodles, especially Standards. It"s estimated that 50 percent of all Standard Poodles are carriers, or affected. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that aids in preventing drying of the skin. It"s usually first noticed when the dog is from 1 to 5 years old. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.
Poodles do just fine in any type of home, from apartments to estates, so long as they have regular exercise and plenty of human companionship. They prefer to live indoors with the family, particularly the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles, since they have no trouble getting their ya-yas out in the house.   This intelligent breed learns quickly, but owners should be careful: It"s as easy to accidentally teach your Poodle bad habits as it is to teach him good ones, so if you"re new to dogs, sign up for an obedience class with a skilled trainer. That goes for Toy and Miniature Poodles as well. Many owners of small dogs skip training, and wind up with a badly behaved dog.
Recommended daily amount: Standards, 1.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; Miniatures, 3/4 to 1 cup; Toys, 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Like any breed, the poodle will pack on weight if he"s overfed, which can cause joint problems and other health woes. Limit treats, keep him active, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Although many owners of Miniature or Toy Poodles in particular give their dogs table scraps, resist those pleading eyes — you"ll create a finicky eater. He"ll turn up his nose at dog food, which is healthier for him. Keep your Poodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Poodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Poodle is a non-shedding breed, and a good choice for people with allergies. Many allergic people are able to keep a Poodle with no reaction. The coat comes in many colors, including blue, black, white, gray, silver, brown, café-au-lait, apricot, and cream. The hair is curly, wiry, and dense, and this unique texture can be trimmed, clipped, groomed, shaved, and otherwise manipulated into all kinds of fanciful shapes. If your dog is going to compete in the show ring, however, you can"t go too wild with the styling; the American Kennel Club allows four specific clip styles for Poodles in conformation competitions. Grooming a Poodle isn"t for the faint of heart. Poodles are high-maintenance dogs. He requires regular grooming, every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat in good condition. If you are considering a Poodle, consider the upkeep of the coat and expense of grooming. Don"t be scared, though. There are many ways to style the coat for easier care. In fact, many owners simply shave it off. That said, easy care doesn"t mean without care. Even when clipped short, your Poodle will need to be brushed, bathed, and trimmed every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat clean, short, and tangle free. Most owners pay a professional groomer, but if you"re dedicated and have the time, you can learn to groom your Poodle yourself. You"ll need a good set of electric clippers and blades, a quality pair of scissors, brush, comb, toenail trimmer, and a good how-to grooming book or video — there are many on the market just for Poodle owners. Even if you let a professional handle the complicated stuff, your Poodle needs daily brushing. Because Poodles don"t shed like other breeds, loose hair collects in the coats, and unless it"s brushed out daily, the hair will mat very quickly. Many Poodles have weepy eyes that stain the hair under their eyes. The lighter your dog"s coat, the more noticeable the tearstains. To cut down on staining, wipe around the eyes and face every day with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dampened with warm water. Be sure to check your Poodle"s ears often every week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Breeds with drop-down ears are prone to ear infections because the ear canal stays dark and moist. Also, hair grows in the Poodle"s ear canal. Sometimes, this hair needs to be plucked. Ask your groomer or veterinarian if it"s necessary for your dog. Brush your Poodle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Poodle enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Poodle to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Poodle is a wonderful companion for kids, although young kids who don"t know how to handle a dog could accidentally hurt a Toy Poodle, the smallest and most delicate variety of the breed. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Poodles who grow up with other dogs or pets in the house — or who have plenty of opportunities to interact with them in group training classes, dog parks, and the like — will enjoy their company. If your Poodle is used to being the only pet in the household, however, he may need some time and special training to help him accept a newcomer.

Portuguese fishermen ranged from the Atlantic coast of their own country to the frigid fishing grounds of Newfoundland in their quest for cod. Assisting them were medium-size, curly-coated dogs who drove fish into nets, retrieved lost tackle, and swam messages from boat to boat. Known variously as the Cao de Agua (dog of the water) and Portuguese fishing dog, these canine helpmeets developed into what we know today as the Portuguese Water Dog, a calm, intelligent, and — of course — water-loving breed. In fact, one of their distinctive characteristics is their webbed feet. Porties, as they"re nicknamed, are fun-loving and friendly. For an active family, especially one with a swimming pool, nearby beach, or boat, they can be an excellent choice. They thrive with training and are well suited to dog sports such as agility, obedience, rally, therapy work, tracking, and water work. No matter what activity you choose, make sure your Portie gets daily exercise — without it they can become frustrated and destructive. Swimming is a natural choice, but they also make great walking or jogging buddies. Like his relative the Poodle, the Portie has a reputation for being hypoallergenic. It"s not quite true — there"s really no such thing as a hypoallergenic dog. All dogs shed and produce dander to some degree. But the Portie doesn"t shed much. (Because the amount of shedding and dander varies from dog to dog — even in the same breed — the best way to know if you"ll have an allergic reaction to a particular dog is to spend time with him.) With training, there"s very little the Portie can"t do. He"s adaptable to many living situations — with enough exercise he can be an apartment dog — and tends to be quiet around the home. Affectionate and loyal, fun-loving and hard working, the Portuguese Water Dog can be a treasured friend to the right person.
Portuguese Water Dogs are energetic and need 30 minutes to an hour of vigorous exercise daily. They love swimming and make excellent jogging companions. Without proper exercise and mental stimulation, Portuguese Water Dogs can become destructive. They especially like to chew. Portuguese Water Dogs are highly intelligent. They love learning new things, but they can also become bored easily, so make training challenging and fun. Portuguese Water Dogs get along well with children and other family pets, especially if they"re raised with them. They can be reserved toward strangers, but are never lacking in love and affection for their families. Portuguese Water Dogs don"t shed much and are often considered hypoallergenic. Keep in mind that all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree, and no dog is completely hypoallergenic. If you have pet allergies, the best way to see if you"ll have a reaction to a particular dog is to spend time with him and watch for symptoms. Portuguese Water Dogs love people and should live in the home with their family. They can adapt to apartment life if they get enough exercise. Portuguese Water Dogs tend to mature more slowly than other breeds. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Portuguese Water Dog descends from dogs used for centuries by Portuguese fishermen to drive fish into nets, retrieve gear from the water, and swim messages from boat to boat. It"s likely he shares an ancestor with the Poodle, who was bred in Germany to be a water retriever. Known in his homeland as the Cao de Agua (dog of the water), the Portie served as a fishing crew member for trips ranging from off the coast of Portugal to Newfoundland. These hard-working fisherdogs almost disappeared in the early 20th century as fishing became more modernized, but a wealthy Portuguese dog lover, Vasco Bensuade, stepped in to save the breed. Fans formed a breed club and wrote a breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look and act — and Porties began to appear at dog shows. A couple of decades later they made their way to England and the United States. The Portuguese Water Dog Club of America formed in 1972, despite the fact that there were only 12 known Porties in the U.S. Just 10 years later, their numbers had increased to 650, and the American Kennel Club (AKC) admitted the dogs to its Miscellaneous Class — sort of a way station for breeds awaiting full recognition. In 1983, the AKC recognized the Portie as a distinct breed. Today, the Portuguese Water Dog ranks 69th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Male Portuguese Water Dogs stand 20 to 23 inches at the shoulder, and weigh 42 to 60 pounds. Females stand 17 to 21 inches, and weigh 35 to 50 pounds.
The Portuguese Water Dog has a lot of great qualities: he"s tireless, and fun loving, with a great sense of humor. He"s also smart enough that he can out think you if you don"t stay a step ahead of him. You may frequently find yourself laughing as he plays the clown to get your attention. You"ll find a range of temperaments in Portuguese Water Dogs. Some are strong-willed, some are laid back, and most fall somewhere in the middle. As with all dogs, Portuguese Water Dogs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Portie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Portuguese Water Dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Porties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is an inherited disease that causes sudden death in puppies between the ages of five weeks and seven months. At this time, there is no cure and no way to determine if a puppy will be affected with the disease. The only way for breeders to prevent producing affected puppies is to avoid breeding carriers of the gene. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Storage Disease (GM1) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme and allows the buildup of toxic substances in the nerve cells. It is fatal to puppies produced by two carriers. A DNA test has been developed to determine whether dogs are normal or carriers. This has dramatically reduced the incidence of both carriers and affected puppies. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Portuguese Water Dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal, an Optigen rating for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and a DNA test for GM1 (storage disease). Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Porties are people lovers and they should live in the home, not outside. Ideally, they"ll have a fenced yard where they can play safely — although with enough exercise, they can adapt to apartment life. A Portie needs 30 minutes to an hour of exercise daily: long walks, jogging or swimming, or games of fetch. With enough exercise, he"s a quiet companion indoors. Without it, well, you may come home to find your belongings chewed to bits. Train your Portuguese Water Dog using positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Avoid endless repetition or he"ll get bored. This is a dog who learns quickly and enjoys mastering new skills. Training your Portuguese Water Dog for obedience, agility, tracking, or water work is a great way to stimulate his mind and give him the activity he enjoys. He can also make a wonderful therapy dog. If nothing else, you can teach him tricks to amaze the neighbors. Any type of training will help you build a special bond with your Portie. Give him a job to do and he"ll be thrilled. Be aware that the Portuguese Water Dog likes to chew. Provide him with plenty of chew toys, rotate them regularly so he doesn"t get bored, and teach him early what"s okay to chew and what"s not.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Portuguese Water Dog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Portie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Portuguese Water Dog has two coat types: curly and wavy. Both types are a single coat, meaning there"s no undercoat. That"s why the Portie doesn"t shed as much as some breeds and why he"s often considered to be hypoallergenic. (Although all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree — there"s no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog.) The Portie"s coat can be black, white, various shades of brown, or black or brown with white. It"s popular to give the Portie a lion clip or a retriever clip. In the lion clip, the muzzle, mid-body, and rear end are short, with a tuft at the end of the tail. In the retriever clip, the coat is clipped or trimmed all over to about an inch in length, following the outline of the body. Brush or comb your Portie two or three times a week to keep the coat tangle-free. Clip or trim the coat monthly to keep it looking neat. With any dog who spends a lot of time in the water, it"s important to give a thorough fresh-water rinse after swimming to remove chemicals, salt, and other substances that can cause coat or skin problems. Wipe out and dry the ears thoroughly as well to prevent infections. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Portie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Portie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to keep his breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better. Start grooming your Portie when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Portuguese Water Dogs make excellent family companions, especially when raised with kids. They can be rambunctious, however, which is often scary or overwhelming for young children. Always teach children how to safely approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling from either party. Porties get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re raised with them. As with all dogs, you should keep an eye on Porties around small pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters.

The Pug"s comical face, with deep wrinkles around big, dark eyes and a flat round face, can"t help but make you smile. It is believed that the Pug"s name comes from the Latin word for "fist" because his face resembles a human fist. Pugs are clowns at heart, but they carry themselves with dignity. Pugs are playful dogs, ready and able for games, but they are also lovers, and must be close to their humans. Pugs love to be the center of attention, and are heartsick if ignored. Pugs are square and thickset, usually weighing no more than 20 pounds. Their heads are large and round, with large, round eyes. They have deep and distinct wrinkles on their faces. Legend has it that the Chinese, who mastered the breeding of this dog, prized these wrinkles because they resembled good luck symbols in their language. Especially prized were dogs with wrinkles that seemed to form the letters for the word "prince" in Chinese. The moles on a Pug"s cheeks are called "beauty spots." His muzzle or mask is black, with a clearly defined "thumb mark" on the forehead and a black trace down the center of the back. His ears are smooth, black and velvety. He has a characteristic undershot jaw (the lower teeth extend slightly beyond the upper teeth) and a tightly curled tail. Personality-wise, Pugs are happy and affectionate, loyal and charming, playful and mischievous. They are very intelligent, however, they can be willful, which makes training challenging. While Pugs can be good watchdogs, they aren"t inclined to be "yappy," something your neighbors will appreciate. If trained and well-socialized, they get along well with other animals and children. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers. Due to the flat shape of the Pug"s face, he does not do well in extremely hot or cold weather, and should be kept indoors. Pugs have a short, double coat, and are known for shedding profusely. If you live with a Pug, it"s a good idea to invest in a quality vacuum cleaner!
Pugs can be stubborn and difficult to housebreak. Crate training is recommended. Pugs can"t tolerate high heat and humidity because of a short muzzle (air cools down when it passes through the noses of dogs with longer muzzles before entering the lungs). When your Pug is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating. Pugs are definitely housedogs and should not be kept outdoors. Despite their short coats, Pugs shed a lot. Pugs wheeze, snort and snore, loudly. Because their eyes are so prominent, Pugs are prone to eye injuries. Pugs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if food intake isn"t monitored carefully. Pugs need human constant human companion. If you own a Pug, expect him to follow you around in the house, sit in your lap, and want to sleep in bed with you. Pug enthusiasts are a fun-loving bunch. They love Pug get-togethers, Pug parades, and dressing up their Pugs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Pugs originated in China, dating back to the Han dynasty (B.C. 206 to A.D. 200). Some historians believe they are related to the Tibetan Mastiff. They were prized by the Emperors of China and lived in luxurious accommodations, sometimes even being guarded by soldiers. Pugs are one of three types of short-nosed dogs that are known to have been bred by the Chinese: the Lion dog, the Pekingese, and the Lo-sze, which was the ancient Pug. Some think that the famous "Foo Dogs" of China are representations of the ancient Pug. Evidence of Pug-like dogs has been found in ancient Tibet and Japan. In the latter 1500s and early 1600s, China began trading with European countries. Reportedly, the first Pugs brought to Europe came with the Dutch traders, who named the breed Mopshond, a name still used today. Pugs quickly became favorites of royal households throughout Europe, and even played a role in the history of many of these families. In Holland, the Pug became the official dog of the House of Orange after a Pug reportedly saved the life of William, Prince of Orange, by giving him a warning that the Spaniards were approaching in 1572. When William of Orange (later called William III) went to England in 1688 with his wife, Mary II, to take the throne from James II, they brought their Pugs with them. It is known that black pugs existed in the 1700s because the famous artist, William Hogarth, was a Pug enthusiast. He portrayed a black Pug and many others in his famous paintings. In 1785, Goya also portrayed Pugs in his paintings. As the Pug"s popularity spread throughout Europe, it was often known by different names in different countries. In France, it was called Carlin; in Spain Dogullo; in Germany Mops; and in Italy, Caganlino. Marie Antoinette had a Pug named Mops before she married Louis XVI at the age of 15. Another famous Frenchwoman, Josephine Bonaparte, had a Pug named Fortune. Before she married Napoleon Bonaparte, she was confined at Les Carmes prison. Since her beloved Pug was the only "visitor" she was allowed, she would conceal messages in his collar to take to her family. In the early 1800s, Pugs were standardized as a breed with two lines becoming dominant in England. One line was called the Morrison line and, reportedly, was founded upon the royal dogs of Queen Charlotte, wife of George III. The other line was developed by Lord and Lady Willoughby d"Eresby, and was founded on dogs imported from Russia or Hungary. Pugs were first exhibited in England in 1861. The studbook began in 1871 with 66 Pugs in the first volume. Meanwhile, in China, Pugs continued to be bred by the royal families. When the British overran the Chinese Imperial Palace in 1860, they discovered several Pugs, and brought some of the little dogs back to England with them. Two Pugs named Lamb and Moss were brought to England. These two "pure" Chinese lines were bred and produced Click. He was an outstanding dog and was bred many times to dogs of both the Willoughby and Morrison lines. Click is credited with making Pugs a better breed overall and shaping the modern Pug as we know it today. Pugs became very popular during the Victorian era and were featured in many paintings, postcards, and figurines of the period. Often, they were depicted wearing wide, decorative collars or large bows around their short, thick necks. Queen Victoria had many Pugs, and also bred them. The queen preferred apricot-fawn Pugs, whereas another Pug fancier, Lady Brassey, made black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Pugs were introduced to the United States after the Civil War, and the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. At first, Pugs were very popular, but by the turn of the century, interest in the breed waned. A few dedicated breeders kept breeding and, after some years, the breed regained popularity. Founded in 1931, the Pug Dog Club of America was also recognized by the AKC that year.
Pugs weigh between 14 and 18 pounds (male and female). Generally, they are 10 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder.
Don"t expect a Pug to hunt, guard or retrieve. Pugs were bred to be companions, and that"s exactly what they do best. The Pug craves affection — and your lap — and is very unhappy if his devotion isn"t reciprocated. He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie. This doesn"t mean the Pug is a stick-in-the-mud. Au contraire. He is a playful, comical dog that enjoys living it up, and delights his owner with silly antics. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Pug needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pug puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pugs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pugs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pugs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Cheyletiella Dermatitis (Walking Dandruff): This is a skin condition that is caused by a small mite. If you see heavy dandruff, especially down the middle of the back, contact your vet. The mites that cause this condition are contagious, which means all pets in the household need to treated. Pug Dog Encephalitis: PDE is a fatal inflammatory brain disease that is unique to Pugs. Medical researchers don"t know why Pugs develop this condition; there is no way test for it or to treat it. A diagnosis of PDE can only be made by testing the brain tissue of the dog after it dies. PDE usually affects young dogs, causing them to seizure, circle, become blind, then fall into a coma and die. This can happen in a few days or weeks. Since PDE seems to have a genetic component, the Pug Dog Club of America, along with the American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation, is sponsoring research projects to try to learn more about this devastating disease. Epilepsy: PDE isn"t the only thing that can cause Pugs to seizure. They are prone to a condition called idiopathic epilepsy: seizures for no known reason. If your Pug has seizures, take him to your vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. Nerve Degeneration: Older Pugs that drag their rear, stagger, have trouble jumping up or down, or become incontinent may be suffering from nerve degeneration. Pugs affected with this condition don"t appear to be in pain and the condition usually advances slowly. Researchers aren"t sure why it occurs. Since their front legs often remain strong, some owners buy carts to help their Pugs get around, and the veterinarian might be able to prescribe medication to help alleviate symptoms. Corneal Ulcers: Because his eyes are so large and prominent, the Pug"s eyes can be injured easily or develop ulcers on the cornea (the clear part of the eye). If your Pug squints or the eyes look red and tear excessively, contact your vet immediately. Corneal ulcers usually respond well to medication, but if left untreated, can cause blindness or even rupture the eye. Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Pugs. They can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don"t produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care. Eye Problems: Because their large eyes bulge, Pugs are prone to a variety of eye problems, including proptosis (the eyeball is dislodged from the eye socket and the eyelid clamps behind it); distichiasis (an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye); progressive retinal atrophy (a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that leads to blindness); and entropion (the eyelid, usually the lower lid, rolls inward, causing the hair on the lid to rub on the eye and irritate it). Allergies: Some Pugs suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact to food allergies. If your Pug is licking at his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect allergy and have him checked by your vet. Demodectic Mange: Also called demodicosis, all dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems. If your Pug has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, it can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly, skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. Staph Infection: Staph bacteria is commonly found on skin, but some dogs will develop pimples and infected hair follicles if their immune systems are stressed. The lesions can look like hives where there is hair; on areas without hair, the lesions can look like ringworm. You should contact your vet for appropriate treatment. Yeast Infection: If your Pug smells bad, is itchy and has blackened, thickened skin, he may have a yeast infection. It commonly affects the armpits, feet, groin, neck, and inside the ears. Your vet can prescribe medications to clear this up. Hemi-vertebrae: Short-nosed breeds, such as Pugs, Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, can have misshaped vertebrae. Sometimes, only a few of the vertebrae are affected and the dog is able to live a normal life. Others will stagger and display an uncoordinated, weak gait between 4 and 6 months of age. Some dogs get progressively worse and may even become paralyzed. The cause of the condition is unknown. Surgery can help. Hip Dysplasia: This malady affects small breeds as well as large breeds, including Pugs. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pugs are usually able to lead normal, healthy lives with proper veterinary attention. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pug has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Pugs suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your Pug carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.
Though playful and rambunctious, the Pug is a low-maintenance companion, making it ideal for older owners. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers as well. Their compact package belies a great deal of energy, so expect to be entertained with some goofy antics if your Pug doesn"t get a walk or some playtime. They are sensitive to heat and humidity, however, so if you live in a hot or humid environment, be sure your Pug doesn"t spend too much time outside. Light sleepers may also want to invest in a pair of ear plugs — Pugs are prone to snore.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. While the Pug"s first love is human attention, his second love is food. These dogs love to eat, eat, eat. This, combined with their small stature, puts them at risk for obesity. As a Pug owner, you must show great restraint. Do not indulge him with food. Feed appropriate portions, limit treats and encourage exercise. For more on feeding your Pug, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Even though the coats are short, Pugs are a double-coated breed. Pugs are typically fawn-colored or black. The fawn color can have different tints, such as apricot or silver, and all Pugs have a short, flat, black muzzle. The coat is short and smooth, but don"t be deceived. Pugs shed like crazy, especially in summer. The wise Pug owner accepts this, and adjusts her wardrobe accordingly, wearing light-colored clothing that better hides hair. Following that, regular brushing and bathing helps keep the coat in good condition and shedding to a minimum. A monthly bath is sufficient, though some owners bathe their Pugs more frequently. The Pug"s small size is handy: you can drop him right in the kitchen or utility sink for a bath. Regular nail trimming is essential, since these housedogs don"t usually wear down their nails outdoors like active breeds do. It"s a good idea to clean the Pug"s ears every few weeks, as well. What requires special attention is the Pug"s facial wrinkles. These folds are hotbeds for infection if allowed to become damp or dirty. The wrinkles must be dried thoroughly after bathing, and wiped out in-between baths. Some owners simply use a dry cotton ball; others use commercial baby wipes to wipe out the folds. Additionally, the Pug"s bulging eyes need special attention. Because they protrude, the eyes are vulnerable to injury and irritation from soaps and chemicals. Like many small breeds, the Pug can be susceptible to gum disease. Regular brushing with a small, soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste helps prevent this. Begin accustoming your Pug to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Pugs love kids. Though small, the Pug is not delicate like some toy breeds, so he is a good breed choice for families with children. However, children who want an active pet to retrieve balls or play soccer will be disappointed with a Pug. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets. Properly trained and socialized, the Pug enjoys the companionship of dogs, and can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.

Puggles are a cross breed of the Pug and Beagle. They have the wrinkles of their Pug parents and the longer muzzle, ears, and tail of a Beagle — a look that draws comparisons to miniature Mastiffs. This unique appearance and his friendly nature has driven a rapid rise in popularity since the first Puggle was bred in the 1990s. Cross breeds such as the Puggle are often referred to as designer dogs rather than mixed breeds because they"re bred on purpose and are a combination of two known breeds. People who raise them hope to end up with the best of both worlds: for instance, the Pug"s laidback personality and the Beagle"s longer nose, which makes breathing easier. Sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn"t; it all depends on the shuffle of the genetic cards. Puggles are active. Not content to laze around the house, they play energetically indoors and out, racing around the dining room table and down the hall. Some enjoy digging outdoors. Expect to give them at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. Puggles are good walking companions, but they"re not the best choice if you want a jogging partner. Agility training is a good way to direct your fun-loving Puggle"s need for speed. Puggles are smart, but they may or may not be eager to please. Neither the Pug nor the Beagle is especially known for ease of training, and both breeds can be stubborn. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise, and keep training sessions short and sweet. Being a social dog, the Puggle gets along well with everyone. He usually enjoys the company of children and isn"t known for aggression toward other dogs. Puggles will bark to let you know when someone comes to the door, but given their friendly nature, they"re not guard dogs. Some are howlers, a trait inherited from their Beagle parent. The Puggle can be a cute and cuddly lovebug. Before you fall in love with that wrinkled face and hang-down ears, however, it"s important to understand that you could end up with a dog that displays one or more of the worst characteristics of the Pug and the Beagle, such as respiratory problems (Pug), stubbornness (Pug and Beagle), tendency to wander (Beagle), howling (Beagle), hip dysplasia (both), and eye problems (both). If you"re willing to welcome whatever surprises this little dog brings, you"re sure to enjoy life with your new dog.
The Puggle is a cross breed — a mix of the Pug and Beagle — rather than a true breed. Puggles are active and energetic. They need daily exercise and will enjoy a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes. Puggles shed, and need weekly brushing to get rid of loose or dead hair. They also require some special care to keep their skin folds and wrinkles clean and dry. Puggles are smart, but they can be stubborn. Train them with positive reinforcement techniques, such as food rewards, praise, and play. Puggles generally do well with other dogs and pets, although they may chase smaller pets.. Loving and gentle, the Puggle can make an excellent companion to anyone, including first-time dog owners, and will do well with children of all ages. Puggles are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety when they"re left alone for long periods. Puggles can adapt to any type of home, from city apartment to suburban house. However, beware if your housing has noise restrictions — barking or howling is a common trait in Puggles. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
The Puggle is the result of an accidental cross breeding between a Pug and a Beagle, probably sometime in the 1990s. The breed has become very popular, thaks to his novelty, sweet nature, and cute looks. There are no breed clubs for the Puggle, and no efforts to make him a recognized breed. Most litters are the result of first generation breedings between Beagles and Pugs, but there have been a few breedings of Puggles to Puggles.
Most Puggles are 13 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 18 to 30 pounds. Toy-size Puggles are usually less than 13 inches tall and weigh 8 to 17 pounds.
The Puggle is a sweet, intelligent dog who can fit easily into family life. They can be playful and cuddly and enjoy spending time with the people in their lives. Puggles usually get along well with everyone, including kids and other pets. Potential behavior problems include howling, barking, digging, or wandering. Like all dogs, Puggles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puggle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Not all Puggles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Stenotic Nares, also known as pinched nostrils, is a congenital disorder (meaning the dog is born with it). It affects dogs with short muzzles and makes it difficult for them to breathe. Signs include noisy breathing and exercise intolerance. Dogs that aren"t getting enough oxygen may have blue gums. Mild cases can be managed by preventing obesity, limiting exercise during hot or humid weather, and using a harness instead of a neck collar. More severe cases may require surgical repair. Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with daily medication. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog that is being treated for hypothyroidism can live a full and happy life. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Epilepsy is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of epilepsy, which can be either hereditary or of unknown cause. Cherry Eye occurs when the gland located in the dog"s third eyelid (known as the nictitating membrane) bulges out. It looks like a reddened mass at the inner corner of the eye. Cherry eye can be repaired surgically. If you"re buying a Puggle, it"s important to research the health conditions that affect both the Pug and the Beagle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, patellas (knees), and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Puggles are people-lovers and should live indoors with the family, not outside. So long as they"re indoor dogs and get enough exercise, they can adapt to any living situation, including apartments — although they can bark a lot. Some even have a tendency to howl, a trait they inherit from their Beagle parent. Puggles are intelligent but can be stubborn. They"ll respond best to training that uses positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Ample exercise will help keep them from becoming unruly. Give your Puggle a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes every day. Be sure to always walk your Puggle on leash or play with him in a securely fenced area. Beagles may ignore commands when they"ve picked up an interesting scent, and some Puggles have the same tendency.
Recommended daily amount: 5/8 to 1.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Like their parent breeds, Puggles enjoy their meals and are prone to obesity. Keep your Puggle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Puggle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Puggle has a short, smooth, double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, covered by a slightly longer topcoat. Colors include fawn, red, tan, lemon, black, or any of those colors with white (known as particolor). Some Puggles have black masks on the face. Puggles shed, like both their parent breeds. Brush your Puggle weekly to get rid of excess hair. Bathe him only as needed, but be sure to keep the folds on his skin and around his muzzle and eyes free of dirt, debris, and moisture to prevent infections. After a bath, it"s very important to dry thoroughly between any folds. Check your Puggle"s eyes regularly to ensure that they"re clean and free of any irritation, indicated by redness or discharge. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Puggle"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Puggle jumps up to greet you. Start grooming your Puggle when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Puggle is generally a sweet-tempered dog who gets along well with children of all ages. Even so, it"s important to always teach children how to approach and touch your Puggle, and to supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party. Puggles are sociable and generally do well with other dogs and pets. They may chase smaller pets, however, especially if they"ve inherited their Beagle parent"s hunting instincts. Proper training, plus lots of exposure to small pets, beginning in puppyhood, can minimize this trait.

The Puli, also known as the Hungarian Puli and the Hungarian Water Dog, is still used for herding sheep in his homeland. Hungarian shepherds take great pride in the Puli and his abilities; there"s a saying among Hungarian shepherds: "He"s not a dog, he"s a Puli." Pulik (the plural form of Puli) are self-confident, highly intelligent, and sensitive to their owners. Many tend to act as babysitters and guardians of children and other animals in the family. They can be very sensitive to the needs of the elderly and the sick. making them great therapy dogs. Although he"s affectionate and enjoys (and expects) the adoration of his family and friends, he"s suspicious of strangers. The Puli is a strong-willed dog who will attempt to boss you around (nicely), sometimes without you even realizing it. His instinct is to protect and herd, which can sometimes extend to telling you when it"s time to go to bed or where to sit, or moving the kids from one room to another. The distinct Puli coat, which can take about four years to grow in and cord completely, comes in solid colors of rusty black, black, all shades of gray, and white. In Hungary, a common color is fako, which is described as the color of the inside of a whole-wheat roll. His corded coat makes the Puli look much larger than he really is. The width of the coat across the back can be three times wider than the actual dog. Underneath all that hair, the Puli weighs about 30 pounds and stands 16 to 17 inches tall. This unique coat requires a great deal of grooming to keep it clean and attractive, however. It is not a coat for beginners. In fact, even many professional groomers do not know how to properly care for a corded coat — not necessarily because they"re lacking skills, but because the average pet owner rarely keeps a dog in cords. If your heart is set on owning a Puli, you"ll need to learn how to maintain the coat on your own. Ask advice from a Puli breeder, or find someone well-versed in grooming a corded coat. Some owners elect to trim off the coat to make it easier to care for, though diehard Puli enthusiasts cringe at the thought of this: the cords are a vital part of the Puli identity, they say. While trimming the coat off is perfectly acceptable for a pet, the show Puli appears only with cords in most countries. He can be shown with cords or brushed out in the United States, however. The Puli isn"t born with his dreadlocks. Newborns are round puppies with a little crimp to their coats, which soon grows into fluff. The adult coat comes in at about one year of age, at which time the fluff is separated by hand into cords. This process of separating the cords continues for about three or four months until the cords are set. At maturity (about four years of age), the coat reaches the ground. Cords on the head fall over the face, veiling the eyes. Some owners tie up these cords to keep them out of the dog"s face. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is essential for the Puli to teach him proper canine manners. Keep in mind that the Puli is highly intelligent and independent — so he becomes bored with repetitive training. Keep lessons fresh, short, and fun to maintain his interest. Agility and herding are two activities perfectly suited to the breed"s natural instincts and playful, spirited nature. In fact, if you try your hand at herding competitions with your Puli, don"t be surprised to see Border Collie enthusiasts watching your dog in awe. While Border Collies were bred to handle smaller flocks of sheep, the Puli typically handles flocks of 400 or more, and he looks like a tornado as he whirls around the flock to keep it under control. An added benefit to participating in canine sports is that it helps you fulfill a basic Puli need: being the center of attention.
The Puli is vocal and tends to bark. The Puli loves his family but is suspicious of strangers. Because he"s a highly intelligent dog with a great deal of self-confidence, the Puli gets bored with repetitive tasks, such as obedience. Agility and herding are much more to his liking. The Puli can be a bit stubborn, so housetraining might be a challenge at first. Crate training is recommended. Pulik have a reputation for remaining puppyish well into their older years. They love to play and like to have a lot of toys. Grooming the Puli is difficult, especially if the coat is corded. New owners should seek help to learn how to properly groom their dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Puli is an ancient breed with a history that reaches back at least 2,000 years. Some believe a dog similar to the Puli existed 6,000 or more years ago; others believe the Puli derived more recently from the Tibetan Terrier. Around the turn of the century, crews excavating for oil in what is now known as Iraq — once home to the ancient civilization known as Sumeria — came across the grave of a man who had been buried with a medium-sized dog and a sheep. Among the artifacts in the grave, they found a long, coarse knot of hair that was almost white with age. The makeup of that hair was very much like that of today"s Puli. It"s believed that this man was a shepherd, buried with his favorite sheepdog and a sheep. There are indications that the Sumerians used Pulik or Puli-type dogs to herd sheep thousands of years ago. Clay plaques found in excavations of the town of Eridu reveal the Sumerian laws about animals. One of these has lines that refer to a Puli and a Komondor, another herding dog. Also in the same excavation site, an undamaged statuette of a Puli was found in the crypt of an eight-year-old girl. About 1,100 years ago, Magyar tribesmen brought Pulik to Hungary, where they became prized for their herding abilities. Many of the shepherds preferred black dogs because they were easier to see among the white flocks. It"s thought that the Puli was used to herd and drive the sheep, while the larger Komondor was used to guard the flocks. Back then, a good Puli cost as much as a shepherd"s full year of wages. As much as they valued their dogs, however, they were ruthless in culling those who weren"t as intelligent or weren"t able to perform their duties well. Many think that this culling is the reason why the Puli is such an intelligent and healthy breed today. By the 1800s, the Hungarian shepherds determined the very best characteristics of these small sheepdogs, and they tried to breed specifically to produce high-quality animals. In the late 1800s, the first description of the Puli was written — but by then the need for the sheepdog was diminishing, and so were his numbers. In 1912, Dr. Emil Raitsits, a professor at the Hungarian University of Veterinary Medicine, began a program to save the Puli from extinction. Adolf Lendl, the director of the Budapest Zoo, joined in the efforts. Together they remodeled part of the zoo for an experimental breeding program and exhibit. The program expanded, and they eventually named their kennel Allatkert. The foundation stock for many Hungarian kennels came from the Allatkert Kennel. In 1915, enthusiasts wrote the first breed standard for the Puli. In 1924, the Federation Cynologique Internationale (International Kennel Club) approved this standard. At first there were three categories of Puli: the ancestral (working) Puli with a shaggy coat; the luxury or show Puli; and the dwarf Puli. In 1935, four sizes of Pulik were recognized: the police Puli (19.7 inches high); the working or medium Puli (15.7 to 19.7 inches); the small Puli (11.8 to 15.7 inches); and the dwarf, miniature, or toy Puli (11 inches and under). The medium-sized Puli was the most popular. By this time, owning a Puli, a Komondor, or other native Hungarian breeds became a source of pride in Hungary. About the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture became interested in the Puli and, in 1935, imported four purebred Pulik to take part in herding dog tests conducted at the Department"s facility in Beltsville, Maryland. The Puli were said to have scored high marks on these tests, though the results were never published. At the outbreak of World War II, the tests were stopped and the Pulik were sold to professional breeders. The original four dogs and their progeny are thought to be the first Pulik in the United States. World War II was devastating to Hungary and also to dog breeders, particularly those in Europe. Food was scarce and there were no medical supplies. Kennels had to give their valuable breeding stock to people in other countries, and the Pulik who were left behind were often killed by bombs or shot by German or Russian soldiers. If the breed hadn"t been so popular before the war, it probably would be extinct now. Just as the Puli survived the harsh plains of Hungary, he beat the odds and, after the war, the number of Pulik in Hungary grew. In 1959, the Hungarian Puli Club created a Puli breed standard that eliminated the toy and police-size Pulik and included all of the remaining sizes in one category. By the 1960s, the number of Pulik in Hungary had reached prewar numbers. The Puli was accepted for American Kennel Club registration in 1936, and the Puli Club of America was formed in 1951.
Males are 17 inches tall and weigh 30 to 35 pounds. Females are 16 inches tall and weigh 25 to 30 pounds.
The unusual corded coat often draws the attention of those unfamiliar with the breed. But to those who know and love the Puli, it"s his personality that stands out. The Puli is fun-loving and affectionate, and he enjoys the company of his family. He"s also smart, hardworking, and athletic. Being suspicious of strangers, he makes a good watchdog. He"s also a strong-willed dog who requires a firm but kind owner. Don"t be surprised when he tries to "herd" you or your children. Many Pulik are vocal and like to bark. A "quiet" command should be part of early training. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Puli needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pulik are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pulik will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pulik, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Cataracts: These afflictions cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.
The Puli is a herding dog at heart, and he does best in a home with enough space for him to race off his natural energy. A large, fenced yard (make that a very tall fence) or a farm is ideal. He can adjust to smaller living spaces, but be prepared for his running laps around the dining room chairs and taking leaps over the couch. Exercise and playtime aside, bring the Puli indoors to live with you. He"s a loyal companion who enjoys being with people, and he shouldn"t be permanently relegated to the backyard. The agile Puli is a good candidate for many canine sports, especially herding tests, agility, and obedience competition (though obedience work can seem repetitive to the fun-loving Puli). If he"s not a working dog, he needs the mental and physical challenges available in dog sports. Otherwise he can become bored, which can lead to destructive behaviors such as barking, digging, and chewing. The Puli"s agility can get him in trouble, however. It"s been reported that Pulik can jump six-foot fences, so be sure your yard has a secure, high fence to keep him from escaping and injuring himself. Proper training and socialization are essential for the strong-willed Puli. He must learn good canine manners, and you must learn not to be bossed around by him. This dog is a leader, and he will lead you if you allow him to.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Puli in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Puli, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Puli coat is considered to be nonshedding and hypoallergenic. Most Pulik are black, though white and gray are also found in the United States. In Hungary, the most common color after black is the brownish fako (described as the color of a whole-wheat roll). Black coats are described as a "weathered" black, because some white hairs begin to grow in when the dog is about a year old. In addition, because the cords don"t shed, they lose some of their color intensity over time due to exposure to the sun and air. Some Puli coats are self-cording, though most are helped along by humans who separate the cords by hand when the adult coat comes in (at about one year of age). As the coat texture changes from puppy fluff to adult coat, the undercoat is packed into the interior of the outer coat tendril to form a felt-like structure. It takes about four years for the coat to become fully mature. Keep the fluffy, uncorded Puli coat in good condition through regular brushing and combing to remove tangles and dirt and to distribute natural skin oils. The corded coat is never brushed but managed by hand: first it"s dampened with water, then the cords are separated and twirled. The length of the corded coat is sometimes trimmed to keep it from collecting dust and dirt. Bathing a fluffy Puli coat is like bathing any other breed. Put the dog in the tub, add water and soap, and scrub. Dunking your corded-coat Puli in the tub, however, is a time-consuming task that takes a lot of hard work. First, the cords must be thoroughly soaked with water (this takes a while), and then you can work in some diluted shampoo. Rinsing can take up to 30 minutes. Following that, the cords are squeezed dry, first by hand and then with a towel. After a bath, some owners put a heavy sweatshirt on the Puli to continue soaking up the water. Air-drying the coat can take up s tend to shed less than those who live in warmer climates. You can avoid matting — and excess hair on your furniture — if you commit to brushing your dog"s coat at least once a week during the year — and daily during shedding season.Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and will take the time to clean themselves — much like a cat will. They don"t typically emit "doggy" odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the backyard or find a stinky body of water to jump in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural oils in your dog"s skin and coat.Huskies come in a variety of colors and markings, from black to pure white with colored markings on the body that include reds and coppers. Their eyes can be brown, blue, or a combination. Their faces sport masks that add to their eye appeal.Brush your Husky"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Husky to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Huskies make great pets for households with children. They can be very tolerant of children, but like all other dogs, should be supervised when around young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Siberian Huskies do get along with other dogs but it is still important to take your puppy to socialization classes. This gets them used to other dogs and also to people, although they are also very affectionate to strangers. Socialization teaches puppies how to behave and greet other dogs and their owners.Keep in mind the history of this breed. The harsh conditions in Siberia created a strong prey drive in this breed because food was often hard to find. As a result, many Huskies today maintain that prey drive toward small animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and cats. Some Huskies, however, thrive in multi-pet households, especially when they are raised with other pets from puppyhood.

If you ever see a Pyr Shep run an agility course, you"ll be astonished by the enthusiasm and speed of this lean but muscular little herding dog. His movement is said to "shave the earth," and indeed, it almost looks as if he"s flying. To live with a Pyrenean Shepherd is to take on a highly energetic, intelligent, mischievous companion whose passion for you will be matched only by his desire to work. Be prepared to stimulate his mind and fulfill his need for activity with a challenging dog sport or some kind of flock that he can take charge of. Ever vigilant, he tends to be distrustful of strangers and makes an excellent watchdog. You should give your Pyr Shep plenty of socialization, beginning in early puppyhood, to ensure that his lively personality develops to its fullest potential.

The merry and gentle Redbone Coonhound descends from red hounds brought to North America by Scottish and Irish immigrants during colonial times. The medium-size, solid-red dogs have the pleading expression common to hounds everywhere and a sweet voice that sings out when they"re on the hunt. Unfortunately, they also bark a lot at home, so make sure you live out in the country or have very tolerant neighbors. Friendly and loyal, Redbone Coonhounds make good companion dogs as long as they get plenty of exercise. Plan to be patient while training this breed; they often suffer from canine attention deficit disorder.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be an imposing dog with its strong, muscular body, intense stare, and powerful stance. Many are interested in the breed because it looks like a tough dog but are surprised to learn that the Stafford is a sensitive and loving companion who enjoys playing more than being tough. He sees life as a joyful adventure and lives it to the fullest. Fans love the Staffordshire Bull Terrier for his small to medium size, short, easy-care coat, and dynamic yet gentle personality. With his short, broad head and muscular body, he resembles the other bull breeds such as American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers, but he is a breed unto himself with distinct physical characteristics that set him apart, including size and ear shape. The Stafford is known for his love of people and trustworthy nature. He has been described as "a sort of everybody"s Man Friday," and his greatest desire is to spend time with his people, whether that means vegging out on the sofa and watching football, running errands in the car, going for walks, or participating in activities such as agility, flyball, obedience, and therapy work. Expect to give this athletic and energetic dog a vigorous walk every day, as well as plenty of attention during downtime. He dislikes being left to his own devices. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are not a breed that can be left outside alone or at home for long periods of time without human companionship. Nicknamed the nanny dog, the Stafford is prized for his patience with and love of children, although it goes without saying that no dog should ever be left alone with young children or expected to double as a baby-sitter. He is not always so friendly toward dogs he doesn"t know however, a remnant of his origin as a fighting breed, which required him to be aggressive toward other dogs yet gentle with human handlers. Be aware that some municipalities restrict the ownership of bull breeds. Be sure that yours is not one of them before acquiring a Stafford. For the person who has an understanding of his sensitive nature and can give him patient, firm leadership, the Stafford is one of the finest dog companions around.
The SBT should not be left to live outside. He"s a companion dog and thrives in the presence of his family. Because he may be aggressive toward unknown dogs, a Stafford should never be walked off leash. Staffords are highly intelligent, but they are also freethinkers who like to do things their own way. They need firm, patient, consistent training. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are energetic dogs who need a vigorous walk or play session daily. SBTs enjoy their comforts and will readily join you on the sofa or bed if allowed. Staffords shed little, although they may have a heavy shed once a year. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny. The Stafford needs early socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals. The SBT is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. Staffords love to chew, especially during puppyhood. Provide them with tough, durable toys. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers. Reinforce the bottom of fences with concrete or chicken wire so they can"t dig beneath them. Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well in apartments if they are properly exercised, but ideal living quarters include a fenced yard where they can play. Staffordshire Bull Terriers do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overheat. Staffords love children, but despite their nickname of "nanny dog," they should not double as a baby-sitter. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs. If properly socialized and raised with them, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Staffordshire Bull Terriers will never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a strong prey drive which will send them after small animals around your neighborhood including cats. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a high pain threshold and can become injured without any outward sign, such as whining. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a restricted or banned breed in many cities and the number of cities restricting the breed is rising. It is important to research your city"s dog by-laws to avoid the unnecessary seizure and destruction of your dog. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are extremely mouthy as puppies and can be destructive if not closely supervised. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are protective of family members, but they are not too concerned about property. They are more likely to welcome burglars than to guard the silver. Never buy a Stafford from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier shares a common ancestor — the Bulldog — with the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier, and the Bull Terrier. It was created in the early nineteenth century to be smaller and faster in the fighting ring, yet gentle and friendly toward people. It was probably developed by crossing the Bulldog with an ancestor of the Manchester Terrier. The cross eventually evolved into the Staffordshire Bull Terrier we see today. The first Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed in England in 1835, and a breed standard was written shortly thereafter. In the United States, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier generally enjoyed life as a family companion, and it wasn"t until 1975 that the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Stafford registered with the AKC was named Tinkinswood Imperial. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America was founded in 1974. Today, the Stafford is ranked 85th among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC. They are excellent dogs who truly embody the description "man"s best friend," and many enthusiasts know that they own one of the best kept secrets of the dog world.
Staffords stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder, with males being taller. Male Staffords weigh 28 to 38 pounds; females, 24 to 34 pounds.
Loving toward people from just a few weeks of age, a proper Stafford is never shy or snarly. He is energetic and enthusiastic in everything he does and remains on alert, even in repose. This breed"s temperament is described as tough, courageous, tenacious (read: stubborn), and curious. A people-loving personality makes him a good caretaker of his family, but he"s less likely to be protective of property. Because he"s so attentive and interested in people, however, he"ll always alert you to the presence of visitors, wanted or unwanted. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Stafford puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all SBTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In SBTs, you should expect to see health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems may occur in the breed: Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition that is thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Patellar Luxation: This common problem occurs when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and often slips out of place, causing the dog to skip or hop when it happens. It is thought to be hereditary. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts: The development of opacity or cloudiness in the lens of the eye at an early age. This condition progresses rapidly, and dogs can be blind by 3 years of age. Surgery can sometimes partially restore vision. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. L-2 Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria: Affected dogs lack a particular enzyme to break down the aforementioned compound. It then builds up in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, causing such signs as lack of coordination, muscle tremors, poor learning ability, and seizures. Signs can be treated, but there is no cure. Dogs with this condition are usually euthanized at an early age. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. Buy only from breeders who use this DNA test to screen their breeding animals. Skin Allergies: Also known as atopic dermatitis, this itchy, scratchy condition is sometimes seen in certain Staffords. It"s not unusual for afflicted dogs to suffer hair loss or to develop sore spots on their skin. The problem is often compounded by bacterial infections. Aggressive flea control treatment can help, as can supplementing the diet with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil. Demodectic Mange: All dogs carry demodex mites. The mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems, but dogs with weakened or compromised immune systems can develop a condition called demodectic mange. Also called demodicosis, it can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The good news is that the mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a companion dog who does well in any type of home as long as he gets daily exercise. He should live indoors, with access to a securely fenced yard. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers, so it is important to reinforce fences by embedding them in concrete or burying chicken wire at the bottom to prevent escapes. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Stafford will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight. His short face makes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier unsuited to staying outdoors for more than a few minutes in a hot or humid climate, and he should always have access to shade and fresh drinking water. Some Staffords enjoy playing in water and will appreciate having a kiddie pool to lounge in on hot days, but others prefer to avoid the wet stuff. Staffords are not good swimmers, so take steps to protect them from falling into a swimming pool or spa. The Stafford"s exercise requirements can be satisfied with two or three half-hour to one-hour walks or playtimes daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities. Begin training the day you bring your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he can be impulsive and stubborn. Forget strict and formal obedience training. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Stafford. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog"s self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Stafford is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself. A Stafford is not generally a barker, but he is definitely vocal. This breed will entertain you with his snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as his singing voice, often described as a yodel. If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Stafford. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your SBT puppy from chewing on things he shouldn"t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren"t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Stafford will be a strong puller, small size notwithstanding. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Stafford"s safety. Never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals. He has a strong prey drive and will give chase if not restrained. Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your SBT to be friendly toward other animals. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn"t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Stafford will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 2 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your SBT in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the skin. Itta-offset="300"class="gpt-ad js-inview">

Like the mythical Greek hero Hercules, the Rottweiler is strong and true with a loving heart. Affectionately called Rotties or Rotts, the breed originated in Germany, where it was used to drive cattle and pull carts for farmers and butchers. That heritage is reflected in the Rottie"s broad chest and heavily muscled body. When he moves, he displays strength and stamina, but when you look into his eyes you see warm, dark-brown pools reflecting a mellow, intelligent, alert, and fearless expression.A well-bred Rottweiler is calm and confident. He"s typically aloof toward strangers, but never timid or fearful. Rottweilers exhibit a "wait-and-see" attitude when confronted with new people and situations. When these characteristics come together as they should, the Rottweiler is a natural guard dog with a mellow disposition who is successful not only in police, military, and customs work, but also as a family friend and protector.Rotties have a natural instinct to protect their families and can be ferocious in their defense. It"s essential to channel their power and protectiveness by providing early socialization, firm, fair, consistent training and leadership, and a regular job to perform. When this doesn"t happen, Rottweilers can become dangerous bullies rather than the companionable guardians they"re meant to be.Rottweilers walk a fine line between protectiveness and aggressiveness. If they aren"t carefully bred for a calm, intelligent temperament and properly socialized and trained, they can become overly protective. That might sound like what you want, but a Rottie who lacks the ability to discriminate is dangerous to everyone he encounters, not just the bad guys.You must be able to provide your Rottweiler with leadership he can trust and respect without resorting to anger or physical force. Otherwise, he"ll take the role of top dog for himself. With a dog as powerful and intelligent as the Rottweiler, this is a recipe for disaster.Despite what you might have heard, Rottweilers are not temperamentally unsound or inherently vicious. Well-bred, well-socialized Rotties are playful, gentle, and loving to their families. They are easy to train if treated with respect and make great companions.As wonderful as Rottweilers can be, they aren"t the dog for everyone. You must not only be dedicated to training and socializing your Rottie, you must also deal with people who don"t understand the breed and pre-judge it. Because of bad or tragic experiences with Rottweilers or other large breeds, some cities have banned the breed. It"s unfair to judge an entire breed by the actions of a few, but it"s a reality you will have to deal with if you own a Rottweiler.You can do your part to redeem the reputation of the breed by training your Rottweiler to obey and respect people. Most important, don"t put your Rottie in the backyard and forget about him. This is a dog who is loyal to his people and wants to be with them. If you give him the guidance and structure he needs, you"ll be rewarded with one of the finest companions in the world.
Rottweilers are large, powerful dogs and require extensive socialization and training from early puppyhood. Even if you train and socialize your Rottweiler, expect to be subjected to sometimes unfair advance judgments about your dog, maybe even having untrue allegations made about him and his activities, by those who fear him. Because of the current prejudice against dogs such as Rottweilers and claims that they can be dangerous, you may have to carry extra liability insurance to own one, depending upon the ordinances in your town. In some areas, you may not even be able to own a Rottweiler, or may be forced to give up any that you have. Rottweilers love people and want to be with their families. If they are left alone for long periods of time or don"t receive adequate exercise, they may become destructive. If raised with children, well-bred Rottweilers get along fine with them. They must be taught, however, what is acceptable behavior with children. Rotties have a natural instinct to herd and may "bump" children to herd them. Because of their size, this "bump" may cause toddlers to fall down and injure themselves. In addition, some Rottweilers have a strong prey drive and may get overly excited when children run and play. Always supervise your Rottweiler when he"s around children. If you have an adult Rottweiler, introduce new animals, especially dogs, carefully. Rottweilers can be aggressive toward strange dogs, particularly those of the same sex. Under your leadership, however, your Rottie will probably learn to coexist peacefully with his new companion. Rottweilers are intelligent and are highly trainable if you"re firm and consistent. Rottweilers will test you to see if you really mean what you say. Be specific in what you ask, and don"t leave any loopholes for them to exploit. Rottweilers require a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks or playtimes daily. Rottweilers have a double coat and shed heavily in the spring and the fall, moderately throughout the rest of the year. Many Rottweilers snore. If their food intake is not monitored, Rotties have a tendency to overeat and can gain weight. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Rottweilers descend from the Molossus, a mastiff-type dog. Their ancestors marched to Germany with the Romans, driving the cattle that sustained them as they conquered the known world. As the army traveled, the big dogs mated with dogs that were native to the areas they passed through and laid the foundation for new breeds.One of the areas through which they passed was southern Germany, where the Romans set up colonies to take advantage of climate and soil, which were suitable for agriculture. They built villas roofed with red tile. More than 600 years later, as they were building a new church, inhabitants of the town excavated the site of the ancient Roman baths and uncovered one of the red-tiled villas. The discovery inspired a new name for the town: das Rote Wil (the red tile).Over the centuries, Rottweilers flourished as a market area for cattle, the German equivalent of a Texas cowtown, and the descendants of the Roman Molossus dogs drove the cattle to town for butchering. To keep their money safe from thieves after selling their livestock, the cattlemen put their filled purses around their Rottweiler"s neck when they returned home. Butchers in the area also used the dogs to pull carts loaded with meat.Eventually, rail transport replaced cattle drives. The Rottweiler nearly became extinct. At a dog show in Heilbronn, Germany, in 1882, only one nondescript Rottweiler was exhibited. That situation began to change in 1901, when the Rottweiler and Leonberger Club was founded and the first Rottweiler breed standard was written. The description of the Rottweiler"s appearance and character has changed little since then.Rottweilers began to be used in police work, for which they were well suited. Several Rottweiler breed clubs were formed over the years, but the one with staying power was the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK), founded in 1921. The ADRK survived World War II and has continued to promote good breeding programs in Germany and throughout the world. It"s dedicated to preserving the working ability of the Rottweiler.It"s thought that the first Rottweiler came to the U.S. with a German emigrant in the late 1920s. The first litter was whelped in 1930, and the first dog registered by the American Kennel Club was Stina v Felsenmeer in 1931.After World War II, the breed started becoming more popular. At that time, it was primarily known as an excellent obedience dog. The height of the Rottweiler"s popularity was in the mid-1990s when more than 100,000 were registered with the American Kennel Club.Being popular isn"t necessarily a good thing when you"re a dog. It"s not unusual for irresponsible breeders and puppy mills to try to cash in on the popularity of a breed and start producing puppies without regard for health and temperament problems. This is what happened to the Rottweiler breed until bad publicity and the demand for them decreased.Dedicated, reputable breeders are taking this chance to turn the breed around and ensure that Rottweilers are the type of dogs they were meant to be. Today, Rottweilers rank 17th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Males typically are 24 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 95 to 130 pounds. Females typically are 22 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 85 to 115 pounds.
The ideal Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous, never shy. He has a self-assured aloofness and doesn"t make friends with people immediately or indiscriminately. Instead, he takes a wait-and-see attitude with new people or situations. With his family, he"s affectionate, often following them around the house. This is not a highly excitable dog. He has an inherent desire to protect his family and property, but should never be aggressive toward people without cause. The Rottweiler is smart and adaptable with a strong work ethic.You"ll see some differences between the sexes. Males are quiet but watchful, constantly assessing their surroundings for threats. Females are somewhat easier to control and may be more affectionate. Both are highly trainable but can be stubborn.Rottweilers require firm, consistent but not harsh discipline. A sharp word is often a sufficient reprimand, but only if you"ve clearly established your leadership. If not, he may try to bully or bluff you. This is not a dog for people who lack assertiveness or don"t have time to devote to training and supervision. Earning a Rottweiler"s respect involves setting boundaries and teaching consequences for inappropriate behavior, both of which take time and patience.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Rotties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Rottweiler puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Rottweilers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Rotties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Rotties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dyplasia: Elbow dysplasia is a hereditary malformation of the elbow joint. The severity of the dysplasia can only be determined by x-rays. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain. Aortic Stenosis/Sub-aortic Stenosis (AS/SAS): This common heart defect is sometimes seen in Rottweilers. The aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It"s an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn"t known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don"t suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss. Gastric Dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like Rottweilers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeder and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Panosteitis (Pano): This is sometimes referred to as "growing pains" because it usually occurs in puppies when they are around four months old. The primary symptom is lameness. Often, rest will be all that is needed, but if your puppy starts limping, it"s a good idea to have your vet check him. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.
It"s important for Rottweilers to live in the home with their people. If they"re left alone in a backyard all the time, they can become bored, destructive, and aggressive. Although they"re large, Rottweilers are inactive indoors.A Rottweiler is a homebody, but he requires a fenced yard not only to protect him from traffic but also because he can be aggressive toward other dogs and strangers who come onto his property. An underground electronic fence can"t keep your Rottie in your yard if he really wants to get out. More important, it doesn"t prevent people or other animals from coming onto your property. Put up a sign advising strangers and non-family members not to come onto your property without your escort.The Rottweiler"s energy level ranges from couch potato to whirlwind. Be sure to tell the breeder what kind of energy level suits you so she can help you choose the best puppy for your lifestyle. Moderately active Rottweilers will appreciate a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks each day. They also enjoy playing with balls and going hiking. More energetic Rotties may need longer exercise times and more structured activities. Their athleticism, intelligence, and trainability make them well suited to agility and obedience competition, as well as tracking, therapy work, and their traditional job, pulling a cart or wagon. Perfect for parades!When training your Rottweiler, keep in mind that he thrives on mental stimulation. He likes to learn new things and is eager to please you. He might be willful at times, with a "Show me why I should do this" attitude. Be fair, consistent, and firm, and your Rottweiler will reward you with his quick ability to learn.Your Rottweiler shouldn"t be difficult to housetrain given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 10 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Rottweiler in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Rottie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Rottweilers have a short double coat that"s straight and coarse. The outer coat is medium in length, shorter on the head, ears, and legs; the undercoat is found mainly on the neck and thighs. The amount of undercoat your Rottie has depends on the climate in which he lives.The Rottweiler is always black with markings that are rust to mahogany in color. The markings appear over the eyes, on the cheeks, on each side of the muzzle, on the chest and legs, and beneath the tail. There are also tan lines that resemble pencil marks on the toes.Brush your Rottie weekly with a firm bristle brush to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. He"ll shed twice a year, and you"ll probably want to brush more frequently during that time to keep the loose hair under control. Bathe him as needed. If you bathe him outdoors, it should be warm enough that you"re comfortable without wearing long sleeves or a coat. If you aren"t, it"s too cold to be giving your Rottie a bath out there.Brush your Rottie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin accustoming your Rottweiler to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Rottweilers typically like children, especially if they"re raised with them. When around children, especially young ones, they should be supervised because they are so big and strong. Because of their cattle-driving heritage, they have a tendency to lean and push and can accidentally topple a toddler with a nudge.They"re probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. It"s also important to supervise your Rottweiler any time your children have friends over. Rotties can be perturbed by loud or rough play between kids and may take steps to put a stop to it, not understanding that "his" children aren"t in danger. They may also chase young children who are running.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.When Rottweilers are raised with other dogs and cats, they generally get along well with them. They may have issues with strange dogs or adult dogs that are introduced into the home, being intolerant of same-sex dogs. With your training and guidance, however, they should accept new animals peaceably. Keep your Rottie on leash in public to prevent aggression or belligerence toward other dogs. The Rottie is not the best candidate for visiting off-leash dog parks.

A late night cold sufferer fills the TV screen. His night-time affliction causes him to toss and turn, each cough painful and every sneeze wracking his body. Then a deep-throated bark draws this invalid to his door, where he finds a massive dog with a flask attached to his collar. By the end of the commercial, the Saint Bernard has done his job and the cold sufferer is fast asleep. The Saint Bernard did in fact rescue people from the cold — not the virus, of course, but the chill winds and snows of the Alps, so treacherous to travelers. Not surprisingly, he"s a kind, gentle, intelligent, good-natured dog. He"s also a giant, a large, muscular dog who can reach a height of 30 inches and a weight of 180 pounds. The Saint comes in shorthaired and longhaired varieties, the shorthaired being the one preferred by the monks of the Saint Bernard Hospice where the dogs originated. Despite his size, the Saint Bernard is a quiet indoor dog who makes a wonderful family friend. Although he"s calm indoors, it"s nice if he has easy access to a yard where he can have a little room to spread out. He can live in small quarters, however, as long as he gets a good daily walk. More important than the size of your home is your tolerance for mess. Saints aren"t the best choice for a fastidious housekeeper. They drool and shed, and they track in mud and dirt. With this breed, saintliness is not necessarily next to cleanliness. Saints aren"t suited to living outdoors with little human companionship. They need to live in the home with their family. They"re not aggressive, but they"ll bark when there is cause, and any threat to their people will bring out their protective instincts. Their size is usually a deterrent to any would-be attacker or burglar. The easygoing Saint is gentle and patient with children if not necessarily playful. He"s great to snuggle with while reading or watching television, but he can be a bit much for younger children, accidentally knocking them over with a swipe of his tail. The Saint Bernard does not need a lot of exercise. He"s not a jogging companion and will wilt in hot climates. Saints suffer from heat exhaustion quite easily and need access to shade and plenty of fresh, cool water during hot weather. On the other hand, you"ll never find a happier Saint Bernard than one who"s enjoying a good romp in the snow. On a sadder note, the Saint"s giant size condemns him to a shorter than average canine life span. He also can suffer from a variety of genetic diseases and disorders. The St. Bernard is a much-loved breed today. He"s versatile, good-natured, and a fine choice for the person or family who would like a large but gentle dog with moderate exercise needs.
A Saint Bernard is a giant-size breed and although they are generally quiet inside, they are not best suited to apartments. They need space to move or just to stretch out in. If you consider yourself a neat freak, then the Saint Bernard is not the breed for you. They drool and their paws track in their fair share of mud. They are heavy shedders and shed, or blow, their coat twice a year. Saint Bernards generally take longer to mature mentally. This leaves you with a very big puppy for several years. Although Saint Bernards make wonderful family pets, they are not recommended for homes with young children, as they can unintentionally knock over and hurt small children. Originally bred to withstand the cold temperatures of the Alps, the Saint Bernard does not do well in heat. Saint Bernards are not known for barking without cause. Saint Bernards are a short-lived breed, usually only 8 to 10 years. The Saint Bernard should not live outdoors away from his family. All dogs do better when they are in the house with the family they love, and the Saint Bernard is no exception. Although their coats and build make them an obvious choice for outdoor living, their temperament and inability to cope with heat makes it a poor decision. Thanks to the popularity of movies such as Beethoven, which features a large Saint Bernard, many irresponsible breeders and puppy mills produce these gentle giants. To make sure you get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Saint Bernard originated in Switzerland along with several other breeds, including the Bernese Mountain Dog, Entlebuch Cattle Dog, Appenzell Cattle Dog, and Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. They probably were created when dogs native to the Alps were crossed with Mastiff-type dogs that came with the Roman army during the time of the emperor Augustus. By the first millennium CE, dogs in Switzerland and the Alps were grouped together and known simply as Talhund" (Valley Dog) or "Bauernhund" (Farm Dog). The Saint Bernard Pass is a well-known and treacherous alpine pass that lies roughly 8,000 feet above sea level and can only be traveled between July and September. Today remnants of the great Roman road can be seen, as well as evidence of Napoleon"s crossing. Archdeacon Bernard de Menthon arrived at this pass, which would eventually be named after him, in 962 AD, and there he founded his hospice, which aided travelers who were overcome by crossing this treacherous pass. That"s when the Saint Bernard"s history began to branch out from the Talhund or Bauerhund. It is unclear when the dogs were first used by the Hospice, but a painting depicting well-built shorthaired dogs that greatly resembled Saint Bernards as they are today was painted in 1695. The first written mention of the breed in the monastery"s records was in 1703. The dogs were probably originally used by the hospice monks to guard the grounds. When the monks went in search of lost travelers, they may have brought along the dogs for protection and discovered by accident that they were excellent pathfinders with an ability to locate helpless travelers. The isolation of the monastery probably contributed to the refinement of the dogs into a breed that could withstand harsh winters and had the physical characteristics needed for their search and rescue work. The Hospice"s breeding stock was occasionally replenished by dogs from the lower valleys, many of which were puppies of the hospice dogs that weren"t needed at the time of their birth. In 1830, the monks attempted to improve their dogs" coats by crossing them with the thick-coated Newfoundland. That was a mistake. The longhaired offspring were inferior because ice built up in their longer coats. After that time, the monks gave away or sold any longhaired puppies they produced. During the three centuries for which the Hospice has records, Saint Bernards were credited with saving more than 2,000 travelers. By the 1800s, the hospice dogs did not have a formal name, although they were well known. Between 1800 and 1810, a hospice dog named Barry was credited with 40 finds and became one of the most famous dogs to ever live. Often the dogs were referred to as Barryhunden in his honor. The English referred to them as Sacred Dogs and imported many of them into England in an effort to reinvigorate their own Mastiff breed. In Germany, the name Alpendog was suggested for the breed in the 1820s. In 1833, a man by the name of Daniel Wilson suggested that the breed be referred to as the Saint Bernard Dog, and that"s eventually what they became when the Swiss Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1880. When the breed began to be known in other countries, the Saint Bernard"s type started to change. The Saint Bernards in other countries became thinner and taller, the by-product of crossbreedings. In 1887, the International Congress of Zurich drew up the first breed standard and all countries, except England, accepted it. In the United States, a Saint Bernard named Plinlimmon became well known in 1883. Plinlimmon was owned by an actor and became the top-winning Saint Bernard show dog of his time. His owner took him across the country, exhibiting him at theaters. In 1888, the Saint Bernard Club of America (SBCA) was founded, and the club accepted the breed standard written by the Swiss. Saints rank 39th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club. Today, Saint Bernards can be seen in homes, on the big screen, and at dog shows. There are still Saint Bernards at the Saint Bernard Hospice in Switzerland. They no longer seek out travelers in need but instead serve as living representatives of hospice history.
Male Saint Bernards stand 28 to 30 inches at the shoulder and weigh 140 to 180 pounds; females are 26 to 28 inches and weigh 120 to 140 pounds.
True to their heritage as hospice dogs, Saints are friendly and welcoming. They have a steady, benevolent temperament and are kind and careful with children. They love attention but aren"t as demanding of it as some breeds. Because of their large size, it"s important to begin training Saints at an early age, while they"re still easily manageable. They"re intelligent and willing to please but sometimes stubborn. They should never be aggressive unless it"s in defense of a family member. Like every dog, Saint Bernards need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saint Bernard puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Saints are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Saints will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Saints, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, medication to control the pain, or weight management. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Saint has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically. Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Saint has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: This heart condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog"s vision. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect deep-chested dogs such as Saint Bernards, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food might also be factors in bloat. It is more common among older dogs, but can occur at any age. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it"s recommended that dogs who develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.
Saint Bernards need only moderate amounts of exercise, but it"s important that they get it to prevent obesity. Carrying too much weight is hard on their joints and can cause arthritis or orthopedic problems. Limit the amount of exercise you give your Saint Bernard puppy until he reaches mature size. Don"t let him put on weight too quickly or run or jump on slick floors. That"s just asking for hip problems. Saint Bernards are prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Avoid letting them exercise in the heat of the day, and be sure they always have access to shade and fresh water. Be aware of the signs of fatigue and heat exhaustion, which include heavy panting, dark-red gums, and weakness or collapse. An untrained Saint can wreak havoc in your home and drag you down the sidewalk in his eagerness to greet people, so early training is essential. Train your Saint Bernard using a happy and relaxed approach. Lay down ground rules and be consistent in requiring that he follow them. Saint Bernards are naturally friendly, but all puppies benefit from puppy socialization class to help them learn how to properly react to other dogs and strangers. Investing in puppy kindergarten and obedience classes, as well as spending 10 to 15 minutes per day practicing at home, will be well worth your time, effort, and money. Crate training is an important tool that breeders will recommend. It aids in housetraining, keeps your dog or puppy and your belongings safe, and is a safe haven where your Saint Bernard can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment but instead should be viewed by your dog as a cozy refuge. The well-trained Saint Bernard is a wonderful family companion and can go on to do many fun activities, including conformation showing (dog shows), obedience trials, and cart pulling.
Recommended daily amount: 5 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Saint Bernards like to eat and are prone to obesity. Keep your Saint in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Saint Bernard, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Saint Bernards can be found in two coat types: shorthaired and longhaired. The shorthaired coat is smooth but dense. The hair is slightly bushy on the thighs, and the tail is covered with long, dense hair that becomes shorter toward the tip. The longhaired coat is slightly wavy but never curly or shaggy. The forelegs have a bit of feathering, but the thighs and tail are bushy. Saint Bernards are various shades of red with white or white with red. The red comes in various shades, from brindle patches with white markings to brownish-yellow. The white occurs on the chest, around the neck (known as the collar), around the nose (the noseband), and on the feet and tip of the tail. A white spot on the nape of the neck and a white blaze on the face are especially attractive and desirable, as are dark markings on the head and ears that resemble a mask. The white markings are said to resemble the liturgical vestments worn by a priest and the black mask to reduce the glare from the snow. Brush your Saint about three times a week with a rubber curry brush or hound glove for shorthaired coats or a pin brush for longhaired coats. During shedding season, use a shedding blade to remove loose hair. If your Saint develops mats behind the ears or on the thighs, spray a detangler solution on the area and gently work out the mat with your fingers or a comb. St. Bernards don"t need to be bathed frequently. When you do give a bath, it"s easiest to do it outdoors unless you have a large walk-in shower. Wintertime baths should always be given indoors unless you live in a climate that"s warm year-round. Use a shampoo made for dogs to ensure that the coat doesn"t become dry. You may want to use a whitening shampoo to keep the coat its whitest and brightest. Saint Bernards often develop stains around their eyes. Keep the eyes stain-free by wiping them daily with a damp cloth or using a product formulated to remove eye stains, which you can find at pet supply stores. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene, nail care, and ear care. Brush your Saint"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Saint enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. When you trim the nails, trim the hair between the toes at the same time. Check ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them clean with a cotton ball, using an ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. Never insert a cotton swab into the ear canal. Begin accustoming your Saint to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early. If you are unsure about how to groom your Saint Bernard, ask your dog"s breeder for advice or take your Saint to a professional groomer.
Saints are, well, saintly around kids. Patient and gentle, they step carefully around them and will put up with a lot. That doesn"t mean they should have to, though. Supervise interactions between young children and Saints to make sure there"s no ear- or tail-pulling, biting, or climbing on or knocking over on the part of either party. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs and never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how trustworthy or well trained, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Saints can also get along well with other pets, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood. Supervise them around smaller dogs and cats just to make sure they don"t accidentally step or lie on them.

The Saluki"s origins are shrouded in the sands of time, but his history is believed to go back to antiquity. He is the very definition of grace and speed, well deserving of the name bestowed on him by his Arab breeders — The Noble. The Saluki is bred for speed, strength, and endurance, qualities that are evident in his long, narrow head and sleek yet muscular body. Beautiful but reserved, the Saluki is affectionate without being overly demonstrative. He"s happy to prove his loyalty through quiet companionship. Not everyone is offered the gift of a Saluki"s devoted friendship, but those happy few who receive it are appreciative of the honor. Salukis are widely admired for their exotic appearance, but not everyone is well suited to live with this spirited and independent hunter. Any movement, be it a squirrel, cat, or radio-controlled car, will activate the Saluki"s instinct to chase, and his speed has been clocked at 30 to 35 miles per hour. Unless he"s protected by a strong human on the other end of the leash or a securely fenced yard, he"s likely to meet his end beneath the wheels of a car. You might think that Salukis living in the country would have fewer issues, but they"ve been known to chase down and tangle with or kill goats, otters, foxes, raccoons, snakes, squirrels, and deer. To keep a Saluki safe and well exercised, provide him with 300 to 400 lateral feet of fenced area where he can run full out. If your yard isn"t that large, you should have easy access to a fenced park, an enclosed sports field at a school, or a beach with no nearby road. On leash, the Saluki makes an excellent jogging companion — if you can keep up with him. He"s also a good competitor in agility and lure coursing. Some Salukis participate in obedience and tracking as well. Indoors, the Saluki will make himself at home on your soft sofa or bed. He likes his comforts and needs cushioning for his somewhat bony body. Using his long, skinny muzzle, he"ll surf your kitchen counters in search of anything edible. The calm and gentle Saluki can become timid and shy without early socialization and regular reinforcement through new experiences and introductions to many different people throughout his life. Generally quiet but alert, he"s a good watchdog, but not a guard dog. Salukis are fearless in the hunt but otherwise unaggressive. Training a Saluki is possible, but don"t expect the perfect obedience you might have from a Golden Retriever. Salukis think for themselves, and if something else is more interesting than what you"re asking them to do, they"re perfectly happy to ignore you. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, never harsh verbal or physical corrections. Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. While Salukis aren"t overly demonstrative, they do become strongly attached to their people and dislike being left alone for long periods. Consider a Saluki if you have time to give to a devoted, graceful friend who can run like the wind.
Salukis love to run and need regular daily exercise. They must be kept on leash whenever they"re not in a securely fenced area. They have a strong prey drive and will pursue anything furry and in motion, heedless of their owner"s commands. Salukis are a reserved breed although they"re devoted to their people. Early and ongoing socialization is important for this breed to prevent shyness and skittishness. Salukis are not recommended for apartments. They require a large fenced yard where they can run safely. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended; their prey drive is so strong they"ll push past it. It is important to provide comfortable bedding for a Saluki since he doesn"t have enough body fat to provide padding. Salukis should not live outdoors. They thrive on human companionship and will become depressed if left alone for long periods. Although these dogs can make gentle and calm companions for older children, they are not recommended for homes with small children. Salukis are generally quiet dogs. When training a Saluki, be consistent, and use only positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, since the breed is so sensitive. Salukis are fastidious and like to be clean. They shed little and require only weekly brushing. Salukis should not reside in homes that have small pets. Even with the best training, a Saluki will view small pets as prey and will try to hunt them. Salukis prefer the companionship of other Salukis, but they can get along with other dogs that do not have dominant natures. Salukis can be picky eaters. Never buy a Saluki from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
Once known as the Persian Greyhound or the gazelle hound, the Saluki has long been considered one of the most ancient of breeds. Recent genetic evidence confirms this to be the case. Scientists speculate that Salukis and other ancient breeds descend from the first dogs and made their way through the world with their nomadic owners. Depictions of dogs resembling Salukis — with a Greyhoundlike body and feathering on the ears, tail, and legs — appear on Egyptian tombs dating to 2100 B.C.E., some 4,000 years ago. Even older are carvings from the Sumerian empire (7,000-6,000 B.C.E.) that show dogs with a striking resemblance to the Saluki. Pharaohs hunted gazelles and hares with Salukis, which often worked in partnership with falcons. The dogs were frequently honored with mummification after death. Nomadic Muslims, who generally despised dogs as unclean animals, considered Salukis a gift from Allah and referred to the dogs by the honorific El Hor, meaning The Noble. Salukis were the only dogs permitted to sleep inside the tents. The breed may take its name from the ancient city of Saluk, in Yemen, or perhaps from the city of Seleukia in Syria. Another theory suggests that the name is a transliteration of the Arabic word for hound. Salukis were widespread in the Middle East and could be found in Persia (modern-day Iran), Syria, Egypt, Palestine, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and Arabia. The first documented case of Salukis arriving in Britain was in 1840, but it wasn"t until after World War I, when many British officers returned with them from the Middle East, that the breed became established in Great Britain. Interest in the Saluki was slower to take hold in the United States. The Saluki Club of America was founded in 1927, the same year the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Saluki registered by the AKC was Jinniyat of Grevel in 1929. Today the Saluki is a rare treasure, ranking 116th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Saluki males stand 23 to 28 inches at the shoulder; females are significantly smaller. Weight ranges from 35 to 70 pounds.
The Saluki is an aloof dog, but one who"s devoted to his family. He"s gentle and thrives on quiet companionship. He has a tendency to bond with a single person, which can lead to separation anxiety. With strangers, Salukis are reserved, and they can be shy if they"re not socialized at an early age. Socialization should continue throughout their life. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They"re sensitive dogs and will pick up on and become stressed by tensions in the home. Salukis love comfort and enjoy being pampered with soft bedding and access to furniture. Like cats, they"re fastidious about personal cleanliness. Like every dog, Salukis need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saluki puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
The Saluki is a hardy breed that does not suffer from many genetically inherited diseases. The following problems may be seen in Salukis: Anesthesia Sensitivity: Because of their low level of body fat, sighthounds such as the Saluki have a reputation for being sensitive to anesthesia and certain other drugs. Fortunately, the new drugs available these days have properties that make sighthound reactions to drugs much less likely. In addition, most veterinarians are aware of the special anesthesia and drug needs of sighthounds, but it never hurts to confirm this awareness if you"re taking your Saluki to a new veterinarian. Hemangiosarcoma: This malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels and the spleen. Cardiomyopathy: This disease of the heart muscle takes two forms: dilated and hypertrophic. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the progressive enlargement of the ventricles, the heart"s main pumping chambers. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes a drastic increase in heart muscle mass. DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and tends to affect young to middle-aged males in larger breeds. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Salukis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for cardiac (heart) and thyroid disease. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
Salukis are not suited for apartment life. They need a home with a large, securely fenced yard where they can run flat out. The ideal running area for a Saluki is 300 to 400 feet in length or width. Fences should be at least five to six feet high or a Saluki will easily jump them. Underground electronic fencing will not contain a Saluki, nor will it protect him from other animals that might enter your yard. Keep your Saluki on leash whenever he"s not in an enclosed area. A Saluki was bred for hunting and has a strong prey drive. If he sees anything fast and furry, he"ll pursuit it for as long as he can, disregarding any commands to come or stop. Salukis are indoor dogs and require soft, cushioned bedding to prevent calluses from forming. Place food well out of reach of the Saluki"s inquiring nose. That means behind closed doors or up about seven feet. Salukis are intelligent and learn quickly, but they"re also independent and can be stubborn, which makes training a challenge. To hold your Saluki"s attention, keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. If a Saluki becomes bored, he will choose not to learn. Use positive reinforcement, never harsh verbal or physical corrections.
Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Salukis are the supermodels of the dog world and can be picky eaters. Remember that they are supposed to look sleek, and you may just barely see the outline of their ribs beneath their skin. For more on feeding your Saluki, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Saluki has a short, smooth, silky body coat. The entire body can be smooth, or the Saluki can have slight feathering on the legs, the backs of the thighs and sometimes the shoulders, and the underside of the tail. The long ears are covered with silky hair. Salukis come in white, cream, fawn, golden, grizzle and tan, black and tan, and tricolor (white, black, and tan). The pigmentation of the nose is black or liver. Salukis are a clean, low-shedding breed with no doggy odor. Brush the coat weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Comb feathering once or twice a week to remove tangles. A wipedown with a damp cloth is generally enough to keep your Saluki clean, so bathe him only if he"s dirty. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Saluki"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Saluki jumps up to greet you. Begin getting your Saluki used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Salukis can make excellent companions for older children, but they aren"t recommended for homes with young children. They"re tolerant, but young Salukis can be too active for children younger than 8 years of age, and their thin skin and knobby bones make them vulnerable to injury if children aren"t careful. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They won"t chase small dogs or cats in their own household, but other animals, such as pet birds, mice, rabbits, or hamsters could prove too much of a temptation.

It"s known as the "Sammy smile," the slight, but discernible, upturned corners of the Samoyed"s mouth. This is a happy, good-natured dog with a glass half-full attitude toward life and the people he lives with. The Samoyed"s fondness for humans probably stems from his close association with the Samoyede (now know as the Nenetsky) people who bred and raised him thousands of years ago on the Taimyr Peninsula of Siberia. The dogs pulled sleds, herded reindeer, hunted game, and protected the Samoyede against predators. The dogs also lived with the people, played with the children (which he still enjoys), and helped keep them warm in the cold climate. To this day, the Samoyed"s reputation as an intelligent, dignified, family dog is well deserved. He often chooses to dote on one special person in the household, but he is affectionate with everyone in the pack. Happiest when he is part of family life, this breed needs to be with people. In fact, leaving a Samoyed alone too much is the best way to make him miserable. Along with his smile, the Sammy"s defining trait is his ultra-thick white coat. In the winter months, it"s so dense you can barely see his skin underneath — which means heavy shedding in the spring. And believe it or not, Samoyed "wool" is a favorite of weavers; the wool is carded, spun, and woven or knitted into warm, beautiful clothing. As gorgeous as it is, the Sammy coat is a bear to groom. Owners must be diligent brushers to make sure it doesn"t tangle and mat. And as you might guess, come shedding time, the amount of white hair around the house, yard, on the furniture, and stuck to your clothes can be overwhelming. That said, to the owner who can handle the responsibility, a well-groomed Samoyed is a sight for sore eyes. As friendly and smart as this breed is, the Samoyed is challenging to own. He can be a talkative dog, voicing his likes and dislikes with bellows, howls, or barks. It"s best to keep this working dog busy, otherwise he"s likely to resort to annoying or destructive behaviors such as digging, jumping the fence, getting into garbage, or chewing shoes. His hunting instinct is strong, so it"s difficult for him to resist chasing squirrels, rabbits, or even cats. Even a well-trained Samoyed can"t be trusted off leash. Training the Samoyed is also challenging. This breed is smart, and learns quickly, but you must approach training with the right attitude. Give the him something to figure out; don"t bore him with repetition. Agility and tracking make perfect "thinking exercises" for the Samoyed.
The Samoyed"s white, fluffy coat is beautiful, but to keep it in good condition requires rigorous grooming. Shedding could be the Samoyed"s middle name — he does so profusely once or twice a year. Expect to brush the dog and vacuum your home daily during shedding season. The Samoyed doesn"t like to sit around — he likes to be busy. Keep him active with walks, games, hikes, and canine sports. The Samoyed"s characteristic smile reveals his friendly, good-natured disposition. He is especially fond of children. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The hardy and sweet-tempered Samoyed was originally used to hunt, herd reindeer, and haul sledges for the Siberian Samoyede people. It is said that the Samoyede treated these working dogs kindly, allowing them to join in with family activities at the end of a day. It was this closeness that created a sense of trust and loyalty in the breed that remains today. The Samoyed journeyed out of Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the early part of the 20th century to pull sledges on polar expeditions, including Sir Ernest Shackleton"s famous journey to the Antarctic. These dogs endured terrible hardships along with the explorers they assisted. Only the strongest and fittest dogs survived such expeditions. A Samoyed named Antarctic Buck is said to be the very first brought to England. Queen Alexandra was an enthusiast of the breed and many present-day English and American Sammies are descended from her kennels. The first standard for the breed was adopted in England in 1909. The original Samoyed Club of America was organized in 1923, the same year the American breed standard was adopted.
Males stand 21 to 23.5 inches tall. Females stand 19 to 21 inches tall. Males and females weigh 50 to 60 pounds.
The well-bred Samoyed is an intelligent, gentle, and loyal dog. He is friendly and affectionate with his family, including the children, and thrives on being part of household activity. The Samoyed is not a "lone wolf" dog — he enjoys close association with those he lives and is mentally and physically unsuited for being left alone in a kennel or back yard. His loyalty and alertness often make for a good watchdog. At heart, the Samoyed is still a hunter. He is likely to chase after small animals that he perceives as prey. For his safety, he should always be leashed when he"s not at home in his fenced yard. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Samoyed needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Samoyed puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Samoyeds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Samoyeds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Samoyeds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Samoyed Hereditary Ghlomerulopathy: This is a genetic disease of the kidney. The condition is more severe in males who appear healthy for the first three months of life until symptoms appear. Death from renal failure usually occurs by 15 months of age. Females develop mild symptoms at 2 to 3 months of age, but do not suffer renal failure. To date, there is no genetic screening test available for Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy, but research is ongoing. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): DM is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. A diabetic dog will exhibit a healthy appetite, but will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This is a heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Ask your vet about detecting it and prescribing the proper treatment. Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.
The active Samoyed is not suited to apartment or condo life. A home with a large, securely fenced yard is the best choice. Because the Samoyed is a working dog, he needs room to romp and play. Keep him mentally challenged with ongoing training and dog sports. Allow him to become bored and he"s likely to dig, escape, or chew to entertain himself. Note: The Samoyed should be kept on leash whenever he"s in public; he seldom can resist the lure of small, scurrying animals. With his Nordic heritage, the Samoyed is a natural fit for cold climates, and he loves to play in the snow. Conversely, with his thick coat, he can be sensitive to heat. Do not allow him to exercise strenuously when it is extremely hot — limit high-level activity to early morning or evening when it"s cooler. During the heat of the day, keep your Sammy inside with fans or air conditioning. You"ll need to take special care if you"re raising a Samoyed puppy. Like many large breed dogs, the Samoyed grows rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. Additionally, don"t let your Samoyed puppy run and play on hard surfaces (such as pavement), jump excessively, or pull heavy loads until he is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes with one-inch high jumps. Another important step in training a Samoyed puppy is socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people). Like any dog, he can become timid if he is not properly socialized and exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when he"s young. Formal puppy and obedience classes are also recommended to teach the Samoyed proper canine manners.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Samoyed puppies need slow, steady growth. Feed a good-quality diet with 22 to 24 percent protein, and 12 to 15 percent fat. Keep your Samoyed in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Samoyed, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Samoyed has a straight outer coat and a soft, thick undercoat (often referred to as wool). It can be pure white, white and biscuit, cream, or biscuit — and sheds heavily. Maintenance can be daunting. Daily brushing is necessary when the coat is shedding; once or twice a week when it"s not. He"ll need bathing about once every eight weeks, or whenever he rolls in mud or something smelly (very likely). Bathing the Samoyed is a time-commitment too, as thoroughly soaking the coat, rinsing out the shampoo, and letting it dry completely is no quick process. Many owners opt to hire a professional groomer for their Samoyed. Though costly, it helps to take some burden off the owner. However, you still need to brush regularly. Brush your Samoyed"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Samoyed to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Samoyed is deeply attached to his family, and this certainly includes children. A properly socialized Sammy truly enjoys the attention and company of youngsters if they are instructed on how to treat the dog with care and respect. Due to his size and strength, a Samoyed can easily knock over a small child without even being aware of what has happened, so a responsible adult should supervise all interactions between kids and canines. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The even-tempered Samoyed also enjoys the company of other dogs. This is especially true if he has been raised with other dogs from an early age. (As in any breed, dogs of the same sex that have not been spayed or neutered may not be as tolerant of one another.) Remember, though, that the Samoyed is hardwired to chase prey. For harmonious coexistence with cats and other animals in his household, training, socialization, and a proper introduction are essential. Following that, close supervision is advised.

As early as the 13th century, nobles hunted with packs of tiny Beagles. Known as "glove Beagles," because they reportedly fit in the palm of a heavy leather hunting glove, they were eventually replaced by the 13-inch and 15-inch Beagles we know today. Some modern-day breeders have attempted to recreate the little hounds, resulting in dogs that are referred to as mini Beagles or olde English pocket Beagles. Whatever his size, it"s difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle"s dark brown or hazel eyes, with their soft, pleading expression. These are happy, outgoing, and loving dogs, characteristics that help balance their inquisitive, determined, and food-focused hound nature. They aren"t yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl and a half-baying howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization is usually reserved for when they catch sight of quarry, or decide to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well with other animals and their human friends and are inclined to think everyone is their new best friend. The most important thing to know about any size Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his anatomy, and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once famously described his in-laws" Beagle as "a nose with feet." All Beagles of any size need frequent daily walks or active play periods. Expect to give a pocket Beagle at least an hour of exercise daily. And be warned that this isn"t a breed that walks briskly. Beagles mosey, nose to the ground, sniffing out everything around them. Beagles who are left alone and infrequently exercised become destructive. Just because they"re small doesn"t mean they can"t do a number on your décor.
Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate-training is absolutely recommended. Beagles are very intelligent and can get bored if left alone too long. If left outside alone in a backyard, Beagles usually will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to find ways to get out and find some people or other dogs to play with. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling. The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners" neighbors got tired of their baying. Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and then perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped! Beagles are scenthounds and will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world. Although loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist). Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are "chow hounds" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best. Teach children to respect your Beagle while he"s eating, and not to approach or tease him with food. A Beagle takes his food bowl pretty seriously. Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they"re usually friendly to everyone they meet.
The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain. It"s thought that it may have been derived from the French word begueule, meaning open throat, or from the Old English word beag, meaning small. Others think it may have come from the French word beugler, meaning to bellow, or the German word begele, meaning to scold. The breed"s history is cloudy as well because breeds as we know them today didn"t really develop until the 19th century. But Greek documents from 400 B.C. describe Beagle-like dogs, and the Romans may have brought small rabbit-hunting hounds with them to England and bred them with the local hounds. William the Conqueror reportedly brought Talbot hounds (now extinct) to England during the Norman Conquest in 1066. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the Beagle and the Foxhound. Beagles became popular in England early in its history. During the reigns of Edward II (1307 AD - 1327 AD) and Henry VII (1485 AD - 1509 AD), extremely small beagles, called Glove Beagles — small enough to be held in a gloved hand — were popular. There"s also mention of Singing Beagles, named for their bugling voices. Elizabeth I (1533-1603) kept packs of Pocket Beagles who stood only 9 inches tall. These small dogs were depicted in paintings as short-legged and pointy nosed. They were used for hunting, but quickly fell out of favor because they weren"t very fast. In the 1700s, fox hunting became popular in England, and the Beagle was supplanted by the larger Foxhound. If it hadn"t been for the farmers in England, Ireland, and Wales who continued to keep packs to hunt rabbit and hare, the breed might have become extinct at that time. In the mid-1800s Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a pack of Beagles in Essex, England. These dogs are thought to be the ancestors of the modern Beagle. Rev. Honeywood bred for hunting skills, not looks. Thomas Johnson, a fellow Englishman, was responsible for breeding Beagles that were both attractive and good hunters. At about the same time, American breeders started importing Beagles from England to improve the looks of their own dogs. Many of the English imports were bred to an average height of 15 to 17 inches at the shoulder so they could hunt fox. American breeders started breeding them to be smaller for rabbit hunting. Of interest among these rabbit-hunters is the "Patch" Beagle strain, which was developed by Willet Randall in New York around 1880. The line is primarily white with a very large tri-colored spot. They were very popular in the 1940s and 1950s because they were able to run so fast. Today, many people call lemon and white or red and white beagles "Patch" beagles. The American Kennel Club and the first Beagle specialty club both were founded in 1884. In that same year, the AKC began registering Beagles. Beagles compete in one of two different height classes: Beagles 13 inches tall and under compete in the 13 inch class and Beagles between 13 and 15 inches tall compete in the 15 inch class. The American Kennel Club does not recognize a variety called the Pocket Beagle. Technically, the Pocket Beagle qualifies as a 13-inch Beagle, which is defined by the Beagle breed standard as any Beagle that doesn"t exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder and typically weighs 15 to 18 pounds.
Breeders of Pocket Beagles put their height at 7 to 12 inches and weight at 7 to 15 pounds.
Beagles are gentle and sweet, smart and funny. They will make you laugh — that is when they"re not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and are often forced to resort to food rewards to lure their hounds into a state of temporary obedience. As with every dog, Beagles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your pocket Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
As with all dog breeds, the Beagle is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions, and Pocket Beagles have more than most. While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Beagles, it is imperative to do your research to find a Beagle who"s been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she"s taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy"s parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, knees, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. So look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Pocket Beagles: Eye disorders including cherry eye, a common condition in which the gland of the third eyelid swells; glaucoma, an increase in the pressure of the fluid inside of the eye; cataracts, a clouded film over the eye lens; retinal dysplasia, a folding or displacement of the retina that can lead to blindness; and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells, which progresses to blindness. Beagles also can suffer from Distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing. Epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures, is fairly common in Beagles. Hypothyroidism, a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues, also is common in the breed. Beagle Dwarfism, which means the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs. Funny Puppy syndrome is a condition where a puppy is much smaller than its littermates and may require special feedings and treatments to survive. They often exhibit soreness in their feet and legs and may not be able to walk normally. Sometimes, these puppies grow up to be sickly dogs, but sometimes they show no signs of problems when mature. Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS) is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities. Cleft Lip or Palate: The lip or palate isn"t completely closed, causing the dog to have difficulty eating, drinking, and breathing. Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testicles to descend from the abdomen. When you have your dog neutered, your vet will be able to remove the undescended testicles, thereby helping your dog avoid health problems that might arise from this condition. Hermaphroditism, the presence of both male and female chromosomes and tissue. Canine Hip Dysplasia, an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Epiphyseal Dysplasia, characterized by abnormally slow growth in the rear legs; sometimes causes soreness. Intervertebral Disc DiseaseI (IDD): Ruptured discs in the spine cause pain and paralysis. Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. Patellar luxation ranges from a minor annoyance that causes little pain to a cripping defect.
A pocket Beagle is every bit as much a scenthound as his larger brethren, which means that when outside he should always be on a leash in unconfined areas. He"s a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he"s microchipped and wearing I.D. tags so he can be returned to you. Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn"t prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it. Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply tune out when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat. Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love going for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have adequately trained your dog to come back to you!). They can enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they are 18 months or older before starting them on such a repetitive exercise, or they could experience joint damage. When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, and getting up mostly for meals and an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed is prone to obesity, it"s not a good idea to let this happen.
Recommended daily amount: 7/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they"re willing to eat until they pop. To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Beagle at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your pocket Beagle will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The breed standard for Beagles says any hound color is acceptable. Hound colors include all shades and combinations of white or cream, black, tan, lemon, red, brown, liver, blue, and gray. The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle. The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs, and tip of the tail. All colors can have freckling, mottling (dark roundish blotches on a lighter background), ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), and grizzling (a mixture of black or red and white hairs). Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they"re hunting in tall grass. Although you and I might think a Beagle has a short coat, it"s actually classified as medium length. It"s also smooth, dense, and resistant to rain. Beagles are clean dogs, unless, of course, they"ve found something appealingly stinky to roll in. Otherwise, they don"t require frequent baths. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth. Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it usually isn"t as noticeable as with other breeds. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring. Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn"t circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections, so don"t allow water or oils to enter his ears. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears. You should check your Beagle"s nails once a week and trim them if they are getting long.
Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children. In addition, Beagles tend to be "mouthy," grabbing things, like a child"s hand, with their mouths. They are doing this in fun and can be taught not to do this. Pocket beagles are small and can be easily injured. Make it a rule that young children can hold them only while sitting on the floor. That helps ensure that the dog doesn"t get dropped or carried around like a rag doll. It"s also important never to leave dogs and young children together without supervision. They can hurt each other without meaning to. Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don"t like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.

The Pointer is instantly recognizable. From long head to finely pointed tail, his entire body suggests his purpose: to point game for the hunter. When a Pointer scents game birds he stands tall and still, one foot raised off the ground, pointing the hunter in the right direction. Before the development of guns, this was an essential skill, as birds were netted rather than shot. When shooting birds became popular, the Pointer was still needed to point and then retrieve them. Today, the Pointer is known as the Cadillac of bird dogs, prized for his speed, ability to go all day in the field, "stand steady to wing and shot" — meaning that he holds his position as birds rise into the sky and the guns go off — and his personable nature. His love of people and short, easy-care coat make him an excellent candidate as family companion as well. Pointer people like to say that their dogs don"t consider themselves dogs but members of the family. They"re sturdy and energetic enough to play all day with active children, and their alert nature makes them excellent watchdogs, sounding the alarm at anything out of the ordinary. Although he"s focused in the field — full of energy and "hunt" — he"s fun-loving and mischievous at home. For the Pointer who"s not a regular hunting dog, training and plenty of daily exercise will help channel his active body and mind into constructive pursuits rather than the destruction that can be wrought by a bored Pointer. Thanks to his sporting dog heritage, the Pointer runs hard and fast and is a super companion for a runner or cyclist. His competitive nature also makes the Pointer a natural at dog sports such as field trials, obedience, rally, and agility. This is a dog who loves to perform in public. His flashy looks and love of attention make him an excellent show dog as well. It"s clear that the Pointer has many wonderful attributes as a companion. That said, he can be overwhelming for older or first-time dog owners. Know what you"re getting when you bring a Pointer home: he needs consistent, ongoing training and an hour or two a day of play, walks, or other exercise — the more active the better. When all those things are in place, he"s a loyal and true friend.
Pointers are very active and require vigorous exercise every day. If you do not have the time or energy to exercise your Pointer at least one hour each day, then you should not purchase a Pointer. Pointers can be very destructive when they are bored or don"t get enough exercise, especially when young. This can result in chewing, digging, and many other negative behaviors that can lead to expensive vet bills and replacement costs. Pointers are wonderful family dogs who thrive when they can spend time with their people. A Pointer should not live outdoors but should enjoy the same comforts as his family. Although Pointers do very well with children, especially when raised with them, they are not best suited for homes with toddlers. They can be rambunctious as puppies and can unintentionally hurt small children by knocking them down or swiping them with that wagging tail. Pointers are not suited for apartment dwellings; they do much better in homes with a large fenced yard where they can expend some of their energy. Pointers generally do well with other dogs and other pets, especially if they"re raised with them. They may, however, be very interested in pet birds, and the two should be protected from each other. You don"t want your Pointer injured by a parrot"s beak, and you don"t want him trying to retrieve your parrot, canary or finch. Pointers are strong and energetic with a mind of their own. They"re not a good choice for first-time dog owners or people who aren"t strong enough to handle them and give them the exercise they need. Training is a must with this breed because he has a will of his own. Training can take time, but once the foundation is there, there is no limit to how far Pointers can go in various dog competitions. Pointers are average shedders and require only minimal grooming. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Pointer was a term used to describe any breed of hunting dog that pointed at the game it was hunting. They are believed to have originated in Spain, although, like most breeds, their history is somewhat murky. Pointing-type dogs are said to have been known in England as early as 1650, but it"s also thought that English officers brought Spanish Pointers back from the Netherlands — which was then under Spanish control — in 1713 after participating in the War of the Spanish Succession. The Spanish Pointers were larger, heavier, slower dogs than the Pointer we know today, but their strong point — so to speak — was their pointing instinct, and they were used to strengthen that feature in the British dogs. The modern Pointer"s appearance was developed in England, probably through crosses with the Foxhound, Greyhound, Bloodhound, and later, various setters. Hunters hoped to b

Affectionately known as the "Royal Dog of Scotland," it is not difficult to imagine how this breed, with its athletic, well-muscled build, came by the title. The Scottish Deerhound has a romantic past, a noble bearing, and a loving nature, so much so that Sir Walter Scott — himself the owner of deerhound named Maida — described the breed as "the most perfect creature of Heaven." What is the allure of this large dog, with his wiry coat and greyhound-type build? Much of it can"t be answered in words but must be witnessed firsthand. The Scottish Deerhound is affectionate toward everyone — family, friends, and strangers alike. He loves children and usually does well with other dogs, although the larger the better. With his long legs, he enjoys a nice jog with a human companion, but afterward is happy to laze around on the sofa and snooze in a sunny spot. This gentle dog has an elegant and polite air but is never aloof. While he"s undoubtedly loyal and courageous, he doesn"t make the best watchdog. His size might be intimidating to someone who doesn"t know him, but he"s too loving and friendly to pose any threat, and it rarely occurs to him to bark when someone approaches his home. He"s highly active as a puppy, but by the time he"s 3 to 5 years old he morphs into a couch potato. Nonetheless, he still requires long walks daily to maintain his tall, gangly body. The Scottish Deerhound is kind enough for people who are inexperienced with dogs, but even a novice should understand that he"s not the easiest breed to train. Deerhounds are lazy and approach training with a "What"s in it for me?" attitude. Although they have a reputation for not doing well in obedience or agility competitions, they can succeed in these arenas if their trainers are willing to put in hard work and consistent training. Scottish Deerhounds may also be slower than other breeds when it comes to housetraining, but the same patience and consistency that gives you a well-trained dog will be an asset with this step in training. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living despite their calm indoor nature. They do best when they have a large yard to run in, and the yard should be fenced to prevent them from chasing "prey" into the street. Underground electronic fencing should not be used with this breed; no shock will stop them once they go into chase mode. They"re best suited to homes without cats or other small pets that may trigger their prey drive. If you can meet the special needs of a giant breed built for speed, the Scottish Deerhound is a devoted companion who will fill your life with all the love his large and dignified heart can give.
Scottish Deerhounds need a securely fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey. Underground electronic fencing will not prevent them from giving chase. The Scottish Deerhound is not recommended in homes with smaller animals and pets that could be considered as "prey." If they are not properly socialized, and for some Scottish Deerhounds even socialization does not curb it, they will give chase whenever they see the other animal. This could result in the smaller animal being killed or injured. Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels indoors, they are a large dog and require lots of room to run. They require daily exercise and do best in a home with a large yard or acreage. Scottish Deerhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing a moving animal, but be aware that they can and will lift you off your feet if they do decide to take off and you"re hanging on to the leash. The Scottish Deerhound is a very affectionate breed and will generally befriend everyone he meets. He gets along well with other dogs if they are large and don"t trigger his prey drive. He doesn"t make the best alert or guard dog because of his loving nature. Housetraining can take a bit longer with the Scottish Deerhound than with other breeds. Be patient and consistent. Scottish Deerhounds are relatively inactive inside but still need a lot of daily exercise to maintain their huge bodies. They make great jogging companions and enjoy long, long walks. Many people are surprised when their active Scottish Deerhound puppy turns into a couch potato adult. Scottish Deerhounds do very well with older children, but take into account their size and energy level when they"re outdoors. Don"t let a child walk a Scottish Deerhound; he won"t be able to hang onto him if he decides to run after something. Regardless of breed, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The origins of the Scottish Deerhound are lost in the Highland mists. Over the centuries, they"ve been known as Irish wolfdogs, Scottish greyhounds, rough greyhounds, and Highland deerhounds. Whether they were originally used to hunt wolves and then repurposed to hunt the great stags of the Highlands is unknown, but we do know that they were used as far back as the 16th century to hunt and bring down deer. The deerhounds were highly regarded for their courage and gentle dignity. A nobleman condemned to death could purchase his life with a gift of deerhounds. And only a nobleman could do so; no one beneath the rank of earl could lay claim to a deerhound, which was commonly known as the Royal Dog of Scotland. The breed suffered under its restricted ownership, however, and there were many times it came close to extinction, most nearly when the clan system of Scotland collapsed in 1745 after the fateful battle of Culloden during the Jacobite rebellion against English rule. By 1769 the breed was in dire straits. Efforts were made to restore the breed to its original glory in the 1820s by Archibald and Duncan McNeill. The breed made its way to America as well. The first Scottish Deerhound registered by the American Kennel Club was Bonnie Robin in 1886. During World War I, the breed suffered another decline in numbers when many large estates in Scotland and England were broken up. The Scottish Deerhound became a rare breed again, enjoyed only by a select few. Today the Scottish Deerhound is still a fairly uncommon breed, appreciated by those who love sighthounds or have an interest because of their Scottish heritage, but more are coming to learn that this is a versatile breed and an all-around exceptional dog. Today the Scottish Deerhound ranks 135th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
The average height for a Scottish Deerhound is 30 to 32 inches for a male and from 28 inches and up for a female. Males weigh 85 to 110 pounds, females 75 to 95 pounds.
The Scottish Deerhound can best be described as chivalrous. He"s gentle yet strong, sensitive yet brave. Loyal, devoted, quiet, dignified, and alert are all terms that apply to this dog. He is courageous in the face of danger but never aggressive. Of course, those characteristics don"t just appear. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Scottish Deerhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Deerhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Scottish Deerhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Deerhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Deerhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website. Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Scottish Deerhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is believed to be related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of a Scottish Deerhound is generally too high a dose for the low-body-fat Deerhound. It is important to choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds and will be aware of how to dose your Scottish Deerhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, take the time to alert them to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time. Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It"s identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred. Osteosarcoma: Most often affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is a lameness in the limb, but the dog will require x-rays to determine the cause. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. Factor VII Deficiency: Factor VII deficiency causes excessive and sometimes fatal bleeding from minor wounds and surgery. A DNA test to identify carriers of Factor VII deficiency is available. This genetic abnormality is present at birth and doesn"t change, so a test at any age is accurate for the dog"s entire life. Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they"re fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Deerhounds are especially prone to inhalant allergies. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.
Scottish Deerhounds are calm and sedate. They enjoy a good run or a long walk, but in the main they"re more mellow than manic. They"ll enjoy any game that involves chasing something, although you shouldn"t expect them to bring it back. Because they"re a giant breed, it"s important to introduce puppies to exercise gradually so you don"t damage their still developing bones and joints. Deerhound puppies need plenty of off-leash exercise in a safely fenced area to develop properly. Give them unrestricted access to a large yard so they can get out and run when the mood strikes them. Start them on walks when they"re 8 weeks old and gradually work them up to a mile or more by the time they"re 12 weeks old. By 6 months of age, they"ll be capable and desirous of much longer walks. They should be two years old before they begin any type of jumping or running. Avoid exercising them on hard surfaces such as concrete as much as possible. In the house, they need a puppy-proofed room where they can stretch out and play, yet not do too much damage. When you"re not there to supervise, confine them to it with a tall dog gate or baby gate. Long hours in a crate can damage their joints. Scottish Deerhounds are not the easiest of breeds to train and require patience and understanding. They enjoy the attention they receive when you"re happy with their behavior, but all in all they"d rather do what they like. They are sensitive and won"t respond to harsh treatment. Positive reinforcement with food rewards, praise, and play is the best training technique to use with this breed, and it"s important to be consistent. With a trainer who"s patient and has a sense of humor, they"ve been known to achieve advanced titles in obedience. Leash training is a must with the Scottish Deerhound. Your Scottish Deerhound must be leashed on walks or his prey drive will kick in when he sees a small animal in motion. Once that happens, nothing will matter to him but the chase, no matter how many frantic commands you shout. While it"s breathtaking to see a Deerhound in action, it"s heartbreaking if he becomes injured in the chase, hurts or kills the animal he"s pursuing, or runs in front of a car and is killed. If you want to see him run and chase, get him involved in lure coursing.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. If you"re unsure whether your Deerhound"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Deerhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The thick coat of a Scottish Deerhound is 3 to 4 inches long, harsh and wiry, meant to protect the dog as he hunted the rough terrain of the Scottish Highlands. In contrast, the hair on the head, belly, and breast is usually quite soft. A slight fringe of hair — not enough to be called feathering — adorns the backs of the legs. Climate affects the texture of the coat, and in the United States Deerhounds commonly have a coat that is a mix of wiry and silky hair. No self-respecting Deerhound has a woolly coat, however, which doesn"t shed dirt the way the wiry coat does. The typical Deerhound wears a coat of dark blue-gray, but the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look — says he also comes in dark gray, brindle, light gray, red fawn, sandy red, or yellow. The latter three colors are especially attractive when the dog has a black muzzle and ears, but it"s unlikely you"ll ever see it. Most Deerhounds come in only three colors: gray, gray, and gray. Once in a while you"ll see a bit of white on the chest or toes, but the less white the better. Scottish Deerhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush the coat with a wire slicker brush once or twice a week to remove dead hair, stimulate the circulation, and distribute natural skin oils. Always brush in the direction the hair grows. Give a final going over with a metal comb — known as a greyhound comb — to be sure you haven"t missed any tangles. You can also use the comb on the softer belly, chest, and facial hair. Using your fingers, gently pluck any long or light-colored hairs from the ears until they look velvety black. Bathe your Deerhound as needed to remove any dust, dirt, or doggy odor that"s developed. A bath will temporarily make his coat feel soft, but it will regain its crisp feel in a few days. With regular brushing, he really shouldn"t need a bath more than a couple of times a year unless you"re showing him. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Deerhound"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog"s feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Deerhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Because your Deerhound has floppy ears, you should check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Deerhound may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear. Begin accustoming your Deerhound to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult — essential with a dog this size. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Deerhounds can get along with children, but they"re not really a playmate kind of dog, being more into body slams than playing fetch. They"re best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Deerhounds aren"t best pleased by the poking, prodding, and pulling of toddlers and will generally stalk off rather than put up with it. Their size also makes them unsuited to life with small children; they can easily knock them over without meaning to. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. While your Deerhound may learn to live peaceably with small dogs or cats indoors, if he sees them running around outdoors it can be a different story.

As the gruff friend of an animated cocker spaniel, who portrayed loyalty and protectiveness when he told an equally animated Tramp to take a walk without the Lady, the Scottish Terrier Jock evoked an image that generations of children have enjoyed. Disney"s Lady and the Tramp is a time-cherished animated movie that caused many people to fall in love with the Scottie. Stoic and aristocratic, he is easily recognized and is plastered on everything that can be decorated, including clothing, photographs, pictures, cards, and ornaments.This short-legged wonder was originally bred to hunt prey such as badgers and foxes, and he has therefore developed into a self-directed and opinionated companion. His independence and intelligence have drawn many dog lovers to the breed, but others find the Scottie"s aloofness less than endearing. He doesn"t naturally trust strangers (so he needs proper socialization as a puppy), and he"ll take his own sweet time figuring out a situation or person. But if he decides to befriend you, it will be for life. Too smart to forget anything, the Scottie is also brave and loyal.He likes all living arrangements but needs a short daily walk if you"re in an apartment. He loves family companionship and is gentle and playful with children, and he"s considerate of the elderly. Although he loves youngsters, he"s not suited for homes with babies and toddlers, because it"s the Scottie"s nature to stand up for himself when prodded and pulled. That can translate into a bite.A Scottie enjoys digging holes throughout your backyard, and he doesn"t grasp that you might not like it. He will chase "prey" out of yards right into traffic, so a fence is a necessity (those electronic ones won"t cut it; he"ll just charge right through them). He"ll rid your yard of any squirrels or other vermin.Although many terriers are known as yappy, the Scottish Terrier is not. His style is a loud alert bark. Some Scotties know the difference between steps made by a friend or steps made by a stranger, only giving the alert if it"s the latter.Scottish Terriers can be difficult to train because they were bred to work apart from their owner, without needing direction. A Scottie won"t stop and ask you what to do next but will do it on his own. That"s why Scotties generally don"t score high in obedience rallies (they"re better suited to agility), although there are exceptions. This isn"t to say that he"s untrainable, but rather that his temperament is suited to working separately from his owners, as he often sets his own course. He doesn"t do well with aggressive training, as he has a kind heart that can be broken easily if he perceives mistreatment. He thrives on positive reinforcement.Today the Scottish Terrier enjoys the title of family dog, but he is in essence a working dog and is much happier with a job to do, even if it"s just simple tricks. Historically, the Scottie was bred by farmers to help them manage vermin problems. He would follow prey, such as badgers, foxes, and other vermin, right into their burrows and then try to dig them out. Such breeds of dogs are known as Earth dogs. Scottish Terriers do well in earthdog trials, which are a simulated hunt.The breed"s stubbornness often translates into bravery. In the nineteenth century a military man, George the fourth Earl of Dumbarton, had a famous pack of Scotties. These dogs were so brave in battle that they were nicknamed "diehards." George"s regiment, the Royal Scots, were called "Dumbarton"s Diehards" after the dogs. Today that bravery has a different application in home protection, but the nature of it hasn"t changed.There are Scottish Terriers that can be hardheaded, serious, energetic, and introverted — and some that can be sweet, playful, placid, and tolerant of everyone. They have been loved by many, including Shirley Temple, Franklin Roosevelt, and George W. Bush; even Hitler got two Scottish Terriers for his fiancé, Eva Braun.There is no denying that this brave and jaunty little aristocrat of the dog world is loved, respected, and adored for all his idiosyncrasies. Having a dog that is more partner than servant can be a wonderful experience — but it"s not for everyone. If you prefer a dog that is eager to please, think twice about living with a Scottish Terrier.
Originally bred for hunting and following prey to ground, the Scottish Terrier is designed to dig, and he still has that drive today. It"s better to find a designated digging area in your backyard then fight an active and natural instinct. Scottish Terriers tend to be aloof with strangers and can be aggressive to other dogs if they are not properly socialized when young. Scotties are not low-energy small dogs. They were bred as working dogs and have lots of drive and intelligence that needs to be channelled. They need daily moderate exercise and stimulation. If you"re looking for a dog that"s happier sitting at your side then digging holes in your backyard, a Scottie might not be for you. Although Scottish Terriers enjoy exercise, they are not recommended as jogging companions. With his short legs, a short walk around your block can feel like a long-distance marathon to the Scottish Terrier. Behind German Shepherds and Rottweilers, Scotties have been ranked third in alarm barking. They will bark at strangers and are not the ideal pet in a dwelling or area that has noise rules. A Scottie should have a physical fence around his yard, not an electronic one. It keeps him from chasing cats, squirrels, bikes, and other moving objects out onto the street. He should be leashed on walks, because with his chase instinct, he"s likely to run off after an animal or smell. The Scottie isn"t suited for homes with young infants and toddlers. He"s been known to defend himself against unwanted pulling and prodding. He sheds only lightly but requires significant grooming. The coat takes time to maintain, with grooming weekly or daily in the case of show dogs. It should be clipped several times a year. In terms of his size and exercise needs, the Scottie is adaptable to various types of dwellings, including apartments. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
Despite being an old breed, the Scottish Terrier"s history is somewhat obscure and undocumented. The Scottie"s origin is believed to date back to a dog that was described by Pliny the Elder in 55 B.C. When the Romans invaded Britain, he wrote, "They found, much to their surprise, small dogs that would follow their quarry to the ground." The Romans called the dogs terrarii, which means "workers of the earth" and is derived from terra, the Latin word for earth. The Scottish Terrier was a hunter and still hunts by instinct today.The Old Scotch Terrier is believed to be one of the oldest breeds in Scotland and the foundation dog for all of today"s terrier breeds. The breed is extinct today but was described as a stable worker with strength, courage, and stamina, who could breach his quarry"s rocky dens. The breed was a black or sandy-colored dog that was low in stature, strong, with long hair and small, half-prick ears.If we fast-forward from the first few centuries to 1436, we find a description, in Don Leslie"s book A History of Scotland, of a small dog similar in form to the Scottish Terrier. By the early 1800s, many writers wrote of two separate terrier breeds in Britain, the Scottish Terrier (distinguished by its rough hair) and the English Terrier (identified by its smooth hair).Somewhat earlier, in the seventeenth century, James I of England sent several dogs to France as a present to the French monarch. Those dogs are believed to have been foundation dogs for the modern Scottish Terrier. The king"s love of the breed helped to increase its popularity, which rose over the next three centuries.During the 1800s, Scotland had many terriers. By the end of the century, the dogs had been separated into two different groups, the Dandie Dinmont Terriers and the Skye Terriers (although the latter was a fairly generic name given to all terriers that came from the Isle of Skye). The Scottish Terrier was grouped under the Skye Terriers and shown under that class in the show ring until the 1870s. At that time, the standard for the Scottish Terrier was written and, by the end of the nineteenth century, the Skye Terriers had been divided into the four different breeds we know today: the Scottish Terrier, Skye Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, and the Cairn Terrier.
The Scottish Terrier is a small, short-legged dog with a compact and sturdy build. The average height is 10 inches. The weight ranges from 19 to 22 pounds for a male and 18 to 21 pounds for a female.
The Scottish Terrier"s character and personality are a bit like the lonely moors of his homeland. He"s a serious guy, not particularly jolly, and he approves of dignity and reserve. He"s opinionated, as well as independent and smart as a whip. He tends to be aloof (but not toward his family). A Scottie doesn"t respond much to people who oooh and ahh over him while he"s out and about. He"s slow to accept anyone outside the family, but his devotion to his own people is legendary. He needs to live inside the house, because companionship is his mainstay. Sensitive to praise and anger, he"s good at adapting to the changing moods of a household. When you"re quiet, he"ll be quiet (unless he sees a squirrel); when you"re ready for a walk, he"ll bound outdoors with you.Remember his background: he"s a true terrier. If another dog provokes him, he"ll fight to the end. If other dogs leave him alone, he leaves them alone.It"s important, actually critical, to take your Scottie to socialization classes starting when he"s a puppy. Inviting friends and family over or going to busy places with him while he"s young will tamp down his general distrust of strangers. Left unchecked, that can translate into aggression when the dog is an adult — so start training your Scottie puppy from the moment you bring him home.
Scottish Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they"re prone to certain conditions and diseases. Scottie cramp is a common disorder in Scottish Terriers and is considered harmless to the breed. The symptoms of Scottie cramp occur only when the dog is stressed or overstimulated, such as during exercise, mating, or fights. The dog will appear normal at rest but will exhibit an arching of the spine, overflexing of the rear legs, the front legs may move outward from side to side, and the dog may show a goose-stepping gait. Some dogs may temporarily loose their ability to walk or run, and those who are severely affected may have trouble walking or running when stressed. This is not a progressive disease, and Scottish Terriers live long and healthy lives with this disorder. Treatment is not necessary, but in some severe cases it has been treated with vitamin E, diazepam, or Prozac. Von Willebrand"s disease is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition when he"s a puppy. Dogs with this condition should not be bred. Craniomandibular osteopathy affects several skull bones. While a puppy is growing, the skull bones become irregularly enlarged. The symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. Often the puppy"s jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won"t be able to open his mouth. He"ll drool, have a fluctuating fever every couple of weeks, and in some cases the chewing muscles may atrophy. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. There is no treatment, but anti-inflammatories and pain relievers ease the discomfort. Proper nutrition is necessary, and in severe cases a feeding tube may be needed. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent problems with using the jaw and eating. In some cases, there can be a permanent inability to move the jaw; surgery can partially correct that. Patellar luxation is a common problem in small dogs, including Scotties. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation refers to dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). In patellar luxation, the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling. The treatment is surgery.
The Scottie is active and can become destructive when bored and underexercised. He loves to go for walks, but running is not part of his plan for the day. He has to be leashed for walks because he is a hunter, after all, and he will see the squirrel but not the car.He likes water but can"t swim, and that"s a bad conflict. He"ll sink like a stone because of his short legs and heavy body. Scotties and uncovered swimming pools are a disaster waiting to happen, which is why Scottie Rescue groups prefer not to place them in homes with pools.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Scottie doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Scottie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Scottie in a crate all day long, however. Scotties are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Scottish, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
While many people think of them as black, Scottish Terriers can also be grey or steel, brindle, or wheaten. The wheaten ones look a bit like West Highland White Terriers, which isn"t surprising given their intertwined history.The Scottish Terrier has two coats. The topcoat, or overcoat, should be hard and wiry; the bottom coat, or undercoat, should be soft and dense. Because his hair just keeps growing, he doesn"t shed as much as short-coated breeds. Scotty skin dries out quickly, so don"t bathe until necessary.Many believe that the Scottish Terrier is easy to maintain, but in reality the breed needs a great deal of grooming. Set up a grooming table to bring the dog up to your level if that makes it easier for you. The coat needs to be groomed weekly for a pet and daily for a show dog.A variety of tools are used for brushing a Scottish Terrier: a stiff brush, a hound glove, a wide-toothed comb for the beard, and scissors for trimming. Show dogs are groomed with a technique called stripping, in which loose hairs are pulled out. It can be done with stripping knives or by hand, and the hair should always be stripped with the lay of the hair.Your Scottish Terrier should be clipped every two months if your aim is to keep his hair short; you can do it yourself or go to a groomer. If you are keeping the hair long, trim several times a year. A Scottish Terrier whose coat gets clipped regularly has softer hair (not preferred in the breed standard) and a duller coat color. If you plan to show your Scottie in conformation, avoid clipping as it is difficult to get the hair back into the proper standard condition.Scotties have bad reactions to fleas and have been known to chew themselves bald. Brushing regularly and using a flea comb are good ideas, combined with today"s preventives. Begin accustoming your Scottie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Trim nails regularly if he doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long.Brush your Scottie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Scottish Terriers have large teeth that are close together, which is why his teeth should be cleaned frequently. If the teeth aren"t cleaned, the dog can suffer from tooth decay and gum disease.Start grooming when your dog is young, and make it a positive experience filled with praise and rewards to lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
He"s so good with children that he"s been called a nanny — but, like any terrier, the Scottie will react poorly to his tail or hair being pulled, and he"s not well suited to the noise and movements of toddlers and very young children. But with well-behaved children, he"s a champion and he will appoint himself their guardian.A true terrier, he can be aggressive with other dogs, particularly those of the same sex. Although he"s not a sparring dog, if he wants to start a fight or responds to another dog"s challenge, it can be a real problem. He"s fine with those dogs he"s been raised with.Because he"s a hunter, he is not well suited to smaller pets. He may or may not tolerate a cat, but he"s definitely bad news around small mammals such as hamsters or rats. To him, they"re fast-food snacks. It"s hardwired in the Scottie to go after vermin — it"s not a choice. Set him up for success by not putting him in a situation where he has to fight his own nature, because he won"t.

The Pomsky is a designer breed of dog that is a hybrid of the Pomeranian and the Siberian Husky. Adorable Pomsky puppies have attracted a lot of attention recently and made them one of the most popular breeds of 2017. Due to the size difference of the parent dogs, Pomskies are almost always bred by artificial insemination, as natural breeding would be unsafe. This is an expensive process, which means that breeders charge a lot of money for Pomskies.The desire for Pomskies only encourages breeders to meet demand, leaving dogs in shelters without homes. Additionally, many people buy Pomskies because they are cute puppies, but they find themselves unprepared for the responsibility of owning a dog, especially one with the Pomsky"s specific needs. Backyard breeders also take advantage of Pomsky mania by cranking out puppies and selling them cheaply to buyers without guaranteeing health or breed purity. Be wary of those offering cheap or free Pomsky puppies and consider adopting from a shelter or rescue instead. Several Pomskies have ended up in shelters or with rescues because people give them up when they realize they aren"t ready to meet a Pomsky"s needs, so it shouldn"t be too long before you find one available for adoption.
The Pomsky"s thick coat makes it more tolerant of cold weather than most other kinds of lap dogs. Pomskies are highly adaptable, don"t have large space requirements, and only have moderate exercise needs, making them good apartment dogs. The coat of the breed comes in a variety of colors, just like its parent breeds. Pomskies are vocal dogs that tend to be yappy if they aren"t properly trained. Socialization with other dogs and people is important, especially at an early age. Pomskies are very trainable, but may inherit some stubbornness from the Siberian Husky, so they are best suited for experienced dog owners.
The history of the Pomsky dog breed isn"t a long one, mostly because the breed was recently designed and created through artificial insemination. Since the breed is so new, most standards of how it should look or traits that it should have still haven"t been established. It will take several more years and generations of dogs before the breed is recognized and standards are formed. The Pomsky Club of America is one group that is working to get the breed officially recognized, though dogs will have to be bred for specific, consistent traits before this can happen. At this time, Pomskies can vary greatly in looks and temperament, even within the same litter, so breed standards aren"t likely to come any time soon.If you are interested in getting a Pomsky, there is no reason you have to rely on a breeder of designer dogs. Keep an eye on shelters near you, and you can take a look at Pomeranian and Siberian Husky rescue groups, as they sometimes try to find homes for mixes of those breeds. You can also check our searchable database of adoptable dogs to find a breed you like. Even if you don"t see exactly what you"re looking for, there are plenty of other dogs for you to fall in love with.
The Pomsky is a small to mid-sized dog that falls somewhere between the breed"s Pomeranian and Siberian Husky parents in size. There is some variation in size, as breed standards haven"t been firmly established, but it"s fairly safe to assume that a Pomsky won"t be much heavier than 38 pounds at most when it is full-grown, and that"s on the higher end of Pomsky weight.
The Pomsky is a bit of a comedian and tends to know that its cute antics will be met with plenty of adoration from human onlookers. They are highly adaptable to change, and their moderate exercise needs make them fairly suited to apartment living, so long as they get at least one long walk per day. That said, they tend to inherit their Husky parents" chatty howling and whining tendencies along with their Pomeranian parents" penchant for yapping. This makes them very vocal dogs that may get on the neighbors" nerves. Also, they shed a ton, so be prepared to find hair everywhere and have some lint rollers and a vacuum cleaner at the ready.Pomskies tend to latch on to one favorite family member, though they may get along with all humans in the household. Socialization is very important and should begin at an early age. Pomskies can be nervous around strangers if they haven"t been properly socialized.
Pomskies can develop the common health problems of both its Husky and Pomeranian parents. They are genetically predisposed to conditions like allergies, hip dysplasia, dislocated knees (luxating patellas), eye problems, epilepsy, heart disease, collapsing trachea, and skin problems among other issues. They are also especially prone to dental issues, so it is important to keep up with regular teeth cleanings.
Pomskies have moderate exercise needs that should be satisfied with at least one good walk per day. They can have high energy, and may need some extra play sessions before they relax.Their thick coat makes Pomskies suitable to cold weather, so be prepared to bundle up and take them outdoors all year long. They also do well with toys that stimulate them mentally, as Pomskies are intelligent dogs that may become bored if they aren"t challenged.Training can be tough, as some Pomskies inherit stubbornness from the Siberian Husky, but they should be fine with learning new things if you provide them with food motivators and plenty of praise.
Pomskies are high energy dogs and require a diet that will meet their needs. Because breed standards haven"t been established, it is difficult to say for sure what individual dogs will need to eat. It is best to ask your veterinarian or a pet nutritionist about your specific dog"s nutritional requirements. Typically, they"ll need a diet suitable for a small to mid-sized dog.
Pomskies have a soft, fluffy double coat that requires lots of brushing to maintain. The thick coat keeps them very comfortable in cold temperatures. Pomskies tend to shed a lot, and although brushing helps, you can still expect to find hair around the home. Coat colors vary, much like the breed"s Pomeranian and Husky parents. They come in grey and white, brown or reddish brown, blue, pure white, and more. Nails should be trimmed every few weeks and teeth should be brushed daily, as the breed is prone to dental problems.

Pomskies are often wary of small children who may not be properly trained on how to handle animals, and they can nip if they feel uncomfortable or threatened. They can get along with other dogs if they are socialized, especially if they have been raised with them, though the high prey drive they inherit from the Husky means they might like to give chase to smaller animals like cats. It is best to socialize them early, especially if you plan to have them in a household with children or other pets.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 1 inch to 1 foot, 4 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  Starts at 20 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The small, active Shetland Sheepdog (nicknamed the Sheltie) was once a Scottish farmer"s best friend: sounding the alarm when anyone approached the property, barking at birds and other animals to shoo them from the garden, and later, with crosses to Scottish herding dogs, keeping the sheep flocks in line. While at first glance they look like a smaller version of the Rough Collie, the two are distinctly different breeds. Shelties are loving companions for all members of the family, including the kids, but they can be reserved or even shy around strangers. Because of their protective nature, they"re quick to bark if they sense that anything"s amiss in their territory. Training is essential to keep this trait from becoming a nuisance. On the upside, they make excellent watchdogs. You just have to teach them some discrimination. Ask any Sheltie owner, and they"ll probably tell you how smart their dog is. According to Dr. Stanley Coren, an animal intelligence expert, that"s more than pride of ownership talking. In his studies of the intelligence of 132 different dog breeds, Shelties ranked sixth in intelligence by being able to understand a new command after being told it fewer than five times on average, and obeying commands the first time they were given at least 95 percent of the time. Because of their intelligence, willingness to please, and athletic ability, Shelties excel at performance events. In their size group, Shelties typically dominate the field in agility. They"re also exceptionally good in competitive obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding. In fact, Shelties have a reputation for being a little too smart for their own good. This is a breed that needs a job. Without plenty of mental stimulation, Shelties quickly become bored and will invent their own entertainment, which may or may not be to their people"s liking. Shelties retain a strong herding instinct. You"ll find that your Sheltie will enthusiastically chase and try to "herd" squirrels, rabbits, and children, running around them, barking, and nipping. Shelty owners should discourage this habit, especially with children, because it can lead to biting. Never let your Sheltie herd unless it"s in a herding class with appropriate subjects such as ducks or sheep. Shelties are relatively inactive indoors and can handle apartment living if they"re walked daily and aren"t recreational barkers. Otherwise, they need a fenced yard where they can play safely and be prevented from seeking out animals, people, or cars to "herd." Shelties have a long, dense, furry coat and shed heavily. Lots of people don"t realize just how much loose fur they"re letting themselves in for, and many Shelties are given up to rescue groups every year because they shed. Be sure that you and your vacuum cleaner can handle that much hair. Shelties can be a good choice for a working person as they"ll stay home alone contentedly, provided they get their fair share of attention when their people are home. They thrive in an environment where they"re given companionship, playtime, training, and quiet patting. Your love they"ll return tenfold.
Many Shelties are very vocal, and they have a loud, piercing bark. To keep your relations with neighbors friendly, it"s important to train your Sheltie at an early age to stop barking on command. Expect your Sheltie to shed profusely in the spring, and sometimes at other times in the year. Shelties are extremely intelligent and like to have a job to do. They can be stubborn, however. Make training fun and allow them time to make up their own minds to do what you want them to do. Shelties have a lot of energy and need to be able to run. They thrive on activities such as agility and flyball, where they get both mental and physical exercise. Shelties have been popular family dogs for many years. Because there"s a big demand for puppies, there are many poorly bred Shelties for sale. If you"re looking for a puppy, make sure you find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees.
The Sheltie hails from the rugged Shetland Islands, which lie between Scotland and Norway, about 50 miles north of Scotland and a bit south of the Arctic Circle. These islands are also home to other small breeds of animals, such as Shetland Ponies and Shetland Sheep. For many years, the Shetland Sheepdog was called the Toonie, taken from the Norwegian word for farm. Farmers bred the dogs, crossing the Border Collie with smaller dogs, to herd and protect their flocks of Shetland Sheep. Some speculate that one of the tasks of Shetland Sheepdogs was to protect the small sheep from birds. Indeed, many of today"s Shelties seem to have a passion for chasing birds, and some even try to chase airplanes and helicopters flying overhead. In the early 1800s, the Sheltie was brought to England and Scotland, where he was described as a miniature Collie. On the Shetland Islands, the farmers started breeding their small Shelties to be even smaller and fluffier, so they could sell them to visitors to the islands. It"s rumored that a Prince Charles Spaniel (a variety of English Toy Spaniel) and some Pomeranian dogs, left on the island by tourists, were crossed with the native sheepdogs. There was so much crossbreeding that by the end of the 19th century, islanders realized that the original type of dog was disappearing. There was much dissension about what the original dog had looked like, however, and how to get back to it. Some breeders believed they needed to crossbreed with Collies in order to regain the original type, some felt that they should breed only the existing Shelties who were closest to the original type, and others continued to crossbreed indiscriminately with other breeds to develop small, pretty pets. Shelties of all three types were entered in dog shows in the early 20th century, up to World War I. In 1909, England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed. Altogether, 28 Shelties were registered that year as Shetland Collies (rough). Four of them still appear in the pedigrees of many modern champion Shelties: two males named Lerwick Tim and Trim and two females named Inverness Topsy and Inga. The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was Lord Scott in 1911. Collie breeders in England were unhappy about the name of the breed, however, and protested to the Kennel Club. This led to the change of the name to Shetland Sheepdog. The Shetland Sheepdog stirred up controversy both in Great Britain and the United States for many years, with rumors of crossbreeding and long-running disagreements about what the breed should look like. As a consequence, many Shetland Sheepdog clubs were formed to support the different viewpoints. Finally, in 1930 the Scottish and English Clubs got together and agreed that the dog "should resemble a collie (rough) in miniature." U.S. breeders imported Shelties from England until the 1950"s, but by that time, American and British Shelties had begun to diverge greatly in type and size. Today, almost all Shetland Sheepdogs in the U.S. are descended from dogs that were imported from England between World Wars I and II. As the breed became more well known, its numbers increased in the U.S. In the 1970s, their popularity exploded and Shelties appeared on the American Kennel Club"s list of the ten most popular dogs in 12 of the next 15 years, peaking in the early 1990s. Today the Sheltie ranks 20th in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club. And how is the Sheltie faring in his native Shetland Islands? Ironically, he"s fairly rare in his rugged homeland — the breed has been replaced by the Border Collie.
The Shetland Sheepdog stands between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder, but it"s not unusual for them to be over- or undersize. A typical Sheltie weighs about 22 pounds, but a large one can weigh as much as 35 or 40 pounds.
The Sheltie is intensely loyal, gentle, and sensitive. There"s a wide range of personalities in the breed, from outgoing and boisterous to calm and sedate to shy or retiring. It"s normal for Shelties to be reserved with strangers, but steer clear of dogs that seem overly timid or nervous. If you"re choosing a puppy, it"s fine if they don"t always come right up to a stranger, but they should be happily curious and ready to make friends with someone who sits down on the floor with them. Whatever their personality, Shelties prefer to be with their people at all times and will follow them from room to room during the course of the day. Like all dogs, Shelties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sheltie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Shelties are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shelties will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Shelties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, thyroid, and von Willebrand"s disease and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can"t maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy"s grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder"s lines. Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and can be diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Usually both eyes are affected, but not necessarily to the same degree. Those dogs with minor anomaly make fine pets and usually do not lose their eyesight. Those that are more severely affected may lose their eyesight within a few years of diagnosis. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies. von Willebrand"s Disease is an inherited blood disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines, may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease lead normal lives, however. If you feel this is a concern, your vet can perform tests to determine if your dog has it or not. Canine hip dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can either be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by using the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn"t be bred. Ask the breeder from whom you get a puppy for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help. Dermatomyositis is an inherited disorder that can cause skin lesions and, in severe cases, affect the muscles. DM primarily affects Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs, although dogs in other breeds have been diagnosed. Some dogs never show any signs of the disease, but pass it along to their offspring. Signs are varied. Skin lesions may appear on the head, ears and front legs. There may be extensive hair loss and scarring on the face and ears, as well as on the legs and the tip of the tail. The only way to diagnose DM is through a skin punch biopsy evaluated by a dermapathologist. There"s no test yet for dermatomyositis, which is thought to be one gene with variable expression, meaning that a dog can carry it without showing signs of it.
Although Shelties were bred to withstand harsh weather conditions, they love their people and should live indoors with them as part of the family. While they can be relatively inactive indoors, Shelties were bred to be working farm dogs and need ample exercise. They enjoy going for walks, playing fetch with the kids, and running around the dining room table. Afterward, they"ll help you hold down the sofa. Because of their small size, Shelties can do well in an apartment if their people are committed to providing daily walks and playtime, as well as training them not to bark incessantly. This requires finesse. Shelties can have their feelings easily hurt by harsh treatment. Instead of yelling at your Sheltie for barking, acknowledge his alert ("Thanks for telling me about the squirrel in the yard") and give a verbal reprimand only if he continues barking. In general, Shelties respond best to positive reinforcement such as praise, play, and food rewards. Try to keep training interesting for your dog. Shelties can become bored easily, and see no point in repeating an exercise multiple times if it was done correctly the first time.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Sheltie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Sheltie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Shelties have a double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, causing the longer, harsher topcoat to stand out from the body. The hair on the head, ears, and feet is smooth, but the mane and frill (the hair around the neck and on the forechest) are abundant. The legs and tail are furry as well. You"ll see three basic colors in the breed, all with varying amounts of white and/or tan markings: Sable, ranging from golden to mahogany Black Blue Merle (blue-gray with black) A Sheltie who"s more than 50 percent white or who has a brindle coat won"t do for the show ring, but his color doesn"t affect his ability to be a great companion. The Shetland Sheepdog"s beautiful coat requires, at a minimum, a thorough weekly brushing with a pin brush. Be sure to get right down to the skin, and never brush a dry coat. Use a spray bottle to mist it as you go to prevent damage to the hair. Pay special attention to the fine hair behind the ears, which tends to tangle. If you find a mat in this area early, it can usually be brushed out with a small slicker brush. Your Sheltie will need extra brushing during shedding season. Males and spayed females generally shed once a year, while unspayed females shed twice a year, a couple of months after each estrus period. A proper Sheltie coat — a harsh outer coat and soft undercoat — sheds dirt and repels water, so Shelties need baths only when they get really dirty, which varies from dog to dog. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Sheltie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Sheltie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to keep his breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better. Start grooming your Sheltie when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Shelties are excellent family companions, especially when they"re raised with children who know how to handle dogs respectfully. As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs. Supervise all interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party. Never leave dogs and young children alone together. When it comes to other dogs, Shelties have a definite preference for their own kind, even if they don"t live with other Shelties. On first introduction, they seem to recognize other Shelties as kindred spirits and are usually immediately friendly and willing to play. They tend to be standoffish with new dogs of other breeds, however. They can get along with cats, once the cat puts the Sheltie in his place for trying to herd him.

Although today"s Poodles seem to epitomize a life of leisure and luxury, make no mistake: These are real dogs bred to do real jobs. Although it hardly seems possible when you look at a primped-up Poodle in the show ring, the breed was originally a water retriever, a job that requires jumping in the water to fetch waterfowl for hunters. In fact, the English name poodle is derived from the German word pudel, or pudelin, which means to splash in the water. And in France, Poodles are called Caniche, a name derived from chien canard, meaning duck dog. Even the elaborate coat styling that the breed"s known for once had a practical purpose: trimmed areas lightened the weight of the dog"s coat and wouldn"t snag on underwater debris, while long hair around the joints and vital organs protected the dog from the cold water. There are three sizes of Poodle, all considered part of the same breed: going from smallest to largest, these are the Toy, the Miniature, and the Standard. The Standard is probably the oldest of the three varieties, and some still carry on the Poodle tradition of working as a water retriever. No matter the size, Poodles are renowned for a playful but dignified personality and keen intelligence. When it comes to training, this is an "A" student, and the Poodle excels at performance sports such as obedience, agility, and hunt tests. Despite his regal air, the Poodle is no snob. These are people-friendly dogs who want to stay close to their families — they get lonely when left by themselves for long periods — and are always up for a good game.
If you spoil your Poodle and don"t train him, he"s likely to conclude that he"s the alpha dog of the family. This is especially common among the smaller varieties — Miniature and Toy Poodles — who are more likely to be coddled and untrained. Teach your dog good canine manners, and then insist that he use them; it shows him that you"re the leader of the pack. Because of their intelligence and playful nature, obedience training is essential to keep your Poodle"s mind active. A Poodle who is thinking and learning isn"t bored, and therefore won"t find destructive ways to occupy himself. The Poodle coat needs a lot of upkeep to stay beautiful and healthy. Most Poodle owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every three to six weeks. If you want to save money on grooming expenses, you can learn to do it yourself, but it takes time and effort. Poodles have weepy eyes that can stain the surrounding hair. To cut down on stains, gently wipe down the face daily with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dipped in warm water. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Poodle is one of the oldest breeds developed especially for hunting waterfowl. Most historians agree that the Poodle originated in Germany, but developed into his own distinct breed in France. Many believe that the breed is the result of crosses between several European water dogs, including Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Hungarian, and Russian water dogs. Other historians think that one of the Poodle"s ancestors is the North African Barbet, which was imported to the Iberian Peninsula. After that, the breed arrived in Gaul where it was used for his hunting abilities. It"s also commonly believed that Poodles descended from Asian herding dogs, and then traveled with the Germanic Goth and Ostrogoth tribes to eventually become a German water dog. Yet another theory is that the Poodle descended from dogs that were brought out of the Asian steppes by the conquering North African Berbers and eventually found his way into Portugal in the 8th Century with the Moors. Whatever its ancestry, this is a very old breed. Illustrations of Poodle-like dogs adorn Egyptian and Roman artifacts and tombs dating from the first centuries B.C. The drawings and statues show dogs that look very much like modern-day Poodles, bringing in game nets, herding animals, and retrieving game from marshes. Although some say that the Miniature and Toy Poodles emerged shortly after the Standard, many believe it wasn"t until the 1400s that breeders began producing smaller versions of the Poodle — first the Miniature, then the Toy — to delight the Parisian bourgeoise. The Toy and Miniature varieties were created by breeding small Poodles to each other, not by breeding Poodles to smaller breeds. The French used the larger Standard Poodle for duck hunting, and the mid-sized Miniature Poodle to sniff out truffles in the woods. The tiny Toy Poodle"s main job, on the other hand, was to serve as a companion to the nobility and wealthy merchant class. Well-to-do owners in the Renaissance often carried their Toy Poodles in their large shirtsleeves, leading to the nickname "sleeve dogs." Gypsies and traveling performers learned that Poodles excelled in another canine profession: circus dog. They trained Poodles to perform tricks, dressing them in costumes and sculpting their coats into fanciful shapes to add to their stage appeal. Wealthy patrons took note and started clipping, decorating, and even dying their own Poodle companions. The Kennel Club in England registered their first Poodle in 1874, with the first British club for Poodle fanciers arriving on the scene two years later. It"s not known for sure when Poodles arrived in the U.S., but the American Kennel Club registered their first Poodle in 1886. The Poodle Club of America was founded in 1896, but disbanded shortly thereafter. Poodle enthusiasts reestablished the club in 1931. Poodles were fairly rare in the U.S. until after World War II. By the mid-1950s, however, the Poodle had become the most popular breed in the country, a position he held for more than 20 years.
There are three sizes of Poodle: toy, miniature, and standard. These aren"t different breeds, just different sizes of the same dog. The Toy Poodle stands up to 10 inches tall, and weighs about six to nine pounds. The Miniature Poodle stands 11 to 15 inches tall and weighs 15 to 17 pounds. The Standard Poodle stands 15 inches and taller (usually 22 inches); males weigh 45 to 70 pounds and females weigh 45 to 60 pounds.
Intelligent, loving, loyal, and mischievous are four words Poodle enthusiasts commonly use to describe the breed"s personality. The Poodle is also known for what his fans call "an air of distinction": a dignified attitude that"s hard to describe, but easy to spot in the dog. Despite his regal appearance, the Poodle has a goofy streak and loves to play — he"s always up for a game of any kind. He"s also very fond of people and eager to please. Combine that with his legendary intelligence, and you"ve got a dog that"s highly trainable. A good Poodle who"s been taught canine manners has a calm disposition, especially if he gets regular exercise to burn off his natural energy. Some owners and breeders think the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles are a bit more high-strung than the Standard; however, other breeders and owners disagree with this theory. The Poodle is protective of his home and family, and if strangers approach your house, he"ll sound a warning bark to let you know. And although he"s affectionate with his family, he may take a while to warm up to new people. An outstanding trait of the Poodle is his intelligence. He is often said to have human-like intelligence, an amazing cleverness that astounds his owners. Of course, smart dogs can be difficult to live with. They learn fast — good habits and bad — and they remember everything.
Poodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Addison"s Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison"s disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison"s is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Poodles, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol resulting from other conditions. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Poodle exhibits these two symptoms, take it to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease, including surgery and medication. Epilepsy: A common cause of seizures in all varieties of Poodles is idiopathic epilepsy. It often is inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Poodle has seizures, it"s important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup. Hip Dysplasia: When the hip socket is poorly formed or the ligaments are loose enough to allow the ball of the thigh bone (femur) to slide part of the way out of the hip socket, it"s called dysplastic. Canine hip dysplasia is inherited, with environmental factors sometimes playing a large part in its development. Over time, there is degeneration of the joint that can cause arthritis and pain, even lameness. Excess weight, excessive or prolonged exercise before maturity, a fast growth rate, and high-calorie or supplemented diets can contribute to the development of canine hip dysplasia. Veterinary care includes nutritional supplements, medication and, in some cases, surgery. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by is an under active thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma and other skin conditions. Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Poodle has Legg-perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn"t attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose sight during the day. Many affected dogs adapt to their limited or loss of vision very well, as long as the surroundings remain the same. Optic Nerve Hypoplasia: This condition is a congenital failure if development of the optic nerve. It causes blindness and abnormal pupil response in the affected eye. Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): SA is a serious problem in Poodles, especially Standards. It"s estimated that 50 percent of all Standard Poodles are carriers, or affected. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that aids in preventing drying of the skin. It"s usually first noticed when the dog is from 1 to 5 years old. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary. Von Willebrand"s Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood"s ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.
Poodles do just fine in any type of home, from apartments to estates, so long as they have regular exercise and plenty of human companionship. They prefer to live indoors with the family, particularly the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles, since they have no trouble getting their ya-yas out in the house.   This intelligent breed learns quickly, but owners should be careful: It"s as easy to accidentally teach your Poodle bad habits as it is to teach him good ones, so if you"re new to dogs, sign up for an obedience class with a skilled trainer. That goes for Toy and Miniature Poodles as well. Many owners of small dogs skip training, and wind up with a badly behaved dog.
Recommended daily amount: Standards, 1.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; Miniatures, 3/4 to 1 cup; Toys, 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Like any breed, the poodle will pack on weight if he"s overfed, which can cause joint problems and other health woes. Limit treats, keep him active, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Although many owners of Miniature or Toy Poodles in particular give their dogs table scraps, resist those pleading eyes — you"ll create a finicky eater. He"ll turn up his nose at dog food, which is healthier for him. Keep your Poodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Poodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Poodle is a non-shedding breed, and a god bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Shiba Inu to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Shiba Inu is a good family dog, as long as he is raised properly and receives training and proper socialization when he"s young. He gets along with children who treat him kindly and respectfully.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Early training and socialization go a long way in helping the Shiba Inu get along with other dogs and animals, but it"s not a guarantee. He can be aggressive toward other dogs and he will chase animals he perceives as prey. Training and keeping him on leash are the best ways to manage the Shiba Inu with other dogs and animals.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  1 foot, 4 inches to 1 foot, 5 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  25 to 35 poundsLife Span:  10 to 15 years
The Puli, also known as the Hungarian Puli and the Hungarian Water Dog, is still used for herding sheep in his homeland. Hungarian shepherds take great pride in the Puli and his abilities; there"s a saying among Hungarian shepherds: "He"s not a dog, he"s a Puli." Pulik (the plural form of Puli) are self-confident, highly intelligent, and sensitive to their owners. Many tend to act as babysitters and guardians of children and other animals in the family. They can be very sensitive to the needs of the elderly and the sick. making them great therapy dogs. Although he"s affectionate and enjoys (and expects) the adoration of his family and friends, he"s suspicious of strangers. The Puli is a strong-willed dog who will attempt to boss you around (nicely), sometimes without you even realizing it. His instinct is to protect and herd, which can sometimes extend to telling you when it"s time to go to bed or where to sit, or moving the kids from one room to another. The distinct Puli coat, which can take about four years to grow in and cord completely, comes in solid colors of rusty black, black, all shades of gray, and white. In Hungary, a common color is fako, which is described as the color of the inside of a whole-wheat roll. His corded coat makes the Puli look much larger than he really is. The width of the coat across the back can be three times wider than the actual dog. Underneath all that hair, the Puli weighs about 30 pounds and stands 16 to 17 inches tall. This unique coat requires a great deal of grooming to keep it clean and attractive, however. It is not a coat for beginners. In fact, even many professional groomers do not know how to properly care for a corded coat — not necessarily because they"re lacking skills, but because the average pet owner rarely keeps a dog in cords. If your heart is set on owning a Puli, you"ll need to learn how to maintain the coat on your own. Ask advice from a Puli breeder, or find someone well-versed in grooming a corded coat. Some owners elect to trim off the coat to make it easier to care for, though diehard Puli enthusiasts cringe at the thought of this: the cords are a vital part of the Puli identity, they say. While trimming the coat off is perfectly acceptable for a pet, the show Puli appears only with cords in most countries. He can be shown with cords or brushed out in the United States, however. The Puli isn"t born with his dreadlocks. Newborns are round puppies with a little crimp to their coats, which soon grows into fluff. The adult coat comes in at about one year of age, at which time the fluff is separated by hand into cords. This process of separating the cords continues for about three or four months until the cords are set. At maturity (about four years of age), the coat reaches the ground. Cords on the head fall over the face, veiling the eyes. Some owners tie up these cords to keep them out of the dog"s face. Obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is essential for the Puli to teach him proper canine manners. Keep in mind that the Puli is highly intelligent and independent — so he becomes bored with repetitive training. Keep lessons fresh, short, and fun to maintain his interest. Agility and herding are two activities perfectly suited to the breed"s natural instincts and playful, spirited nature. In fact, if you try your hand at herding competitions with your Puli, don"t be surprised to see Border Collie enthusiasts watching your dog in awe. While Border Collies were bred to handle smaller flocks of sheep, the Puli typically handles flocks of 400 or more, and he looks like a tornado as he whirls around the flock to keep it under control. An added benefit to participating in canine sports is that it helps you fulfill a basic Puli need: being the center of attention.
The Puli is vocal and tends to bark. The Puli loves his family but is suspicious of strangers. Because he"s a highly intelligent dog with a great deal of self-confidence, the Puli gets bored with repetitive tasks, such as obedience. Agility and herding are much more to his liking. The Puli can be a bit stubborn, so housetraining might be a challenge at first. Crate training is recommended. Pulik have a reputation for remaining puppyish well into their older years. They love to play and like to have a lot of toys. Grooming the Puli is difficult, especially if the coat is corded. New owners should seek help to learn how to properly groom their dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Puli is an ancient breed with a history that reaches back at least 2,000 years. Some believe a dog similar to the Puli existed 6,000 or more years ago; others believe the Puli derived more recently from the Tibetan Terrier. Around the turn of the century, crews excavating for oil in what is now known as Iraq — once home to the ancient civilization known as Sumeria — came across the grave of a man who had been buried with a medium-sized dog and a sheep. Among the artifacts in the grave, they found a long, coarse knot of hair that was almost white with age. The makeup of that hair was very much like that of today"s Puli. It"s believed that this man was a shepherd, buried with his favorite sheepdog and a sheep. There are indications that the Sumerians used Pulik or Puli-type dogs to herd sheep thousands of years ago. Clay plaques found in excavations of the town of Eridu reveal the Sumerian laws about animals. One of these has lines that refer to a Puli and a Komondor, another herding dog. Also in the same excavation site, an undamaged statuette of a Puli was found in the crypt of an eight-year-old girl. About 1,100 years ago, Magyar tribesmen brought Pulik to Hungary, where they became prized for their herding abilities. Many of the shepherds preferred black dogs because they were easier to see among the white flocks. It"s thought that the Puli was used to herd and drive the sheep, while the larger Komondor was used to guard the flocks. Back then, a good Puli cost as much as a shepherd"s full year of wages. As much as they valued their dogs, however, they were ruthless in culling those who weren"t as intelligent or weren"t able to perform their duties well. Many think that this culling is the reason why the Puli is such an intelligent and healthy breed today. By the 1800s, the Hungarian shepherds determined the very best characteristics of these small sheepdogs, and they tried to breed specifically to produce high-quality animals. In the late 1800s, the first description of the Puli was written — but by then the need for the sheepdog was diminishing, and so were his numbers. In 1912, Dr. Emil Raitsits, a professor at the Hungarian University of Veterinary Medicine, began a program to save the Puli from extinction. Adolf Lendl, the director of the Budapest Zoo, joined in the efforts. Together they remodeled part of the zoo for an experimental breeding program and exhibit. The program expanded, and they eventually named their kennel Allatkert. The foundation stock for many Hungarian kennels came from the Allatkert Kennel. In 1915, enthusiasts wrote the first breed standard for the Puli. In 1924, the Federation Cynologique Internationale (International Kennel Club) approved this standard. At first there were three categories of Puli: the ancestral (working) Puli with a shaggy coat; the luxury or show Puli; and the dwarf Puli. In 1935, four sizes of Pulik were recognized: the police Puli (19.7 inches high); the working or medium Puli (15.7 to 19.7 inches); the small Puli (11.8 to 15.7 inches); and the dwarf, miniature, or toy Puli (11 inches and under). The medium-sized Puli was the most popular. By this time, owning a Puli, a Komondor, or other native Hungarian breeds became a source of pride in Hungary. About the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture became interested in the Puli and, in 1935, imported four purebred Pulik to take part in herding dog tests conducted at the Department"s facility in Beltsville, Maryland. The Puli were said to have scored high marks on these tests, though the results were never published. At the outbreak of World War II, the tests were stopped and the Pulik were sold to professional breeders. The original four dogs and their progeny are thought to be the first Pulik in the United States. World War II was devastating to Hungary and also to dog breeders, particularly those in Europe. Food was scarce and there were no medical supplies. Kennels had to give their valuable breeding stock to people in other countries, and the Pulik who were left behind were often killed by bombs or shot by German or Russian soldiers. If the breed hadn"t been so popular before the war, it probably would be extinct now. Just as the Puli survived the harsh plains of Hungary, he beat the odds and, after the war, the number of Pulik in Hungary grew. In 1959, the Hungarian Puli Club created a Puli breed standard that eliminated the toy and police-size Pulik and included all of the remaining sizes in one category. By the 1960s, the number of Pulik in Hungary had reached prewar numbers. The Puli was accepted for American Kennel Club registration in 1936, and the Puli Club of America was formed in 1951.
Males are 17 inches tall and weigh 30 to 35 pounds. Females are 16 inches tall and weigh 25 to 30 pounds.
The unusual corded coat often draws the attention of those unfamiliar with the breed. But to those who know and love the Puli, it"s his personality that stands out. The Puli is fun-loving and affectionate, and he enjoys the company of his family. He"s also smart, hardworking, and athletic. Being suspicious of strangers, he makes a good watchdog. He"s also a strong-willed dog who requires a firm but kind owner. Don"t be surprised when he tries to "herd" you or your children. Many Pulik are vocal and like to bark. A "quiet" command should be part of early training. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Puli needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Pulik are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pulik will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pulik, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Cataracts: These afflictions cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.
The Puli is a herding dog at heart, and he does best in a home with enough space for him to race off his natural energy. A large, fenced yard (make that a very tall fence) or a farm is ideal. He can adjust to smaller living spaces, but be prepared for his running laps around the dining room chairs and taking leaps over the couch. Exercise and playtime aside, bring the Puli indoors to live with you. He"s a loyal companion who enjoys being with people, and he shouldn"t be permanently relegated to the backyard. The agile Puli is a good candidate for many canine sports, especially herding tests, agility, and obedience competition (though obedience work can seem repetitive to the fun-loving Puli). If he"s not a working dog, he needs the mental and physical challenges available in dog sports. Otherwise he can become bored, which can lead to destructive behaviors such as barking, digging, and chewing. The Puli"s agility can get him in trouble, however. It"s been reported that Pulik can jump six-foot fences, so be sure your yard has a secure, high fence to keep him from escaping and injuring himself. Proper training and socialization are essential for the strong-willed Puli. He must learn good canine manners, and you must learn not to be bossed around by him. This dog is a leader, and he will lead you if you allow him to.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Puli in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Puli, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Puli coat is considered to be nonshedding and hypoallergenic. Most Pulik are black, though white and gray are also found in the United States. In Hungary, the most common color after black is the brownish fako (described as the color of a whole-wheat roll). Black coats are described as a "weathered" black, because some white hairs begin to grow in when the dog is about a year old. In addition, because the cords don"t shed, they lose some of their color intensity over time due to exposure to the sun and air. Some Puli coats are self-cording, though most are helped along by humans who separate the cords by hand when the adult coat comes in (at about one year of age). As the coat texture changes from puppy fluff to adult coat, the undercoat is packed into the interior of the outer coat tendril to form a felt-like structure. It takes about four years for the coat to become fully mature. Keep the fluffy, uncorded Puli coat in good condition through regular brushing and combing to remove tangles and dirt and to distribute natural skin oils. The corded coat is never brushed but managed by hand: first it"s dampened with water, then the cords are separated and twirled. The length of the corded coat is sometimes trimmed to keep it from collecting dust and dirt. Bathing a fluffy Puli coat is like bathing any other breed. Put the dog in the tub, add water and soap, and scrub. Dunking your corded-coat Puli in the tub, however, is a time-consuming task that takes a lot of hard work. First, the cords must be thoroughly soaked with water (this takes a while), and then you can work in some diluted shampoo. Rinsing can take up to 30 minutes. Following that, the cords are squeezed dry, first by hand and then with a towel. After a bath, some owners put a heavy sweatshirt on the Puli to continue soaking up the water. Air-drying the coat can take up s tend to shed less than those who live in warmer climates. You can avoid matting — and excess hair on your furniture — if you commit to brushing your dog"s coat at least once a week during the year — and daily during shedding season.Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and will take the time to clean themselves — much like a cat will. They don"t typically emit "doggy" odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the backyard or find a stinky body of water to jump in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural oils in your dog"s skin and coat.Huskies come in a variety of colors and markings, from black to pure white with colored markings on the body that include reds and coppers. Their eyes can be brown, blue, or a combination. Their faces sport masks that add to their eye appeal.Brush your Husky"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Husky to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Huskies make great pets for households with children. They can be very tolerant of children, but like all other dogs, should be supervised when around young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Siberian Huskies do get along with other dogs but it is still important to take your puppy to socialization classes. This gets them used to other dogs and also to people, although they are also very affectionate to strangers. Socialization teaches puppies how to behave and greet other dogs and their owners.Keep in mind the history of this breed. The harsh conditions in Siberia created a strong prey drive in this breed because food was often hard to find. As a result, many Huskies today maintain that prey drive toward small animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and cats. Some Huskies, however, thrive in multi-pet households, especially when they are raised with other pets from puppyhood.

The Silky, as he"s often called, is an elegant little dog with a beautiful, silky — hopefully that wasn"t a surprise — coat of tan and blue. Beneath that delicate-looking exterior, however, is a big, bold spirit. People unfamiliar with the breed are often surprised to see the small Silky warn off intruders, romp with large dogs, or keep up with their owners on a hike. But this shouldn"t be a shock. The Silky is, after all, a terrier, with a true terrier temperament: scrappy, tenacious, and fond of digging, barking, and chasing. If you don"t consider these characteristics endearing, the Silky Terrier isn"t for you. Despite the tough attitude, however, the Silky"s a loyal dog who loves to be with his family. He"s best suited to homes where he won"t be left home alone for long periods: he needs the companionship of his human pack, and he"s apt to get into mischief if he isn"t supervised. The Silky needs daily physical and mental exercise, and will be happy to join you for a walk in the neighborhood or a hike in the country. Despite his high energy, he can be an apartment or condo dog. He does have a propensity to bark though, so a "Quiet" command should be part of his basic canine manners. (The upside: he"ll let you know when you have visitors.) The Silky Terrier who"s exposed to kids beginning in puppyhood can be a good companion for children older than 10, as long as they treat him carefully and kindly. He may not tolerate poking and prodding from toddlers and very young kids. For the right owner, this fun-loving and energetic companion can add spice, and a lot of love, to life.
Silky Terriers are active dogs who need exercise and mental stimulation. This doesn"t mean strenuous hikes or hours of retrieving, but it does mean you"ll need to provide more activity than tummy rubs on the couch. Although they need exercise, they can make good apartment or condo dogs. Silkies have a strong prey drive and will chase cats, squirrels, rodents, and sometimes other dogs. A Silky may not be the best choice if you"ve got other small pets. Also, keep your Silky leashed when you"re in unsecured areas to avoid having him disappear into the wild blue yonder when something small and furry streaks by. Silkies like to be with their families and are happiest when they can spend the whole day in your company. Despite the long coat, Silkies are fairly easy keepers. But they do require some grooming: thorough brushing two to three times a week and a monthly bath. Like all terriers, the Silky enjoys digging. To save your flowerbeds, either consider another breed, or train your Silky to dig in a specific area. It"s much easier to channel the instinct than to suppress it. Barking, another terrier trait, is a much-enjoyed pastime for Silkies. Although you can teach your Silky a "Quiet" command, he"ll still bark when he thinks it"s necessary. The upside is, Silkies are excellent watchdogs. Silky Terriers can be good family dogs, but because of their scrappy personality, children should be about 10 years old and up. Although they"re generally friendly, Silkies can be territorial and aggressive toward other dogs if they"re not socialized properly. A Silky shouldn"t be left unattended in a yard. He"s small enough to be considered prey by larger wild animals, terrier enough to dig his way out, and Silky enough to get into mischief. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Silky Terrier originated in Australia in the 1890s, when breeders crossed imported Yorkshire Terriers with their native Australian Terriers. Some of the offspring looked like Yorkies, some looked like Australian Terriers, and others looked like the Silky of today, with a size and coat length that was between the two parent breeds. The Silky-looking dogs were interbred until the puppies predictably had Silky traits. In 1906, Australian fanciers developed a breed standard — written guidelines for what the breed should look, move, and act like — in Sydney, New South Wales. In 1909, another standard was drawn up in Victoria. The two standards didn"t completely match up, mostly on the preferred weight and ear type. The two camps compromised and a new breed standard came out in 1926. The breed has had several names: initially, he was called the Sydney Silky Terrier. In 1955, he became the Australian Silky Terrier (still the official name for the breed in Australia). In the U.S., the name was changed to Silky Terrier.
Males and females stand nine to 10 inches tall, and weigh eight to 10 pounds.
The Silky Terrier is a friendly, intelligent, spirited, and self-assured. True to his hunting roots, he loves to chase small animals, and won"t back down from a fight. Despite his small size he makes an excellent watchdog, as he"s quick to sound the alarm if something or someone strange enters his turf. Though independent, the Silky is devoted to his people and is happiest when he"s part of daily family life. He likes to be in the house, following you room to room, or joining you at the front door to bark at your guests. He does best if he can be with his human "pack" most of the day. If you travel a lot, this adaptable dog would be happy to hit the road with you. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Silky needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Silky puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This involves the hip joint. If your Westie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Tracheal Collapse: This is often seen in smaller breeds and can be seen occasionally in the Silky Terrier. It is caused by a weakening of the cartilage; the tracheal or windpipe flattens and obstructs the airway. Symptoms include coughing that sounds like a goose honk, fainting, and an intolerance to exercise. It is treated with antibiotics, steroids, cough suppressants, and using a harness instead of a collar. If medical treatment does not work, surgery is recommended.
The Silky Terrier may look like a toy, but he"s a real dog who needs exercise and training. He enjoys daily walks, romping with you in the yard, or trips to a dog park with a special area for small breeds. In a pinch, the Silky is happy to take his workout indoors with a rousing game of fetch in the hallway. These are not outdoor dogs. The Silky craves the companionship of his people, and he"s also small enough to be considered prey by wild animals. And despite his size, another risk is that he may fight with another dog who wanders onto his turf. When it comes to training, Silky Terriers make willing and able students. Because they"re so smart, however, you need to be consistent; otherwise they"ll be inclined to make up their own rules. The best way to win your Silky"s cooperation is with fun lessons that use positive reinforcement. Crate training is the easiest way to housetrain your Silky, and crates are also a good way to keep your Silky safe and out of trouble when you"re away from home. Silky Terriers are mischievous by nature and can be destructive when left unsupervised. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Silky in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Silkys are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies need about 1/8 to 1/4 cup a day. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Base the amount of food you give on your Silky"s physical condition, not by how hungry he acts. He"s a con artist, and if he can trick you into doling out more food, he will. Keep your Silky in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Silky, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
This breed"s coat is beautiful: long and sleek, parted down the back, and hanging five to six inches down. The color is a rich tan and various shades of blue. You might peg the Silky as a fussy breed, grooming-wise, but he really isn"t. A thorough brushing and combing two to three times a week (and before bathtime), along with a bath every month or so will keep your Silky clean and tangle-free. Brush your Silky"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Silky to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Silky can be a wonderful family pet, so long as he"s raised with kids and grows up around their noise and commotion. Given his strong personality, though, he"s usually best for families with children older than 10 who know how to handle a dog. He may not tolerate pokes and prods from younger kids. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Silky gets along with other dogs very well so long as he"s been raised to be dog-friendly, though there may be occasional bossiness and rivalry for attention or treats. Like all terriers, the Silky loves to chase small animals, so he may not be suited for homes with cats, rabbits, or other small pets.

This lean, leggy sighthound likes his comforts — especially soft bedding and, ideally, access to the furniture. Noble and haughty in demeanor, he"s affectionate with his own people but aloof toward strangers. He gets along with older children who understand how to interact with dogs, but isn"t a good match for a family with young kids. Sloughis are sleek, clean, and quiet, but their stubborn hound nature can make them a poor choice for first-time dog owners.

Despite his name, the Small Munsterland Pointer is more of a medium-size dog. He"s a popular hunting dog in Europe and is beginning to make a name for himself in the U.S. as well. Loyal and affectionate, he"s generally easy to train and has great water-retrieving skills in both salt and freshwater. Like any sporting breed, he needs plenty of daily exercise. He does best in a home where he can use his hunting skills or turn his intelligence to a challenging dog sport or activity such as agility, flyball, or search and rescue work.

The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (Wheaten for short) originated in Ireland as a versatile farm dog. Today he"s a versatile family dog, adaptable to life in city or country as long as he gets the exercise and attention he needs.Consider a Wheaten if you like terrier looks but find their personalities a bit overwhelming. Don"t get us wrong! The Wheaten has typical terrier traits, being a lively and happy dog, but he tends to be less scrappy than some other terrier breeds we know.He"s highly people-oriented and loves kids, and his moderate size and exercise needs mean he fits well into most homes. The all-purpose Wheaten will enjoy going for walks or hikes and competing in agility or flyball. He can also win titles in tracking and herding and makes a super therapy dog.Expect your Wheaten to greet you by bounding straight up to give you a kiss or even jumping into your arms. He"ll twirl when he"s happy, rest his head on your lap when he wants something, frolic in the snow just for the fun of it, and frown at being expected to go out in the rain. (Ironically, this Irish import doesn"t like to get wet.)It"s clear that the Wheaten has lots of pluses, but no dog"s perfect. For starters, that abundant silky coat needs lots of grooming to stay gorgeous. He can be a messy eater, finishing a meal by wiping his beard on your sofa, and debris from the outdoors gets caught in his coat and deposited around the house. If you"re looking for a no-muss, no-fuss breed, this isn"t the one. He can also be stubborn, meaning you"ll have to be firm — not harsh, just firm — and consistent with training.If you don"t have time for the Wheaten"s grooming and training needs, think twice before you get one. But if you can take care of him, you"ll never regret bringing this steady but fun-loving dog into your life.
Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers can adapt to just about any kind of home, city or country, apartment or suburban house. If you"re a neat freak, this may not be the breed for you. The Wheaten coat attracts dirt, debris, and snow, which is then deposited throughout the house. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers generally aren"t aggressive and can get along with most dogs and other pets. They"ll chase small, furry creatures outside however, including roaming cats. Although they"re not yappy, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier will bark if he sees or hears something suspicious. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers don"t do well in heat. Keep your Wheatie indoors on hot days. Terriers love to dig, and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is no exception. Be prepared for some holes in your yard. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers want to keep their people company, and they can get stressed when left alone for long periods. This can lead to destructive behaviors and barking. Give your Wheaten at least 30 minutes of daily exercise to keep him healthy and happy. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are good with children. Wheatens have minds of their own, which can make training a challenge. Be firm and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers shed little, but their coats need frequent brushing and combing to remove tangles. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.
In Ireland, the terrier was the poor man"s dog, a versatile farm dog who could rid the place of vermin, do a little hunting, and help guard the property against intruders, both animal and human.Much of the Wheaten"s early history wasn"t recorded, but he probably shares a common ancestor with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier. They also share a sign that they were working dogs: a docked tail, which told the tax collector that they were exempt from the tax on dogs.The Wheaten wasn"t recognized as a breed by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937, on St. Patrick"s Day. To win a championship, he was required to qualify in field trials, with rats, rabbits, and badgers as prey, a rule that"s since gone by the wayside.The first Wheatens arrived in the U.S. in November of 1946. A Boston Globe Post report listed seven of them among the cargo of the freighter Norman J. Coleman, which docked in Boston after journeying from Belfast. Two of the pups went home with Lydia Vogel of Springfield, Massachusetts. Vogel showed them the next year at the Westminster Kennel Club show, and they produced 17 puppies.It wasn"t until 1962, however, that the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America was founded in Brooklyn. Naturally, the first meeting took place on St. Patrick"s Day. Attendees included three canine pioneers of the breed: Holmenocks Gramachree, Gads Hill, and Holmenocks Hallmark.The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1973, and Holmenocks Gramachree became the first Wheaten to be registered by the AKC. Today, the breed ranks 62nd in popularity among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males average 18 to 19 inches in height and weigh 35 to 40 pounds; females are 17 to 18 inches and weigh 30 to 35 pounds.
Happy, steady, and self-confident, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is alert enough to be a good watchdog, but too friendly to back up his warning barks. He loves kids and gets along with other animals, especially when he"s been raised with them. He will chase any small, furry creature that crosses his path outside, however.Like every dog, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Wheaten puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Not all Wheatens will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed: Protein-Losing Nephropathy means an excessive amount of proteins and plasma is lost through the kidney. Symptoms include weight loss, swelling of the legs or abdomen, diarrhea, increased urination and thirst, labored breathing, and kidney failure. Usually dogs with Protein-Losing Nephropathy have increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, as well as anemia, high cholesterol, and increased phosphorous. There"s no cure, but the condition can be managed through medications and diet. Protein-Losing Enteropathy (PLE) is characterized by the loss of an excessive amount of proteins and plasma through the gastrointestinal tract. Signs include weight loss, swelling of the legs or abdomen, diarrhea, increased urination, increased thirst, and labored breathing. Usually dogs with PLE have low levels of cholesterol, albumin, and globulin. There"s no cure for PLE, but the condition can be managed with medication and diet. Addison"s Disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, is a serious condition caused by insufficient production of adrenal hormones. Most dogs with Addison"s disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to miss this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison"s, she may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis. Renal Dysplasia (RD) involves abnormal development of the kidney, and can result in early renal failure. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has a known inherited basis for RD. Signs include increased water consumption and urination, poor appetite, vomiting, and sometimes, frequent urinary tract infections.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Wheatens, you should expect to see the results of annual blood and urine tests for kidney function and abnormalities associated with protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, renal dysplasia, and Addison"s disease and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier can adapt to a variety of homes, including apartments, as long as he gets enough exercise. No matter what kind of home he has, this people-loving dog should live inside, with his human family, not outdoors by himself.Give your Wheaten at least a half hour of exercise daily. This can be a couple of 15-minute walks, a walk and a good game of fetch, or practice for whatever dog sports the two of you enjoy.Begin training early, first with puppy kindergarten, then with a basic obedience class. The Wheaten has a mind of his own, and to train him successfully, you"ll need to be firm and consistent — but not harsh. He responds well to positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.He"ll enjoy playing with you in the yard, but make sure it"s securely fenced: terriers are hunters and will take off after small animals if they"re not confined. An underground electronic fence is unlikely to stop a Wheaten who"s hot on the trail of something small and furry.Despite their Irish origins, Wheatens aren"t fond of rain, but they relish playing in snow. Heat makes them wilt, so keep your Wheatie in air-conditioned comfort when the temperature soars.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Wheaten in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Wheaten, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier"s silky single coat makes him stand out from the rest of the terrier family. The abundant coat covers the entire body in gentle waves, with a fall of hair over the eyes.The color is, well, any shade of wheaten, ranging from pale beige to shimmering gold. If you look closely, you might find the occasional red, white, or black hair, and the muzzle and ears sometimes have blue-gray shading.Puppies have their own distinctive look. They"re born with dark coats that lighten with age. Often, the final color doesn"t emerge until pups are two years old, and the coats aren"t wavy until the dog reaches maturity.Being a single-coated breed, meaning he has no undercoat, the Wheaten sheds only lightly. He"s often touted as being nonallergenic or hypoallergenic, but in reality, no dog is nonallergenic — they all produce allergens in the form of dander and saliva. If you"re allergic to dogs, spend plenty of time around many different Wheatens to test if they trigger a reaction.You only need to bathe your Wheaten when it"s really necessary. How much time you spend grooming depends on the look you want. If you want him to look like a classic Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, you"ll need to groom daily. If you don"t mind a somewhat scruffier look, you can get by with 10 to 15 minutes of brushing and combing two or three times a week.In either case, you"ll need a stainless steel Greyhound comb, a dematting comb, a pin brush, a slicker brush, a pair of thinning shears for trimming the fall (the hair over the eyes), and a regular pair of scissors.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Wheaten"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Wheaten jumps up to greet you.Start grooming your Wheaten when he"s a puppy, to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier does well with kids of all ages, and he"s sturdy enough to withstand their handling. However, as with any breed, always teach children how to approach and touch your Wheaten, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children, to prevent any biting or tail pulling from either party.The Wheaten is less territorial and less aggressive toward other dogs than many other terriers. He gets along with other pets, especially if he"s raised with them. He"s not above a good chase, though, and squirrels and other small, furry animals —  including free-roaming cats — had better move their tails if they stray into a Wheaten"s yard.

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier can be an imposing dog with its strong, muscular body, intense stare, and powerful stance. Many are interested in the breed because it looks like a tough dog but are surprised to learn that the Stafford is a sensitive and loving companion who enjoys playing more than being tough. He sees life as a joyful adventure and lives it to the fullest. Fans love the Staffordshire Bull Terrier for his small to medium size, short, easy-care coat, and dynamic yet gentle personality. With his short, broad head and muscular body, he resembles the other bull breeds such as American Staffordshire Terriers and American Pit Bull Terriers, but he is a breed unto himself with distinct physical characteristics that set him apart, including size and ear shape. The Stafford is known for his love of people and trustworthy nature. He has been described as "a sort of everybody"s Man Friday," and his greatest desire is to spend time with his people, whether that means vegging out on the sofa and watching football, running errands in the car, going for walks, or participating in activities such as agility, flyball, obedience, and therapy work. Expect to give this athletic and energetic dog a vigorous walk every day, as well as plenty of attention during downtime. He dislikes being left to his own devices. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are not a breed that can be left outside alone or at home for long periods of time without human companionship. Nicknamed the nanny dog, the Stafford is prized for his patience with and love of children, although it goes without saying that no dog should ever be left alone with young children or expected to double as a baby-sitter. He is not always so friendly toward dogs he doesn"t know however, a remnant of his origin as a fighting breed, which required him to be aggressive toward other dogs yet gentle with human handlers. Be aware that some municipalities restrict the ownership of bull breeds. Be sure that yours is not one of them before acquiring a Stafford. For the person who has an understanding of his sensitive nature and can give him patient, firm leadership, the Stafford is one of the finest dog companions around.
The SBT should not be left to live outside. He"s a companion dog and thrives in the presence of his family. Because he may be aggressive toward unknown dogs, a Stafford should never be walked off leash. Staffords are highly intelligent, but they are also freethinkers who like to do things their own way. They need firm, patient, consistent training. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are energetic dogs who need a vigorous walk or play session daily. SBTs enjoy their comforts and will readily join you on the sofa or bed if allowed. Staffords shed little, although they may have a heavy shed once a year. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny. The Stafford needs early socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals. The SBT is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. Staffords love to chew, especially during puppyhood. Provide them with tough, durable toys. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers. Reinforce the bottom of fences with concrete or chicken wire so they can"t dig beneath them. Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well in apartments if they are properly exercised, but ideal living quarters include a fenced yard where they can play. Staffordshire Bull Terriers do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don"t overheat. Staffords love children, but despite their nickname of "nanny dog," they should not double as a baby-sitter. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs. If properly socialized and raised with them, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Staffordshire Bull Terriers will never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a strong prey drive which will send them after small animals around your neighborhood including cats. Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a high pain threshold and can become injured without any outward sign, such as whining. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a restricted or banned breed in many cities and the number of cities restricting the breed is rising. It is important to research your city"s dog by-laws to avoid the unnecessary seizure and destruction of your dog. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are extremely mouthy as puppies and can be destructive if not closely supervised. Staffordshire Bull Terriers are protective of family members, but they are not too concerned about property. They are more likely to welcome burglars than to guard the silver. Never buy a Stafford from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier shares a common ancestor — the Bulldog — with the American Staffordshire Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier, and the Bull Terrier. It was created in the early nineteenth century to be smaller and faster in the fighting ring, yet gentle and friendly toward people. It was probably developed by crossing the Bulldog with an ancestor of the Manchester Terrier. The cross eventually evolved into the Staffordshire Bull Terrier we see today. The first Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed in England in 1835, and a breed standard was written shortly thereafter. In the United States, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier generally enjoyed life as a family companion, and it wasn"t until 1975 that the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club. The first Stafford registered with the AKC was named Tinkinswood Imperial. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America was founded in 1974. Today, the Stafford is ranked 85th among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC. They are excellent dogs who truly embody the description "man"s best friend," and many enthusiasts know that they own one of the best kept secrets of the dog world.
Staffords stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder, with males being taller. Male Staffords weigh 28 to 38 pounds; females, 24 to 34 pounds.
Loving toward people from just a few weeks of age, a proper Stafford is never shy or snarly. He is energetic and enthusiastic in everything he does and remains on alert, even in repose. This breed"s temperament is described as tough, courageous, tenacious (read: stubborn), and curious. A people-loving personality makes him a good caretaker of his family, but he"s less likely to be protective of property. Because he"s so attentive and interested in people, however, he"ll always alert you to the presence of visitors, wanted or unwanted. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Stafford puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all SBTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In SBTs, you should expect to see health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems may occur in the breed: Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition that is thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Patellar Luxation: This common problem occurs when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and often slips out of place, causing the dog to skip or hop when it happens. It is thought to be hereditary. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts: The development of opacity or cloudiness in the lens of the eye at an early age. This condition progresses rapidly, and dogs can be blind by 3 years of age. Surgery can sometimes partially restore vision. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. L-2 Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria: Affected dogs lack a particular enzyme to break down the aforementioned compound. It then builds up in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, causing such signs as lack of coordination, muscle tremors, poor learning ability, and seizures. Signs can be treated, but there is no cure. Dogs with this condition are usually euthanized at an early age. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. Buy only from breeders who use this DNA test to screen their breeding animals. Skin Allergies: Also known as atopic dermatitis, this itchy, scratchy condition is sometimes seen in certain Staffords. It"s not unusual for afflicted dogs to suffer hair loss or to develop sore spots on their skin. The problem is often compounded by bacterial infections. Aggressive flea control treatment can help, as can supplementing the diet with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil. Demodectic Mange: All dogs carry demodex mites. The mites live in hair follicles and usually don"t cause any problems, but dogs with weakened or compromised immune systems can develop a condition called demodectic mange. Also called demodicosis, it can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It"s thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The good news is that the mite can"t be passed to humans or other dogs.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a companion dog who does well in any type of home as long as he gets daily exercise. He should live indoors, with access to a securely fenced yard. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers, so it is important to reinforce fences by embedding them in concrete or burying chicken wire at the bottom to prevent escapes. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Stafford will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight. His short face makes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier unsuited to staying outdoors for more than a few minutes in a hot or humid climate, and he should always have access to shade and fresh drinking water. Some Staffords enjoy playing in water and will appreciate having a kiddie pool to lounge in on hot days, but others prefer to avoid the wet stuff. Staffords are not good swimmers, so take steps to protect them from falling into a swimming pool or spa. The Stafford"s exercise requirements can be satisfied with two or three half-hour to one-hour walks or playtimes daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities. Begin training the day you bring your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he can be impulsive and stubborn. Forget strict and formal obedience training. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Stafford. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog"s self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Stafford is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself. A Stafford is not generally a barker, but he is definitely vocal. This breed will entertain you with his snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as his singing voice, often described as a yodel. If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Stafford. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your SBT puppy from chewing on things he shouldn"t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren"t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Stafford will be a strong puller, small size notwithstanding. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Stafford"s safety. Never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals. He has a strong prey drive and will give chase if not restrained. Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your SBT to be friendly toward other animals. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn"t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Stafford will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 2 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your SBT in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the skin. It comes in red, fawn, white, black, or blue, or any of these colors with white, as well as brindle or brindle with white. The Stafford"s coat sheds annually and hair loss is minimal throughout the year. Dirt brushes out easily, and the coat dries quickly after a bath. Brush him weekly to remove dead or loose hair. Bathe as needed. This breed has little odor, so he usually doesn"t require frequent bathing. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Stafford"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don"t get caught in the carpet and tear. Check the ears weekly to make sure there"s no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog"s breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don"t stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Begin accustomizing your Staffordshire Bull Terrier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Stafford is suitable for families with children, but despite his much vaunted patience and gentleness, he should always be supervised in the presence of toddlers or young children. He can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock small children down. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any mouthing, biting, or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating and not to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Some Staffords get along well with other dogs and cats when they"re raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the company of another dog. To ensure the best relationship, choose a dog of the opposite sex. Make introductions in a neutral area away from your home.

The Standard Schnauzer is a medium-size dog who inspired early breeders to develop two more breeds who look just like him — the Miniature Schnauzer and the Giant Schnauzer. It"s no wonder breeders wanted to duplicate this dog in different sizes for different needs. Standard Schnauzers are not only highly intelligent and excellent family companions, they"re uniquely handsome, even aristocratic, in appearance. Renowned for their guarding abilities and devotion to their families, they"re also often described as a dog with a human brain. Squarely built, these dogs have stiff, wiry coats that shed little with minimal "doggy" odor. A hallmark of the breed is the face furnishings, which include arched eyebrows and a bristly mustache and beard. The high-set ears are carried erect when cropped but are otherwise V-shaped, carried forward with the inner edge of the ear close to the cheek. Standard Schnauzers typically carry themselves with a great deal of self-importance. They are agile and athletic, and excel in performance sports such as agility, tracking and herding. Highly versatile, they"re good hunters and have been used as retrievers both on land and in the water. They"re also excellent herders of sheep and cattle, one of their original jobs as an all-around farm dog. In fact, many Standard Schnauzers have earned American Kennel Club (AKC) herding titles. With their working dog heritage, they also make excellent watchdogs. Standard Schnauzers are territorial, quick to bark at any disturbance. They have a deep bark that sounds as though it should come from a much larger dog and are vigorous in carrying out their watchdog duties. Their personality is sometimes mischievous, always clever, and inevitably dignified. They learn quickly and want to please, which makes them great therapy dogs. And when socialized with children, they make an excellent and affectionate companion for the younger members of the family. The Standard Schnauzer"s highly developed senses, intelligence, trainability, courage, stamina, and resistance to adverse conditions have found many a place in a field that most would not expect — search and rescue. Many of the Standards have proven to be exceedingly good at this important work, and their smaller size enables them to search in areas that larger dogs can"t reach. Standard Schnauzers do have strong personalities, and can be stubborn. They have an uncanny way of determining your weaknesses and will take advantage of you whenever possible. If you"re not careful, they"ll rule the household; this is a breed that requires consistent and firm guidance from owners. With all of his innate skills and exceptional good looks, is it any wonder breeders felt one size was not enough? As the original model for both the Miniature and Giant Schnauzers, Standards are truly the foundation of a great legacy in dogs.
Standard Schnauzers are intelligent, but they can be stubborn. This can sometimes make them difficult to housetrain. Crate-training is recommended. Standard Schnauzers are protective of their homes and families. While they generally don"t bark without good reason, they will bark if they sense anything is threatening their homes and families. Standard Schnauzers are highly intelligent and become bored with repetitive tasks. They thrive on varied activities and exercise. Make sure you give your Standard Schnauzer both or he could become destructive and ill-tempered. Because of their intelligence and self-assurance, Standard Schnauzers will capitalize on any weaknesses in their people and could start "ruling the roost." Be consistent with your Standard Schnauzer, and make sure he knows you are the alpha dog in your house. When training, do not use harsh methods, which could make your Standard Schnauzer resentful. Schnauzers can be suspicious of strangers, including guests, until they know they are accepted by the family. Standard Schnauzers have a great deal of energy and require adequate exercise each day to prevent them from using that energy in destructive ways. Because one of their many jobs has been to catch rats, Standard Schnauzers should not be trusted with small, furry family pets, such as hamsters, guinea pigs, and gerbils. Most Standard Schnauzers seem to tolerate sharing their homes with cats, however, especially if they have been introduced to them at an early age. Standard Schnauzers are curious and fearless — a dangerous combination if you allow your dog to run off-leash in unfenced areas. Never buy a Standard Schnauzer from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Standard Schnauzer has a long history in his homeland of Germany. Based on paintings by Renaissance artists Rembrandt and Albrecht Durer, as well as a tapestry created in 1501 by Lucas Cranach the Elder, it"s evident dogs of this type have existed for several centuries. Schnauzers were used to guard farm families and livestock, herd cattle and sheep, get rid of vermin, and protect their owners as they traveled to market. German breeders took an interest in standardizing this breed in the mid-1800s. At that time, crosses were made with the gray Wolfspitz and black German Poodles to produce the distinctive texture and color of the breed"s hair. At around the same time, Standard Schnauzers were crossed with other breeds to develop first the Miniature Schnauzer and later, the Giant Schnauzer. In their early years and until the late 1800s, Standard Schnauzers were called Wirehaired Pinschers. They were first exhibited at the Third German International Show in Hanover in 1879, and the first-prize winner was a dog named Schnauzer. A breed standard was written in 1880 and the first specialty show was held at Stuttgart in 1890 with an entry of 93 dogs. By 1900, the breed was becoming known as the Schnauzer, thought to be both a reference to the breed"s unique muzzle (for which the German word is schnauze), which sports a beard and mustache, and to the name of the first winner in the show ring. The Bavarian Schnauzer Klub was formed in Munich in 1907. During World War I, the dogs were used to carry dispatches and aid Red Cross workers. They were also used in Germany for police work. Records indicate that some Standard Schnauzers were brought to the U.S. in the early 1900s by families who immigrated here, and by world travelers who fell in love with the breed in Germany. The breed wasn"t imported in great numbers, however, until after World War I. The Schnauzer Club of America was formed in 1925. In 1933, the club split to form the Standard Schnauzer Club of America (SSCA) and the American Miniature Schnauzer Club. At first, the breed was classified as a terrier in the U.S., which is how the Miniature Schnauzer continues to be organized. But Germans always regarded the Schnauzer as a working dog. So in 1945, the AKC reclassified the Standard Schnauzer and placed it in the Working group. Today, the Standard Schnauzer ranks 99th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Males are ideally between 18 to 20 inches high at the shoulder and generally weigh 35 to 50 pounds. Females are ideally between 17 and 19 inches high at the shoulder and generally weigh 30 to 45 pounds.
The dignified Standard Schnauzer has above-average intelligence and is inquisitive, creative, and sometimes stubborn in the way he thinks. It takes an equally intelligent and creative person to stay a step ahead of him and you"ll need to train him with firmness and consistency. The Standard is affectionate and protective of family members. He"s territorial and will alert you to the presence of strangers with a deep bark. Once you welcome someone into your home, however, he"ll accept them as well. He loves to be the center of attention. As with every dog, Standard Schnauzers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Standard Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Standard Schnauzers have very few health problems. Nonetheless it"s recommended that all breeding dogs be radiographed (x-rayed) clear of hip dysplasia and tested annually for eye disease. A breeder should be able to show you health clearances for both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.
The Standard Schnauzer is an adaptable dog and can live as comfortably in a city apartment as on a country farm, provided he gets enough exercise each day. Whatever his environment, he should live in the home with his people. A fenced yard is highly recommended for these dogs, who has been known to jump a six-foot fence. The Standard Schnauzer needs at least an hour of vigorous activity every day. He"s a high-energy dog, and should be walked briskly a minimum of three times a day, about 20 minutes each time. Or you could take him for two half-hour walks. Other good forms of exercise for this breed include swimming, playing fetch or Frisbee, and hiking. Begin training when your Standard Schnauzer is young, and continue to reinforce lessons throughout his life. He requires a trainer who"s patient, firm, and consistent and he responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play. Although he"s intelligent and wants you to be happy, his idea of how things should be may outweigh any desire to please.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Standard Schnauzer in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Standard Schnauzer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Standard Schnauzer"s outer coat is wiry, hard, and dense, with hairs that stand up from the skin. Beneath is a soft undercoat. On the back, the coat can be from 3/4 to 2 inches long. People tend to like to keep the coat on the ears, head, neck, chest, stomach, and under the tail closely trimmed, which means frequent trips to a groomer. Over the eyes and on the muzzle, the hair is left longer to form the eyebrows and beard. The hair on the legs is longer than that on the body. All furnishings (the longer hair on the head, legs, and tail) have a harsh texture. Soft, smooth, curly, wavy or shaggy hair that is too long or too short; an undercoat that is too sparse, and excessive or lack of furnishings are all considered faults in the show ring. Standard Schnauzers may be either pepper and salt or pure black. The pepper and salt coloring is a combination of black and white hairs, and white hairs banded with black. Pepper and salt coloring can range from dark iron gray to silver gray. Pepper and salt-colored Standard Schnauzers should have a gray undercoat, but a tan or fawn-colored undercoat is acceptable. It"s also desirable for the facial mask to be darker and to complement the coat color. Sometimes, the pepper and salt colorations fades out to a light gray or silver white in the eyebrows, whiskers, cheeks, under the throat, across the chest, under the tail, and on the legs and belly. Black Standard Schnauzers have a dark, rich color that isn"t discolored or mixed with any gray or tan hairs. The undercoat should also be black. As the dog ages or if he"s exposed to sunlight a great deal, the black may fade and become a bit discolored. Standard Schnauzers require a lot of grooming to look their best. You"ll need to brush the beard and legs daily to prevent tangles, and wash his face after every meal. A Standard Schnauzer"s coat usually must be hand-stripped every four to six months if you show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat, but pets can be clipped by your groomer. Be warned, however, that if his coat is clipped, instead of stripped, the texture will soften, and he"ll shed more. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Standard Schnauzer"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Standard Schnauzer jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Standard Schnauzer to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Sturdy and energetic, Standard Schnauzers can be loyal and affectionate companions to children. They generally get along well with children of all ages, playing gently and kindly with younger ones. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Standard Schnauzers aren"t especially fond of unknown dogs and may be aggressive toward them, but they can get along well with dogs and cats they"re raised with. Keep pet mice, rats, hamsters and similar pets safely away from him. His instinct to be a rat-catcher is still strong!

Dog Breed Group:  Sporting DogsHeight:  1 foot, 1 inch to 1 foot, 3 inches tall at the shoulderWeight:  35 to 45 poundsLife Span:  11 to 14 years
This rare and unusual spaniel with the happy tail remains true to his heritage as a hunting dog, and he"s often found in the field or participating in hunt tests. A deliberate hunter who moves at a moderate pace, he has lots of endurance and a "never give up" personality, characteristics that make him a good companion for people who might not be hunters but enjoy long walks or hikes with a nature-loving dog. If he"s not used as a hunting dog, he"ll be satisfied with such backyard prey as birds, butterflies, and insects. The Sussex stands out among spaniels for his voice. He"s vocal about letting the hunter know how he"s doing, and he carries that talkative tendency over to home life. The Sussex is likely to bark or howl at noises or visitors, so he makes a good watchdog. It"s important, however, to teach him when to stop barking so he doesn"t disturb the neighbors. Affectionate and companionable, the Sussex thrives in a home where he"s not left on his own for hours each day. He likes to follow his people around and enjoys the company of other dogs as well. A Sussex bonds strongly to family members and can become anxious and destructive if ignored. This gentle, even-tempered dog does well with children when he"s raised with them, but he"s best suited to a home with older children who understand how to interact with a dog. Sussex puppies can be injured if they"re dropped, hit or stepped on by young children, so supervision is a must. In general, Sussex Spaniels love people, but they can be possessive of their own family members, unwilling for other people to approach them. Early and frequent socialization is important to prevent this. Because of their sporting dog heritage, they usually get along well with other dogs, but if they"re not socialized to other dogs at an early age, they can be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know. The versatile Sussex is talented at many dog sports, including agility, tracking, and hunt tests, but he"s moderately challenging to train. He has what"s known as a soft personality, meaning he tends to be easygoing, but he can also be stubborn. Training a Sussex requires patience, kindness, encouragement, and a strong sense of humor. He responds well to praise and rewards but stops trying if he receives harsh corrections. Begin training as soon as you bring him home at 8 to 12 weeks of age, while he"s still amenable to training. Despite his medium size, the Sussex is strong and powerful, so it"s important for him to learn to listen to you before he becomes too hard to handle. Brush a Sussex daily to prevent mats from forming. Trim the feet and the inside of the ears monthly to keep them neat. The Sussex loves playing in water, so he"ll need a good rinse or a bath any time he goes for a swim in a stinky pond or lake, a chlorinated pool, or saltwater. To prevent ear infections, keep this breed"s floppy ears clean and dry. As a breed, the Sussex Spaniel has faced many challenges, including near extinction after World War II. It was only through the efforts of a dedicated handful of people that the breed survived. Although the Sussex is still uncommon, those who know him love him for his calm, even temper, deep howl, and social disposition.
Sussex Spaniels are known for stretching their back legs out behind them and dragging themselves forward, a behavior called kippering. It"s not a disorder and is nothing to worry about. Sussex Spaniels are barkers. Sussex Spaniels can make excellent companions for older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Sussex Spaniels are intelligent and can learn quickly, but they"re also stubborn and require a patient, consistent trainer. Sussex Spaniels need 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily to keep them fit and healthy. They enjoy walks and hikes. Sussex Spaniels can easily become overweight if their eating habits aren"t managed. Sussex Spaniels shed moderately and should be brushed two or three times a week to keep loose hair under control and to prevent tangles from forming. Sussex Spaniels dislike being left alone for long periods and can become destructive or noisy if not given enough attention and exercise. Sussex Spaniels generally get along well with other pets and dogs, but if they aren"t exposed to lots of dogs during puppyhood, they can be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know.
The Sussex Spaniel was developed at an estate called Rosehill in Sussex County, England, probably during the mid-nineteenth century. Two men are credited with shaping the Sussex Spaniel into the dog it is today. The first was Moses Woolland, who after obtaining his first Sussex Spaniels in 1882 went out and successfully bred both show and field lines. His dogs were not exactly like the Sussex of today, but they were very similar. The second is Campbell Newington, who began breeding in 1887. Newington"s dogs were also similar to the Sussex Spaniel as it is today, and together both men began breeding dogs that were consistent in type and quality. The first breed standard was written during this time. For a time, the breed thrived, but after Woolland"s death Newington was alone in his efforts to keep the Sussex Spaniel from becoming forgotten. In 1909, however, J. E. Kerr became interested in the breed and began producing litters of his own. Without the efforts of these two men, the Sussex Spaniel would have disappeared completely. After World War I, the Sussex Spaniel saw a further decline in numbers and popularity. Newington whelped his last litter in 1921 and it seemed that the Sussex Spaniel might pass into extinction, but the breed hung on by its dewclaws. The privations of World War II was another stumbling block, when breeding almost ceased in England. The breed"s survival is mostly credited to the efforts of Joy Freer, who spent 60 years breeding and perfecting her lines. The first Sussex Spaniel arrived in the United States shortly before the Great Depression and more followed a few years later, just prior to World War II, but they were unsuccessful in attracting the attention of the public. In 1969, three Sussex Spaniels were imported to the United States and after that another 11 found their way to America. They remain rare, but through an understanding of the value of these gentle and cheerful spaniels, the breed has gained a bit of a respite from the threat of endangerment. Today, the Sussex Spaniel ranks 154th among the 157 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
The Sussex Spaniel stands 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder and weighs 35 to 45 pounds.
The gentle and affectionate Sussex Spaniel is an excellent family companion. In the field, he"s full of energy and endurance, even though he"s not as fast moving as other sporting breeds. He"s friendly and cheerful but can be stubborn when it comes to training. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, a Sussex needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he"s young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sussex Spaniel puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Like all dog breeds, the Sussex is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions. While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Sussex Spaniels, it is imperative to do your research to find a Sussex who"s been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she"s taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy"s parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Sussex Spaniels: Pulmonic Stenosis: This is a congenital heart disease in which blood does not flow properly through the heart due to a narrowing of the region between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. This obstruction in the pulmonary valve causes the right side of the heart to work harder, eventually enlarging. Without treatment, it can lead to heart failure. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease and ranges from regular monitoring by a veterinarian to medication to surgery. Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA): This common congenital heart disease is found in many different breeds. It occurs when a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosis, which connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery in a fetus, doesn"t close after birth. If it remains open, blood begins to flow backward into the lungs, causing fluid to accumulate and resulting in labored breathing, fainting, dizzy spells, coughing, heart murmurs, collapse and heart failure. Patent Ductus Arteriosis can easily be corrected surgically. Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): Sussex Spaniels can be prone to back problems such as IVDD, which occurs when a disc in the spine ruptures or herniates and pushes upward into the spinal cord. This may be caused by moving or being picked up the wrong way, falling or jumping off furniture, or it can be an inherited condition. A ruptured disc is painful and can lead to weakness and temporary or permanent paralysis. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, acupuncture or chiropractic, and surgery. Hip Dysplasia: This degenerative disease occurs when the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development and is found in many breeds of dogs. It affects approximately 42 percent of Sussex Spaniels but is rarely debilitating.
The Sussex needs 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise to keep him in best condition. He"ll enjoy long walks or hikes, especially if they"re through wooded areas where he can hunt for birds. He"s a serious spaniel, not given to exuberant romps, but he enjoys spending time with his people in the great outdoors. He"s best suited to living indoors but should have access to a safely fenced yard where he can keep a watchful eye on birds, squirrels, and other wildlife. Training a Sussex can be a challenge. Members of this breed have a mind of their own. Sussex Spaniels are intelligent and learn quickly, but they need consistency and patience to see the training fully succeed. One area that needs to be addressed at a young age is barking. Unlike other spaniels, Sussex Spaniels let their voices ring out when hunting. That carries over into home life as well. They will bark when people come to the door or just for the joy of hearing it. If you don"t train your Sussex to bark in moderation, you will find yourself with a dog that barks at everything in excess. The Sussex is especially likely to bark and howl when left alone for long periods, so before acquiring one, consider whether you"ll be home frequently enough to keep him happy.
Recommended daily amount: 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Sussex Spaniels gain weight easily. To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Sussex at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he"s putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they"re buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your Sussex will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit. For more on feeding your Sussex, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Sussex Spaniel has an abundant coat that"s straight or slightly wavy but not curly. The tail and the legs down to the heel (called the hock) are adorned with moderate fringe of hair known as feathering. The ears are covered with soft, wavy hair, and the neck also has additional hair known as a frill. The coat color is a rich golden liver with no other color, markings or shades of liver. The Sussex Spaniel sheds moderately. Daily brushing helps keep the amount of loose hair to a manageable level, but you can get by with brushing the Sussex weekly. No trimming or clipping is required, but you may want to trim the hair on and around the feet to keep them looking tidy. Bathe as needed. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Sussex Spaniel"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won"t scratch your legs when your Sussex jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Sussex to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Sussex Spaniels have a calm demeanor and get along well with children, especially if they"re raised with them. As with most dogs, they"re best suited to homes with children that are at least six years old and understand how to interact with dogs. It"s never appropriate to leave dogs and young children alone together. They should always be supervised to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party. The Sussex generally gets along well with other pets, including cats, although he"s said to be a bit bossy. If Sussex aren"t socialized as pupsters, they may be aggressive toward dogs they don"t know, so don"t neglect this important stage of development. On the down side, a Sussex may be a little too interested in getting to know pet birds, if you know what we mean.

Dog Breed Group:  Herding DogsHeight:  11 inches to 1 foot, 1 inch tall at the shoulderWeight:  22 to 35 poundsLife Span:  12 to 15 years
The Swedish Vallhund is energetic, playful and loving. Even better, he knows how to make you laugh and get you through any rough times you may be facing. Vallhunds will create games to entertain themselves and their people, but it’s better if you channel their brains and activity level more formally, through training, dog sports and activities such as hiking or making therapy visits.While he sounds ideal, with his medium size, athleticism, and happy personality, the Vallhund is not a breed for everyone. He can be a barker — at door-to-door salesmen, the dog next door or the rat beneath the floor — and his energy level makes him unsuitable for a couch potato owner. But if you are an active person and experienced dog owner who enjoys hiking or long walks and will appreciate this dog’s companionship in whatever you do; he’s definitely a dog to consider.The Vallhund is friendly toward others and readily accepts attention and treats from everyone he meets. He is highly intelligent and learns quickly, responding well to positive reinforcement techniques. This versatile breed excels in performance events such as agility, flyball, herding, nose work, obedience, rally, and tracking. He also has the skills to be a valuable assistant on a farm or ranch. The official breed standard is maintained by the Swedish Vallhund Club of America. 
The Swedish Vallhund bears a strong resemblance to the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis, but genetically they do not appear to be all that closely related. A Swedish Vallhund’s tail may be long, stubby or bobbed. All tail types, natural or docked, are equally acceptable. The Vallhund has wedge-shaped head with medium-size ears that stand erect. Swedish Vallhunds do not respond well to harsh verbal or physical corrections. The Vallhund can become a nuisance barker, especially if he is frequently left alone. The Vallhund is a herding breed and may nip at children’s ankles as they run by. The Vallhund is not necessarily a good “first dog.” He requires plenty of socialization, training, and exercise to be a good companion.
The Swedish Vallhund — the name means “herding” or “shepherd” dog — is said to descend from dogs of the Vikings, but the truth is records of dog breeding don’t go back that far. What is known is they were farm dogs in Sweden, used to herd cattle and other livestock, as well as perform other tasks for the landowner such as keeping vermin down or barking an alarm.Known in their homeland as the Vastgotaspets, the dogs were first recognized as a breed by the Swedish Kennel Club in 1943. The United Kennel Club began registering the breed in 1996, and the American Kennel Club recognized it in 2007. 
The Vallhund stands 11.5 to 13.5 inches at the shoulder and weighs 22 to 35 pounds.
This is a confident, lively, and curious dog with an independent streak, but he’s loyal to his family and courageous in alerting them to the presence of any strangers or other perceived dangers. The Vallhund is calm and adaptable, making him suited to many different home environments as long as he gets plenty of daily exercise. He loves his people and wants to be with them as much as possible.Count on the Vallhund to keep you entertained. He is described as having a sense of humor and is clever at problem-solving or simply finding new uses for his toys.The Vallhund’s watchful nature makes him a great alarm dog. He also likes to bark just to let you know he’s in a good mood or to “chat” with you about your day. Teach him to limit his number of barks or to “speak” only on command so that he doesn’t disturb the neighbors.Begin training the Vallhund at an early age. He’s smart and loves to learn, especially if you make it fun for him. Show him what you want in a kind manner and be consistent to establish your leadership. Don’t be surprised if he “tests” you to see if you really mean what you say.The Vallhund is a herding breed, and it’s instinctive for him to nip at fast-moving objects. That’s not acceptable when he’s grabbing at a child’s pants leg, however, or chasing a bicyclist or kid on a skateboard. Correct this behavior with a stern “No” every time you see it. He will quickly learn which types of play are acceptable and which ones aren’t.Like every dog, the Vallhund needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Some Vallhunds can be shy or anxious and need extra attention to become good family dogs. Socialization helps to ensure that your Vallhund puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog, unafraid of strangers, children, other animals or being left alone when necessary.
Swedish Vallhunds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Vallhunds will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.Expect breeders to have up-to-date health clearances certifying that a puppy’s parents are free of eye disease and hip dysplasia. Clearances should be in the form of an eye exam by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist with the results registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and an OFA or Pennhip evaluation of the hips. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website or the website of the Canine Health Information Center. Retinopathy is a hereditary eye disease that is known to affect the Swedish Vallhund. It causes degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells and may lead to complete vision loss.  
The Vallhund’s short legs belie his agility and speed. He corners like a race car and is an excellent agility competitor. He is sturdy and muscular and packs a big punch for his size.As a herding breed, he is bred to move flocks long distances. Even if he doesn’t do that for a living anymore, he still needs daily exercise in the form of a long walk or hike or training for a dog sport such as agility. If he gets the activity he needs, the Vallhund is happy in any environment, from city condo to country estate.With his short legs and long back, the Vallhund can be prone to back injuries if mishandled. Because their skeletal development is not yet complete, avoid letting puppies jump on and off furniture. Don’t pick them up without supporting both the front legs and the rear end.The Vallhund has a weather-resistant coat designed to withstand the harsh elements of Sweden, but that doesn’t mean he’s an outside dog. He is highly people-oriented and should never be shunted off to the backyard with little human interaction.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Vallhund in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Vallhund, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Vallhund is a double-coated Spitz breed with medium-length hair. The undercoat is soft and dense, protected by a harsh topcoat. A woolly, curly or fluffy coat is not correct for the show ring and can be more of a hassle to groom, but it doesn’t affect a Vallhund’s ability to be a great companion.The coat comes in a sable pattern of gray to red or combinations of colors in various shades. Ideally, the dog has a mask of lighter hair around the eyes, on the muzzle and under the throat; lighter shades on the chest, belly, rear end, lower legs and feet; and darker hair on the back, neck and sides. The breed stands out for light-colored “harness markings” on the back.A Vallhund’s coat doesn’t need any special trimming. In fact, a Vallhund in the show ring is meant to appear in an untrimmed, natural state.Give the Vallhund a thorough brushing every week. Get all the way down to the skin to remove dead hair and stimulate the sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance that lubricates and protects hair and skin.Brush your Vallhund’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced at trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Check ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Vallhund to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Vallhunds usually love children, but their herding instincts can motivate them to nip at a youngster’s feet or ankles. They can learn quickly, however, that this behavior is not permitted.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Vallhunds are usually friendly toward other pets in the household, including cats, so long as they have been socialized with them from an early age. They enjoy having a second or third dog in the family to play with, especially another Vallhund.
Some Vallhunds, purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one or given up because their families can no longer keep them, are in need of adoption or fostering. Contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Vallhund rescue organization.

With his noble appearance, long coat, appealing colors, and beautiful tail, the Tibetan Mastiff is sure to be a conversation starter and traffic stopper as you walk him down the street. But if that"s all you"re looking for in a dog, this is not the breed for you.   Before considering the drawbacks, here"s what we love about this breed. The Tibetan Mastiff is loving, gentle, patient, and understanding. His centuries of working closely with humans have made him very sophisticated in the ways he understands people. He"s a hard worker, protective of his family, fearless, and loyal. His large size and substance makes him a wonderful guard dog, and centuries of breeding for that specific task has perfected him as a protector. As attractive as that sounds, it"s essential to weigh carefully the other qualities that can make him a challenging proposition. This is an independent guardian breed who will not always look to you for guidance. He will enjoy your company and bond with you, but he won"t always obey you, especially in a situation in which he believes he"s right. The Tibetan Mastiff is stubborn and usually doesn"t do well in obedience or agility competitions. Tibetan Mastiffs are generally quiet dogs when their needs and living conditions are met, but if left outdoors at night they can be barkers. Of course there"s an easy solution: bring your dog inside. If you use a yard, make sure it"s well-fenced; Tibetan Mastiffs have been known to climb fences to escape. And be sure not to leave these dogs outside for very long because they may start to dig and become territorial and aggressive.   Under certain conditions, Tibetan Mastiffs are tolerant with children in their own families, especially if raised with them. But they"re generally not well suited to homes with young children. Tibetan Mastiffs can mistake the yelling, screaming, and playing of visiting children as a sign of aggression and often won"t allow your child"s friends to come visit. This territorial drive can affect not only your children"s social life but also your own. If you are a social person with many people coming and going, this breed is probably not for you, as the Tibetan Mastiff may try to limit the number of people allowed into the house. Socialization is essential for this breed. It"s important to take your Tibetan Mastiff puppy and adult dog to as many dog-friendly stores, parks, and events as possible. Let him meet new people, but understand if he"s wary of specific people. Tibetan Mastiffs have a strong instinct concerning people, and if they don"t get over their initial dislike of a particular person, there"s usually a reason. Tibetan Mastiffs cannot be walked off leash and should be taken on several different routes during their daily walks to prevent them from becoming territorial of their walking route. The Tibetan Mastiff can be a wonderful breed for the proper owner and home, but he can"t fit into just any lifestyle. If you"re interested in this breed, do your homework and talk to breeders and other Tibetan Mastiff owners.    One thing is certain: if you do acquire a Tibetan Mastiff, your life is sure to be an interesting adventure with this beautiful, loyal companion.    
Be mindful the your small, cute teddy bear of a puppy will grow into a 75 to 160 pound dog. The Mastiff"s size makes him unsuited for apartment living. Tibetan Mastiffs are usually active in the morning and evening. If your schedule doesn"t allow you to exercise them during these times, this may not be the breed for you. They are generally calm indoors. The Tibetan Mastiff should not be left to live outside. He"s a companion dog and thrives in the presence of his family. Because of his protective nature, a Tibetan Mastiff should never be walked off leash. Vary his walks so he doesn"t become territorial over a specific route. Tibetan Mastiffs are highly intelligent, independent, and stubborn, yet sensitive to human moods. They will become upset if you yell at or discipline your children or argue with your spouse. They enjoy your company but are never fawning. This is not the breed for people who wish to compete in dog sports such as agility or obedience. Tibetan Mastiffs who are left outdoors at night will bark to let you know they"re on the job — so don"t leave them outdoors at night. On the upside, they are generally quiet during the day. Tibetan Mastiffs shed little, except for once a year. a They require weekly brushing, except during their seasonal shed, when they should be brushed more frequently. The Tibetan Mastiff needs early socialization that should continue throughout his life. Without it, he can be inappropriately aggressive toward dogs and people he doesn"t know. Socialization helps him learn discrimination, which is essential for a guardian breed. The Tibetan Mastiff is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. The Tibetan Mastiff is strong-willed and will test whether you really mean what you say. Tibetan Mastiffs can become bored without proper physical and mental stimulation. This can lead to destructiveness, barking, and other negative behaviors. If you"re interested in owning a Tibetan Mastiff, please bear in mind that you"ll lose at least a few items to his sharp teeth before he reaches three years of age. Tibetan Mastiffs can do well with children if they"re raised with them, but they can mistake the yelling, screaming, and playing of children as a sign of aggression that requires action on their part. They may not warm up to neighborhood kids. They are not recommended for homes with young children. Never buy a Tibetan Mastiff from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases and of sound temperament.
The Tibetan Mastiff originated, where else, in Tibet. Like so many breeds, he has little documented history from before the late 19th century, but he"s believed to have been around for many centuries. DNA evidence tells us that mastiff-type dogs originated in Tibet some 5,000 years ago, and the Tibetan Mastiff is no doubt a descendant of those dogs. They developed into two types: the Do-Khyi, who lived in villages or traveled with nomadic shepherds and functioned as flock guardians, and the larger Tsang-Khyi, which were often given to lamaseries, where they served as guardians for the Tibetan Buddhist monks, or lamas, who lived there. Little is known of the Tibetan Mastiff before 1800. In 1800, a Captain Samuel Turner mentioned the use of "huge dogs" in his memoir, An account of an Embassy to the Court of the Teshoo Lama in Tibet, but he gave no description of them. In 1847, the first dog from Tibet was imported to England and given to Queen Victoria as a gift from Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy of India. In 1873, England"s Kennel Club was formed and the Tibetan Mastiff was officially entered into the Stud Book as the Tibetan Mastiff, leaving its earlier title as "large dog from Tibet" behind. In 1874, the Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII, imported two more Tibetan Mastiffs to England and they were shown in 1875 at the Alexandra Palace Show. Tibetan Mastiffs continued to be imported occasionally into England and Europe, and the first Tibetan Mastiff breed club was formed in 1931. World War II put an end to breeding, and it wasn"t until 1976 that English breeders began importing the dogs again. The breed had a similar history in the United States. The late 1950s saw two Tibetan Mastiffs given to the President of the United States, but the dogs were taken to a farm and vanished from public scrutiny. It wasn"t until 1970 that several more Tibetan Mastiffs were imported into the United States and they became the foundation dogs of the United States line. The Tibetan Mastiff Club of America was founded in 1974, as was the American Tibetan Mastiff Association. The first show that the Tibetan Mastiffs appeared in was the first National Specialty Match in October 1979. The breed was only recently recognized by the American Kennel Club as a member of the Working Group in January 2007. Today, in Tibet, it"s difficult to find a purebred Tibetan Mastiff, but occasionally one can be found traveling with caravans and traders, and guarding livestock and homes.
A male Tibetan Mastiff stands at least 26 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs in the vicinity of 100 to 160 or more pounds; females are at least 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 75 to 125 or more pounds.
The word "challenging" is frequently applied to this independent, stubborn breed. He"s intelligent and has a strong sense of self, expecting to be treated as an equal, not as a pet. He wants to please his people, but he also has his own agenda and must often be reminded of what he"s been asked to do. The Tibetan Mastiff is a loyal family guardian who takes his job seriously and is aloof or reserved toward strangers. Early socialization that continues throughout his life will help prevent him from becoming territorially aggressive. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Tibetan Mastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all TMs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It"s thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog"s elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain. Panosteitis: Panosteitis can best be described as canine growing pains. It"s an inflammation of the long bones that affects young, large-breed dogs and causes lameness, which often shifts from leg to leg. The condition usually lasts from one to six months and eventually resolves with maturity. Any discomfort can be managed with pain medication. Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the shoulder, but may also affect the elbow. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint and can be detected in dogs as early as five to seven months of age. It may require surgical repair. Because it appears to be a hereditary condition, dogs with OCD should not be bred. Canine Inherited Demyelinative Neuropathy (CIDN): This is an inherited condition that is found in Tibetan Mastiff puppies by the time they are six weeks of age. The condition affects the nervous system and causes weakness in the rear legs that eventually progresses to complete paralysis. There is no treatment, but selective breeding has greatly reduced the incidence of CIDN. Autoimmune Hypothyroidism: This common endocrine disorder, which usually affects middle-aged and older dogs, is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone. Signs include weight gain, flaky skin, and lack of energy. Once diagnosed, hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tibetan Mastiffs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old.
The Tibetan Mastiff is a companion dog who should live indoors, with access to a large, securely fenced yard where he can exercise. A small yard or dog run isn"t sufficient for his needs. His heavy coat makes him unsuited to life in a hot, humid climate, although he can tolerate dry heat. During hot weather, he should always have access to shade and fresh water whenever he"s outdoors. The Tibetan Mastiff"s exercise requirements can be satisfied with 20 to 30 minutes of play in the yard or a half-hour walk. He"ll enjoy having another dog to play with, preferably one who comes close to his size. Tibetan Mastiff puppies grow more quickly than smaller breeds, but they aren"t physically mature until they"re more than a year old. To prevent orthopedic damage, limit exercise to free play in the yard, and avoid long walks until your puppy is a year old. Begin training the day you bring your Tibetan Mastiff puppy home. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but their independent and stubborn nature means that strict and formal obedience training doesn"t bring the best results. Be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Tibetan Mastiff. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Tibetan Mastiff is more destructive and noisy than you can imagine. Housetraining comes easily to the Tibetan Mastiff. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your puppy from chewing on things he shouldn"t or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren"t around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he"s feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment. Leash training is also important, especially since your Tibetan Mastiff will eventually weigh up to 160 pounds or more and be able to pull you where he wants to go. Tibetan Mastiffs should never be walked off leash and having good leash manners is essential to both the state of your muscles and your happiness. Socialization is a must for this breed. Not only can Tibetan Mastiffs be overly dominant toward other dogs, they tend to become overly protective of their home and family. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn"t end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. Invite different people to your home on multiple occasions so your Tibetan Mastiff learns that others can come onto your property and his territory. With the proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Tibetan Mastiff can be a wonderful family member who guards, protects, and loves you unconditionally.
Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 or more cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Tibetan Mastiff in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Tibetan Mastiff, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Tibetan Mastiff has a double coat with a long, thick, coarse-textured topcoat and a heavy, soft, woolly undercoat. The undercoat is thinner during warmer months. The hair is hard and straight, never curly, wavy, or silky. A heavy mane covers the neck and shoulders, and the tail and britches (the upper thighs) have a heavy coat and feathering. Males generally have more coat than females, including a thicker mane around the neck and shoulders. The coat comes in black, brown, gold, and blue, with or without tan markings above and around the eyes, on the side of the muzzle, on the throat, and on the lower part of the front forelegs, the inside of the rear legs, the breeches and the underside of the tail. Some Tibetan Mastiffs have small white markings on the chest and feet but nowhere else on the body. The undercoat may be lighter shades of the dominant color or gray or tan on black and tan dogs. Tibetan Mastiffs with sable or brindle coats are faulted in the show ring, but their color doesn"t affect their ability to be a companion or guardian. The Tibetan Mastiff sheds little and may or may not shed seasonally, depending on the climate in which he lives. Brush him one to three times a week with a wire slicker brush to remove dead or loose hair. Be sure to check for tangles or mats in the mane, breeches, and tail, where the coat is heaviest. Bathe as needed. This breed has little odor, so he usually doesn"t require a bath more than once a month. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Mastiff"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don"t get caught in the carpet and tear. If the feet need to be tidied up with trimming, the best time to do it is when you are clipping the nails. Check the ears weekly to make sure there"s no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog"s breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don"t stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Begin getting your Tibetan Mastiff used to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Tibetan Mastiff is suitable for families with older children, but he can be too large to safely spend much time around toddlers. He would never mean to hurt them, but he could easily knock them over or step on them. Make it a rule that children are never to run and scream in a Tibetan Mastiff"s presence. The noise and activity can excite him, and he"s simply too big to be allowed to chase children or play roughly with them. He may also feel the need to protect "his" children from other kids, especially if they"re wrestling or otherwise appear to be fighting. Always supervise play so that he knows you"re in charge. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Tibetan Mastiffs get along well with other dogs and cats when they"re raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the advent of another dog.

The Tibetan Spaniel is a small dog with a long history. Bred in Tibetan Buddhist lamaseries to be companions and alarm dogs, they were popular gifts to foreign dignitaries. Today the little canine ambassadors are still prized as companions, thanks to their sweet, smart, and attentive nature. Said to resemble a little lion, a powerful Buddhist symbol, he retains the watchfulness bred into him centuries ago and can be aloof toward strangers, but he"s a fond and friendly family companion. Tibbies, as they"re nicknamed, are active enough to enjoy dog sports such as agility, but not so demanding of exercise that they"ll run you ragged. Their portable size makes them suited to any home, from apartment to estate, as long as they have plenty of human attention. When they"re not cuddling with their people, Tibbies enjoy a high perch that allows them to see everything that"s going on. They"ll climb on whatever piece of furniture gives them the best view, giving them the reputation of being catlike. Like many small dogs, they prefer being approached at their own level rather than having someone looming over them. They"re highly intelligent and take well to training when it"s accompanied by positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Tibetan Spaniels are sensitive to the moods and needs of their families and they"re happy to try and meet them. This loving breed is uncommon, but he"s the ideal match for the right homes.
Although Tibetan Spaniels can learn quickly, they may be stubborn when it comes to obeying commands. Tibetan Spaniels shed small amounts year-round and need weekly brushing to get rid of dead hair. Although Tibetan Spaniels are affectionate toward and protective of children, they"re better suited for homes with older children because they can be injured during rough play. Tibetan Spaniels generally get along well with other dogs and pets. They do well in homes with multiple dogs. Tibetan Spaniels thrive when they"re with their families. They"re not recommended for homes where they"ll receive little attention or will be left alone for long periods. Barking can become a favorite pastime of Tibetan Spaniels if they"re bored. They"ll also bark when people come to the door or when they hear something suspicious. The upside is, they make great watchdogs. Tibetan Spaniels only need moderate exercise and are quite happy with a daily walk or free play in a fenced yard. Tibetan Spaniels must be walked on leash to prevent them from running off to explore. Yards should be fenced. The Tibetan Spaniel is fairly rare, so if you"re buying a puppy, it may take a while to find a good breeder, and once you do, there may be a wait for puppies to be available. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
The Tibetan Spaniel is an ancient breed from Asia. Depictions of small dogs with pushed-in faces and lionlike coats date back centuries in China and Tibet. It"s believed that Buddhist monks, known as lamas, bred the little dogs to sound the alarm if anyone approached the lamasery. With the ruff of thick fur around their neck and the richly plumed tail, they were said to resemble little lions. In Buddhist symbology, lions represent Buddha"s triumph over violence and aggression, so dogs with a lionlike appearance were popular. The dogs were frequently given as gifts to ambassadors and other notables, with dogs from those countries being received in return. Thus the Tibetan dogs made their way to the courts of China and Japan, where they no doubt interbred with other small Asian dogs. Today"s Tibetan Spaniel probably shares a common ancestry with the Japanese Chin and the Pekingese. Often bred by Tibetan villagers as well as lamas, early dogs of this type came in a wide range of sizes. The smallest, most prized puppies were given to the lamaseries where they were probably bred with the more elegant dogs that arrived as gifts from China. During the late 19th century, the first Tibetan Spaniel was brought to England by Mrs. McLaren Morris. More arrived in the 1920s, courtesy of Dr. Agnes R. H. Greig, who sent some of the dogs to her mother. The breed gained some popularity, but its foothold in England was almost completely wiped out during World War II. In 1947, after several successful breedings and importations, the breed began to recover in England. In 1958, The Tibetan Spaniel Association was formed and in 1960 England"s Kennel Club recognized the breed. The first known litter in the United States was born in 1965, to parents imported from Tibet by a Mr. Harrington. Thanks to Leo Kearns, sexton of Trinity Lutheran Church in New Haven, Connecticut, the Tibetan Spaniel began attracting notice. Kearns had a Tibbie puppy, and his parishioners were quite taken with her. He imported a male, and the puppies the two dogs produced were soon placed in doting homes. Among those enthusiastic new owners was Mrs. Jay Child, who made it her mission to see the breed established in the U. S. The Tibetan Spaniel Club of America was founded in 1971, with Child as president. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1984. Despite his charm, the Tibetan Spaniel is still pretty rare, ranking 101st in popularity among the breeds and varieties registered by the American Kennel Club.
Tibetan Spaniels stand about 10 inches high at the shoulder and weigh 9 to 15 pounds.
Trusting and affectionate toward family members, Tibetan Spaniels may be aloof toward strangers, although never aggressive. True to their heritage, they make excellent watchdogs and will bark to alert you of anything that seems unusual. Tibbies seem to be especially responsive to their people"s moods and feelings. As loving as they are, however, they"re independent thinkers and won"t always obey, especially if they think they know better or don"t see any good reason to do as you ask. As with all dogs, Tibetan Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tibetan Spaniel puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Tibetan Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain conditions. Not all Tibetan Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog"s been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Tibetan Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have their dogs eyes certified on a yearly basis. Patellar Luxation, also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.
Tibbies are housedogs. They thrive on spending time with their people, and they"re not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel. Because they may run off to explore, yards must be fenced and they should be walked on leash. Intelligent and willing to please, Tibetan Spaniels can be easy to train, but that doesn"t necessarily mean they"ll always listen to you. They have a mind of their own and will ignore commands if they don"t feel like obeying. For best results, begin training early and be consistent. Some Tibetan Spaniels are yappy and some aren"t, but they"ll generally bark when someone comes to the door or when they hear or see anyone or anything unusual. With patience and consistency, you can teach them to stop barking after they"ve briefly sounded the alarm. If you live in an apartment with noise restrictions, however, this may not be the breed for you. Like all dogs, the Tibetan Spaniel needs reguar exercise, but he doesn"t need a ton of it. Usually a good playtime in the backyard or one or two walks in a day will fit the bill. Tibetan Spaniels are generally easy to housetrain, but crate training is strongly recommended. It will make housetraining easier and keep your Tibetan Spaniel from chewing things while you"re not there to supervise. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don"t keep your Tibetan Spaniel locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Tibetan Spaniel is with you.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Tibetan Spaniel in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Tibetan Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Tibetan Spaniel has a silky double coat that"s smooth on the face and the front of the legs and moderately long on the rest of the body. The ears, tail, and backs of the forelegs and buttocks have longer hair, and a mane of long hair (sometimes referred to as a shawl) surrounds the neck. The Tibbie"s coat can be any color or mixture of colors. Weekly brushing will keep your Tibetan Spaniel"s coat free of loose hair. Expect them to shed small amounts year-round, with a heavier shed once or sometimes twice a year. Bathe them as needed, usually every 6 to 8 weeks. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Spaniel"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don"t get caught in the carpet and tear, and don"t scratch your legs when your Tibetan Spaniel enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Start grooming your Tibetan Spaniel when he"s a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Tibetan Spaniels are affectionate and protective of children, but because they"re small, they can be injured easily by rough handling, so they"re best suited to homes with children who are at least 6 years old and know to be gentle and not to tease. As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Tibetan Spaniel, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party. Tibetan Spaniels usually get along well with other dogs and cats. Most enjoy having another dog as a companion.

Born in Tibet, Tibetan Terriers were bred in lamaseries to be companions not only to the holy men who raised them but also to nomadic herdsmen as they wandered the high plains with their flocks. The shaggy, medium-size dogs were thought to bring good luck, so they were never sold but only given as gifts or thanks for favors. People who live with the breed today understand just what a gift they are.The breed"s name is a bit of a misnomer, as the Tibetan Terrier is not a true terrier at all. He was given the name on account of his size, but he doesn"t share the terrier"s tendency to go to ground (dig for vermin) or the typically sharp-edged terrier temperament. Lively and fun loving, he is, but those characteristics are tempered with a sweet and kind nature. Beneath a fall of hair, his eyes twinkle with good humor.Like all dogs, Tibetan Terriers thrive on human companionship. It"s no wonder they excel as therapy dogs. While they"re not demons for activity, they are active enough to compete in agility and do well in obedience and rally. Hearkening back to their history as lamasery alarm dogs, they are alert to anything different and make super watchdogs. Their gentle demeanor doesn"t suit them to work as guard dogs, however.It"s not unusual for Tibetan Terriers to be reserved with strangers, but they shower affection on their people. They can adapt to life in many different types of households and are a good choice for families with older children who understand how to treat dogs. With their protective double coat and large, flat, round feet to provide traction — in much the same way as snowshoes — they"re well suited to homes in snowy climates.The Tibetan Terrier is a pleasant dog who enjoys life and loves people. He"ll adapt to life with a couch potato or an active family, always approaching every day with an endearing sense of humor and a sparkle in his eye.
Tibetan Terriers are wonderful family dogs but are best suited for homes with school-age children who know how to treat a dog properly. Tibetan Terriers generally do well with dogs and other pets, especially if they have been raised with them. The Tibetan Terrier requires frequent brushing and a bath at least once per month. Tibetan Terriers make great watchdogs and will bark when they see or hear anything unusual. If they get daily exercise, Tibetan Terriers can do well in apartments or condos. Tibetan Terriers thrive on human companionship and do best in homes where they get plenty of attention and aren"t left alone for long periods. Barking is a favorite pastime for a Tibetan Terrier. He"ll bark when people come to the door, when he sees or hears something unusual, or just out of boredom. Tibetan Terriers require daily exercise and will enjoy a couple of 15-minute walks or one longer walk. The Tibetan Terrier can be easy to train with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.
With its mountainous terrain, Tibet is sometimes referred to as the Roof of the World. It was in that harsh, high, remote land that the Tibetan Terrier was created. Prized as companions, the dogs were raised by Buddhist monks, known as lamas, from whom they took their name Holy Dog. But the shaggy, medium-size dogs weren"t limited to life in the lamaseries where they were born. Considered to be luck bringers, they traveled the high plateaus with nomadic herdsmen, guarding their tents. Fearful of tempting fate by "selling" their luck, neither the lamas nor the herdsmen ever sold the dogs. Instead, they were given as gifts in return for favors or services or presented to officials as a mark of esteem.The Tibetan Terrier might have remained an obscure breed if not for a grateful Tibetan man who gave a Tibetan Terrier to Dr. Agnes R. H. Greig, who had saved his wife"s life. Dr. Greig named her new puppy Bunti and became a fan of the breed. Eventually, she acquired a male, also as a gift, and began a breeding program, establishing the Lamleh line of Tibetan Terriers. Being neither a sporting dog nor a mix, the breed was given the name Tibetan Terrier, despite the fact that it wasn"t a true terrier in either instinct or temperament but merely resembled one in size.A breed standard was created by the Kennel Club of India in 1930, and the Tibetan Terrier was officially recognized by England"s Kennel Club in 1937. The first Tibetan Terrier imported into the United States, Gremlin Cortina, arrived in 1956. Owned by Dr. Henry S. and Alice Murphy, she was so beloved by them that she inspired Alice Murphy to establish her own kennel, Lamleh of Kalai. The Tibetan Terrier Club of America was formed in 1957, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1973. Today the Tibetan Terrier ranks 95th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
Tibetan Terriers stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder and weigh 20 to 24 pounds.
The Tibetan Terrier is smart, pleasant, and affectionate. Gentle but fun loving, he"s dedicated to his family but may be cautious or reserved toward strangers. Puppies are active and lively — what puppy isn"t? — but settle down as they reach maturity.True to their heritage, they make wonderful watchdogs and will bark an alert if they see or hear anything suspicious. They don"t like to be left alone for long periods, preferring the company of the people they love. Tibetan Terriers are known for adaptability and a sense of humor.Like every dog, Tibetan Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tibetan Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Tibetan Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Lens Luxation is an inherited disorder in which the lens is improperly positioned in the eye. The displacement can be partial or complete. It"s sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed. Hip Dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn"t fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn"t be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help.
Tibetan Terriers are adaptable dogs at home in a variety of households, from condos to castles. They should live indoors with their people, not stuck out in a backyard or kennel.Once they"ve matured, they are just as happy being couch potatoes as they are active family dogs. Like any dog, an adult Tibetan Terrier requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy, but he"ll be satisfied with a couple of 15-minute walks daily or one longer walk. Naturally, puppy and adolescent Tibetan Terriers are filled with energy and excitement and require higher levels of stimulation and exercise.Although it"s nice for a Tibetan Terrier to have a securely fenced yard where he can play, it"s not a great idea to leave him out there for long periods. A bored Tibetan Terrier is a barker, and a really bored Tibetan Terrier is an escape artist who"s perfectly capable of climbing, jumping, or digging his way over or under a fence.Housetraining can take time, but you"ll be successful if you"re patient and give your Tibetan Terrier a regular schedule and plenty of opportunities to potty outdoors, praising him when he does so. Crate training is strongly recommended. It will make housetraining easier and keep your Tibetan Terrier from chewing things while you are away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don"t keep your Tibetan Terrier locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Tibetan Terrier is with you.TTs are generally amiable, but sometimes they have their own agenda. Keep training fun, be consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.
Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Tibetan Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Tibetan Terrier is protected by a double coat: a soft, woolly undercoat and an abundant topcoat with fine hair that can be wavy or straight. The long hair stops just short of the ground, enough that you can see light beneath the dog"s body. The hair often falls in a natural part along the spine. The Tibetan Terrier comes in a range of colors and patterns, including white, gold, tricolor, brindle, silver, black, and more.That long coat requires daily brushing during adolescence as the coat changes to keep it free of tangles. Once the adult coat has come in, by approximately 18 months of age, you can get by with grooming one to three times a week. Grooming tools you"ll need include a pin brush, a metal "greyhound" comb, ear powder, and a spray bottle for misting the coat.Mist the coat with a mixture of water and conditioner as you brush to avoid damaging the hair. Be sure to brush all the way down to the skin. Simply running the brush over the top of the coat won"t ensure that you find and remove any mats or tangles. Check frequently for mats behind the ears, on the chest and belly, and at the areas where the legs and tail intersect with the body. Using ear powder to make the hair less slippery, pluck excess hair in the ears, and trim the hair between the footpads. After you"re finished brushing, go over the coat with the comb to remove any loose or dead hair. You can also use it for the hair on the face.If all this grooming becomes too much for you, it"s kinder and less work to keep your TT in a cute puppy clip. You"ll both be happier. Whatever his coat length, you"ll probably want to bathe your Tibetan Terrier at least monthly. He may need a bath more often if he plays outside frequently and gets dirty.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Terrier"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar build-up and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don"t get caught in the carpet and tear, and don"t scratch your legs when your Tibetan Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Tibetan Terrier to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
Tibetan Terriers love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but they"re a little rambunctious for households with children under the age of 6 years.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tibetan Terriers usually get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they"re introduced to them in puppyhood.

The Toy Fox Terrier (TFT) was developed in the United States, making him one of only a few breeds that are truly "All American." He was created from small Smooth Fox Terriers bred with several toy breeds — including Chihuahuas and Manchester Terriers — to set breed size. He"s a true terrier, with fire, heart and spirit to go out in the field hunting squirrel, and a true toy dog, a diminutive, loving companion who will curl up on the sofa and watch TV with his people. Toy Fox Terriers are highly intelligent. They housetrain easily as puppies and their small size makes them suited to using a canine litter box or housetraining pad. Obedience and other canine activities come easily to them as well, perhaps a vestige of their heritage. TFTs did acrobatics, walked tightropes and performed other circus dog tricks in the small dog and pony shows that once traveled the country. Today, they are shown in conformation and do quite well in obedience and agility trials, rally, and flyball. A hardy breed, Toy Fox Terriers can be expected to live into their teens, remaining active into old age. Toy Fox Terriers are extremely loyal to and protective of their family. They make excellent watchdogs with a large bark that belies their size. They are persistent in their protection efforts, making smart burglars decide to take on a less noisy target. This dog bonds tightly with his family and demands to be included in all activities. Sometimes you might question whether the Toy Fox Terrier considers himself a dog. He has abundant energy and is eager to please, but has a mind of his own that makes him insist on rights and privileges given to other family members, such as sleeping on the bed. His intense loyalty to his family can make him aloof with strangers, but socialization and training to accept strangers should help your dog to realize there is no danger from visitors you allow in your home. The Toy Fox Terrier until recently had been only a recognized breed in the United Kennel Club (UKC), but the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) have now granted registration and full show status to the breed. This will give the TFT many more opportunities to gain fans and admirers for his lively disposition, loyalty, spirit, and intelligence, not to mention his sleek good looks. People who have been owned by this breed feel that their family is not complete without one around.
The Toy Fox Terrier is not a suitable companion for all children. While a sturdy little dog, they cannot tolerate excessive rough handling, especially as they are prone to broken legs. Terrier instinct may cause it to chase small animals, and thereby will need close supervision if outdoors off-leash with out a fence. Your dog should never be off-leash in an area where you cannot contain him should the need arise. Being terriers they may not do well with smaller pets in the household such as hamsters, mice and gerbils. They are a small dog but do not realize this; they sometimes challenge other dogs much larger than themselves. Supervised interaction with larger dogs is advisable. Beneath the cute exterior of your TFT puppy can reside the heart of a tyrant. Be sure to train your puppy early to be a responsible and well-behaved member of your family. Most Toy Fox Terriers would prefer to share your bed with you. However, jumping from such heights, especially when a puppy, can cause broken bones. Teaching your TFT to sleep in his own bed on the floor is a safer route. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Terrier breeds have been documented in England as far back as the 1500s. One of those breeds was the Smooth Fox Terrier, developed to rout foxes from their dens during the hunt. The Smooth Fox Terrier had always been widely divergent in size, with some dogs weighing about 20 pounds while others were as small as 7 pounds. These runts were often more prized than the larger dogs as they seemed to be feistier and more willing to jump into the fray whether it be ratting, hunting other game or defending the homestead. The United Kennel Club began to register Smooth Fox Terriers in 1912. The smaller dogs were registered along with the larger ones as Smooth Fox Terriers. In the mid- 1920s, fanciers of the smaller dogs petitioned the UKC to make the smaller dogs a separate breed, which was finally accomplished in 1936. The breed was registered as the Toy Fox Terrier. The TFT was granted American Kennel Club recognition in 2003. For many years there was a debate among breeders regarding size, some wanted a larger dog; others wanted the dog to remain a toy. Some fanciers introduced Toy Manchester and Chihuahua blood into the breed to help fix the size. This move upset other breeders who did not want the contamination of other breeds in the gene pool. The UKC agreed that the dog should remain a toy and that other breeds should not be introduced into the gene pool. The Toy Fox Terrier stud book was closed by the UKC on August 31, 1960 so no more crossing of breeds could be done.
The AKC standard defines size by height. Height should be between 8.5 to 11.5 inches with 9 to 11 inches preferred. Weight ranges from about 3.5 to 7 pounds.
Loyal, protective, and smart, the TFT loves his people and wants to be involved in everything they do. He"s a superb watchdog and will alert you to the approach of guests and strangers, as well as to all the goings-on in the neighborhood. Personalities vary, ranging from couch potato to live wire. As with every dog, the TFT needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your TFT puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Toy Fox Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all TFTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In TFTs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Demodectic Mange: This is a skin disease caused by a microscopic parasitic mite. All dogs have Demodectic mites in small numbers in their hair follicles. In some dogs, the mites proliferate and large numbers inhabit the hair and skin causing the dog to have a moth eaten appearance. Demodectic mange may be localized in one or two spots or generalized over the entire body. Juvenile onset Demodicosis generally occurs in dogs 3 to 13 months of age. The first sign is a thinning of the hair around the eyelids, lips, corners of the mouth and the front legs. It is sometimes confused with ringworm. Adult onset Demodicosis occurs in dogs more than 5 years old and can be associated with internal disease or cancer. Patellar Luxation: This is a dislocation of the kneecap (patella). It may dislocate to the inside (medial) or the outside (lateral) of the leg or it may go both directions. It can be congenital (present at birth) or caused by an injury. Patellar luxation can be mild with few or no symptoms or severe with intense pain and limping. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, it can be confused with hip dysplasia. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is due to aseptic death of the head of the femur. This causes wearing and promotes arthritic changes, at which point it can be difficult to distinguish if the damage was due to hip dysplasia or Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease. Von Willebrand"s Disease (VWD): Canine von Willebrand"s Disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Affected dogs are more likely to bleed abnormally, similar to symptoms of hemophilia. This can lead to life threatening situations in case of accidental injury, spaying, or neutering. Because it is a recessive genetic disorder, carriers will not show signs of the disease but if bred to another carrier will pass the disorder to their offspring. Congenital Hypothyroidism with Goiter (CHG): Affected puppies do not move around as much as normal pups, and their head may appear large in comparison with their body. If they survive as long as three weeks, the eyes do not open, the ear canal remains very small, and the hair coat is abnormally bristly. By two weeks of age, a swelling on the underside of the neck can be felt and it continues to enlarge. Delay in lengthening of bones in legs, spine and face causes dwarfism. Eventually, even with treatment, the goiter constricts the airway. Affected puppies usually die or are euthanized by the age of 3 weeks. Carrier status does not affect the pet that is spayed/neutered. It is only when breeding that carrier dogs pass the disease to their puppies.
Toy Fox Terriers do well in smaller living spaces such as apartments. They need little space to exercise adequately. They are definitely housedogs; they do not have the coat to live outdoors. That said, they love to explore the outdoors but should be leashed or properly supervised to prevent them getting into trouble. Their big dog attitude can often cause them to attempt to tangle with animals much larger than themselves.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Toy Fox Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The coat of a Toy Fox Terrier is short, fine and smooth, slightly longer at the ruff. Generally, the body of a TFT should be mostly white. He comes in several color combinations: Tricolor: mostly black head, tan markings on cheeks, lips, and eye dots, body over fifty percent white with or without black markings. White and Tan: mostly tan head, body over fifty percent white with or without tan markings. White and black: mostly black head, body over fifty percent white with black markings. White, chocolate and tan: (allowed in AKC and CKC, not UKC) mostly chocolate head, tan markings on cheeks, lips and eye dots. Body is over fifty percent white with or without chocolate body spots. Brush your TFT"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your TFT to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
They can be active, fun loving companions for older children, but like most toy breeds, they are not recommended playmates for very young children. Their small size, tendency to break bones easily, and terrier tenacity can make a bad combination with very young children. They get along well with other dogs and cats in their home, although they may be territorial toward strange dogs passing or approaching their property.

The Treeing Tennessee Brindle stands out from other trailing dogs for his brindle coat, strong scenting ability, and versatility. He sniffs out all kinds of game and sends it up a tree, holding it there until the hunter arrives. A descendant of the Old Brindle Cur dog, he comes from the piney woods of the Ozark Mountains, the deep hollows of the Appalachian Mountains, and everywhere in between. The breed"s promoter was Rev. Earl Phillips, who gathered information about them in the 1960s. In 1967, the Treeing Tennessee Brindle Breeders Association was formed to preserve the brindle-colored cur dogs with their intelligent, courageous, and companionable temperaments. The TTB"s primary characteristic is his brindle coat. He"s smaller than the Plott, with a shorter ear and a different build. He"s acclaimed for his good voice and sings out when he"s on the trail. Despite the emphasis on the brindle coat in the name, when it comes to this breed, performance is paramount.

Descended from English Foxhounds and formerly classified as an English Coonhound, the Treeing Walker earned his name by trailing game faster than other coonhounds and then treeing it until the hunter arrived. The Walker part of the name comes from Kentuckian John W. Walker, who helped develop the breed. This classic tricolor hound has a racy build, a short, clear bark, and a strong desire to hunt. Personalities range from outgoing to bashful to protective. Like any hound, the Treeing Walker requires patient, consistent training and plenty of daily exercise.

This breed is often described as the "Velcro Vizsla." Most dogs are affectionate, but this medium-size hunting dog is especially attached to his people. His Velcro nature has to do with his past: the Vizsla was developed in Hungary to be both a pointer and retriever who would work close to the hunter, never ranging too far away. That trait is still seen in today"s Vizsla, who prefers to be leaning against your leg or serving as a footwarmer. If having a dog shadow you all day would annoy you, choose a different breed. Despite their penchant for sticking close to their human pals, Vizslas are versatile and hard-working dogs who are happiest when they have a job to do. In a family, that job can be hunting companion, therapy dog, or jogging buddy. Give him at least an hour of exercise per day, and the Vizsla will be your best friend. If you"re interested in dog sports and activities, your Vizsla would probably be happy to compete. The Vizsla is the first and so far only breed to produce a quintuple champion — in conformation, field, obedience and agility. His superb scenting skills make him a natural hunter. Vizslas have also been guide dogs, drug-detection dogs, therapy dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs, and have competed in falconry, flyball, tracking, and hunt tests. Whatever you do with your Vizsla, train this sensitive dog with kindness and positive reinforcement. He"s quick to learn, and his keen senses and protective instinct make him an excellent watchdog. Vizslas are talkers, and will whine, moan, or make other noises to let you know their opinion on everything that"s going on. Some can become recreational barkers if this habit isn"t controlled early on. Not surprisingly, the best home for a Vizsla is one in which someone is there during the day to keep him company and give him the activity and mental stimulation he needs. Without them, he can become bored and destructive. With the right family, however, he"s a lively, loving, gentle friend who will return tenfold the love you give him.
Vizslas are an active breed and need at least 60 minutes of exercise every day. They enjoy long walks, jogging, and playing fetch, as well as dog sports. Vizslas are low to moderate shedders and need only weekly brushings to keep them free of loose hair. They rarely need baths and don"t have a strong doggy odor. Vizslas thrive on human companionship. They"ll follow family members from room to room and like to be touching or touched by their people. Vizslas aren"t recommended for people who work long hours. Vizslas can suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Vizslas tend to be chewers. Keep your Vizsla supplied with plenty of chew toys to protect your possessions. Vizslas do best in homes with fenced yards where they can safely run and play. Vizslas should live in the home with the family, not outside. Their coat doesn"t protect them from cold temperatures and they can"t thrive without human companionship. Although they aren"t recommended for homes with young kids, Vizslas are very affectionate with children and can make great companions for older, energetic kids. Training and socialization is a must with this breed. They can be difficult to handle if they aren"t properly trained and they can become shy and timid if they"re not properly socialized. Vizslas do well with other dogs and will even get along with cats if they"re raised with them. However, they"re not a good fit for homes that have small pets such as rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, or birds. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or from a breeder who doesn"t provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and breeds for sound temperaments. If you"re buying a puppy, meet the puppy"s parents — they"re an indicator of what your pup"s future personality might be like. They should be friendly and sociable, not high-strung or overly shy.
Sometimes known as the Hungarian Pointer, the Vizsla probably descends from hunting dogs used by the Magyars, who settled Hungary more than a thousand years ago. The dogs were no doubt used by nobles and warlords to hunt game birds and hares. Eventually, the dogs were developed to both point and retrieve. Images of the Vizsla"s past can be found in ancient art. A 10th century etching shows a smooth-coated dog accompanying a Magyar huntsman. A chapter on falconry in a 14th century manuscript depicts a Vizsla-shaped dog. By the 19th and early 20th century the Vizsla was a distinct breed with excellent scenting powers who worked closely with his handler. During World War I, the talented hunting dog was used to deliver messages. The aftermath of World War I, followed by the ravages of World War II, nearly brought an end to the breed, however. Fortunately, the Vizsla managed to survive, and the first members of the breed were imported to the United States in the early 1950s. At that time, the breed looked much different than today: they had longer muzzles and a bonier topskull. Some had a houndy appearance, with long ears, and others ranged in color from chocolate brown to almost bleached out. The Vizsla Club of America was formed in 1954 and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1960. Breeders have worked to standardize the distinctive Vizsla appearance and aristocratic bearing that you see today. Today the Vizsla is a beloved companion who can be found performing a multitude of jobs. Some were even working at Ground Zero after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The breed is moderately popular, ranking 43rd among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the American Kennel Club.
This is a lightly built, medium-size dog, with males standing 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder, females 21 to 23 inches. The weight range for the breed is 45 to 65 pounds, with females being smaller.
The Vizsla is described as lively, gentle, and affectionate, with above-average learning ability and a strong desire to be with people. He"s known for being biddable, but there are always exceptions — some Vizslas can be stubborn, excitable, or shy. Energetic and athletic, the Vizsla can become bored and destructive if left to his own devices. But when he has the training, exercise, and companionship he needs, this eager-to-please dog is hard to beat. Like every dog, Vizslas need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
Vizslas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Vizslas will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Vizslas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren"t issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn"t breed her dogs until they"re two or three years old. The following conditions may affect Vizslas: Epilepsy is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be managed with medication but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. Canine Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog"s fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog"s life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life. Lymphosarcoma is the third most common cancer seen in dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer is treated with chemotherapy and approximately 80 percent of dogs treated will go into remission. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.
Exercise, exercise, and exercise, plus work in the form of canine sports or therapy work is the key to a happy and healthy relationship with a Vizsla. Give him at least two half-hour workouts daily in the form of walks, runs, or games of fetch, or he"ll become destructive and hard to handle. When training the Vizsla, be consistent and kind, never harsh. He responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. For best results, begin training as soon as you bring your puppy home. A few minutes of practice several times a day will bring success before you know it. The people-oriented Vizsla should live in your home with you, not out in the yard. He needs a fenced yard where he can play safely. Keep in mind that an underground electronic fence won"t protect him from other dogs that come into the yard. Being a retrieving dog, the Vizsla is mouthy and likes to chew. Provide him with a variety of chew toys and rotate them regularly so he doesn"t get bored and decide to gnaw on the furniture, your shoes, or other expensive items.
Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Vizsla in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Vizsla, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Dressed in various shades of solid golden rust, the Vizsla has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the body. The eyes and nose come in various shades of brown. Some breeders sell Vizslas with a woolly undercoat, coats that are longer than normal, or of a different color (dark mahogany red or pale yellow, or coats with more than a small spot of white on the forechest or toes), or a black nose. These traits aren"t allowed in the breed standard — the written description of what the breed should look like — and they"re a good sign that you should look for another breeder. Responsible breeders try to stick closely to the breed standard. The Vizsla is easy to groom. He doesn"t have a strong doggy odor and requires only weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush and a wipe down with a damp cloth. Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Vizsla enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Start brushing and examining your Vizsla when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.
The Vizsla is a loving dog who"s friendly and tolerant with children, but his exuberance can be overwhelming for kids younger than six years old. As with any dog, teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and kids to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Vizslas get along with other dogs and can be friends with cats, especially if they"re raised with them. They might be a little too fond of pet birds, if you know what we mean. Nor should they be trusted around small pets such as rabbits, hamsters, or gerbils.

Your first exposure to the Weimaraner may have been through the photographs, calendars, and books of William Wegman, a photographer who uses wigs, costumes, and props to capitalize on the breed"s ability to assume almost human expressions. His ever-patient Weimaraners have impersonated Louis XIV, posed in bed watching television, and appeared as Little Red Riding Hood.But the Weimaraner"s earliest job was to serve as an all-around hunting dog who handled big game such as deer, bear, and wolves. As Germany"s forests shrank and big game became scarce, the Weimaraner"s handlers turned the breed"s talents to hunt birds, rabbits and foxes.He takes his name from the place in Germany where he was developed — the Court of Weimar, whose noblemen wanted a dog with courage married to intelligence, one with good scenting ability and speed and stamina on the trail.How they achieved their dream dog, first known as the Weimar Pointer, is unknown, but it"s believed that the breeds bred to create the Weimaraner include the Bloodhound, the English Pointer, the German Shorthaired Pointer, the blue Great Dane, and the silver-gray Huehnerhund, or chicken dog.Today, Weimaraners are affectionately called Weims, Silver Ghosts, or Gray Ghosts. Part of their appeal lies in their sleek mouse-gray to silver-gray coat and light amber, blue-gray, or gray eyes. But there"s far more to the Weimaraner than his distinctive appearance. The elegant, aristocratic dogs are loving and devoted.A Weimaraner"s first desire is to be with his people, preferably within touching range. It"s not for nothing that many Weimaraners bear the name Shadow. They"ll lie at your feet or follow you through the house.Weimaraners aren"t the breed for everyone, however. First-time dog owners need not apply. These dogs have a great deal of energy and stamina and need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation. Without it, they"re likely to become nervous and high-strung. They can be quite a handful, with loads of energy to burn, and the intelligence to figure out how to get into trouble all on their own!Because they"re hunting dogs, Weimaraners have a strong prey drive. If not trained or kept under control, they"ll chase and kill anything that resembles prey, including cats and small dogs, mice, frogs, birds, and more. They will then proudly present you with their trophies. They"ll also chase joggers and bicyclists.Despite their hunting instincts, Weimaraners are house dogs (like most dogs). They"re temperamentally unsuited to living in a kennel or being kept in the backyard with little human interaction.Weims are independent thinkers and will constantly test your boundaries. If you haven"t owned a Weimaraner before, you"ll do well to attend puppy kindergarten followed by obedience class. Training should be gentle and firm, however, because harsh treatment will make him resentful.Once he"s trained, the Weimaraner is a versatile dog who can be an up-close-and-personal hunting companion, compete in agility, and be a fine family friend.
Weimaraners were bred to have a lot of energy and stamina. Be prepared to provide them with lots of exercise and mental stimulation. Weims aren"t a soft-mouthed dog like a Golden Retriever and some have a low tolerance for small, furry animals, such as rabbits, and even cats and dogs. Until you know your dog well, watch him carefully when small animals are in his presence. Weims are high-strung dogs and can suffer from severe separation anxiety. If left alone for too long, they may bark, become destructive, or even injure themselves. Although Weimaraners are hunting dogs, they don"t like living outdoors. They require a lot of attention and want to be close to you. Weims often are suspicious of strangers and can be unacceptably aggressive. Socializing them to many different people and situations when they are puppies and throughout their lives is critical. Weimaraners are intelligent and they think for themselves. Firm, consistent, gentle training must continue throughout their lives. Weimaraners can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended. Unethical breeders may advertise blue or black Weims as "rare" to attract buyers and will charge more for pups of these colors, but the truth is that blue and black Weimaraners are disqualified in the breed standard. Weims are intelligent and can learn quickly, but if their intelligence and energy aren"t channeled constructively, they may learn some things you don"t want them to know, such as how to open doors and escape. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Weimaraner dates to the early 19th century, when he was developed at the Weimar court in what is now Germany. The noblemen there loved hunting and they wanted a dog with courage, intelligence, good scenting ability, speed, and stamina. This dog would stick close to them as they walked in search of game and would be a close companion in the evening by the fireside.How they achieved their dream dog, first known as the Weimar Pointer, is unknown, but it"s believed that the breeds used to create the Weimaraner included the Bloodhound, the English Pointer, the German Shorthaired Pointer, the blue Great Dane, and the silver-gray Huehnerhund, or chicken dog. As the decades passed, Germany"s forests shrank and big game became scarce. The Weimaraner"s handlers turned the breed"s talents to hunt birds, rabbits and foxes.In 1897, an exclusive club was stared in Germany to maintain the breed and ensure that responsible breeders would oversee its development. No one was allowed to buy a Weimaraner unless they joined the club. Strict guidelines were imposed upon the breeding of Weimaraners.In 1929, Howard Knight, an American sportsman, was allowed to join the German club and bring two Weimaraner dogs to the U.S. The Germans were so protective of their "Gray Ghosts" that although Knight promised he would protect the purity of the breed, the club sent him two desexed dogs.Knight was not deterred, however. He kept working to get some foundation dogs that he could breed in the U.S. Finally, in 1938, he acquired three females and a male puppy. The females included two littermates, Adda and Dorle v. Schwarzen Kamp, and a year-old female named Aura v. Gailberg. The male puppy was named Mars aus der Wulfsreide.Other breeders joined Knight in his quest to breed Weimaraners in the U.S. and in 1942, the Weimaraner Club of American was formed. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed at the end of 1942. The breed made its formal show debut at the Westminster Kennel Club show in 1943.During World War II, it became difficult for German breeders to keep their dogs, so many outstanding Weimaraners were sent to the U.S.At the end of World War II, many American servicemen brought Weimaraners home with them, and they quickly grew in popularity, especially when President Dwight D. Eisenhower brought his Weimaraner, Heidi, to the White House. By the mid- to late 1950s, Weimaraners were the 12th most popular breed registered by the AKC. Unfortunately, as often happens, this led to a lot of irresponsible breeding. As the quality of the breed dropped and temperament problems became common, the Weimaraner"s popularity fell.By the late 1960s, the number of Weim registrations fell to nearly half of what they had been in 1957. Registrations kept decreasing throughout the 1970s and 1980s. This allowed breeders who were dedicated to the breed (not just breeding puppies to sell) an opportunity to improve the health, temperament and conformation of the Weimaraner breed. Registrations began to climb in the 1990s, and today the Weimaraner is once again of the most popular breeds in America. He ranks 30th among the 155 breeds and varieties registered by the AKC.
Male Weimaraners stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 70 to 85 pounds. Females are between 23 and 25 inches tall and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.
Early tales about the Weimaraner made it seem as if the dog came fully trained and was perfect in all respects. Even today, many people still hold this belief about the breed. Unfortunately for them, there"s no such thing as a dog that comes programmed with good behavior.The typical Weimaraner is friendly, fearless, alert, and obedient, all traits that make him an excellent companion and watchdog. On the flip side, he"s assertive, smart, restless, and willful. This is a dog who will take over the household if you give him half a chance. He"ll chew, bark, chase cats, and steal the roast off the counter — if you don"t give him the socialization, training, and structure he needs throughout his life.Aggression and shyness are temperament flaws that are seen in this breed. They must be dealt with early and may require the assistance of a behaviorist or experienced trainer to avoid serious behavior problems such as biting.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Weimaraners need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. For the Weim, however, socialization should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Weimaraner puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Weimaraners are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Weims will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Weims, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: This is an abnormality of the hip joint. It may affect one or both sides. Dogs with hip dysplasia may or may not show any clinical signs. Although the tendency toward hip dysplasia is thought to be inherited, diet, rapid growth, and environment also are thought to be contributors to the condition. Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It"s important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. von Willebrand"s Disease (vWD): This is an inherited blood disorder that is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand"s disease lead normal lives. If you feel this is a concern, your vet can perform tests to determine if your dog has it. Distichiasis: This is a condition in which the dog has an extra row of eyelashes, usually on the lower lid, that cause irritation to the cornea and tearing. Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Weimaraner has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if necessary. Factor XI Deficiency: This is another bleeding disorder that usually is minor, but may become severe after trauma or surgery. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog"s fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog"s life. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don"t make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Immune-mediated Disease: A small percentage of Weimaraner puppies react to vaccinations, particularly combination vaccines, with fever, elevated white blood count, and inflamed tissues and joints. Reactions occur most often at 12 to 16 weeks of age. The Weimaraner Club of America recommends that puppies be vaccinated only at 8 and 12 weeks of age with four core vaccines: distemper, adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, and parvovirus. The rabies vaccination can be given at 16 weeks of age.
The first thing to know about the Weimaraner is that he"s a housedog. He"s not meant for kennel or backyard life, and he"s also not suited to apartment living. This highly active dog needs a large, securely fenced yard where he can run, and an active family who can provide him with the exercise and mental stimulation he needs.A sense of humor helps as well, especially when you see how your Weim has relandscaped your yard in his efforts to rid it of mice, moles, and bugs. He"ll be proud of himself for his good efforts, so don"t forget to praise him as you calculate in your head how much time, money, and effort it will require to put the yard back the way you like it. You might want to supervise him more closely and provide him with additional exercise.Weimaraners need a couple of hours of exercise daily if you want to prevent recreational barking, chewing and digging. Play fetch and other running games, take him jogging or hiking, teach him to run alongside your bicycle, or get him involved in a dog sport such as agility or flyball. And, of course, you can always take him hunting.Be sure your yard is escape-proof. Weims are Houdinis when it comes to confinement, and they"re very good at learning how to open doors and gates and jump over or dig under fences. That"s another reason why it"s best to have them as housedogs.In the house, a mature, well-trained Weimaraner will be your shadow, from bedroom to bathroom to kitchen to den. A Weimaraner puppy is a challenge and requires careful supervision. He can be a destructive chewer and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is a good idea.Weimaraners of any age with separation anxiety, which is not unusual in this breed, can become destructive and may "dig" in your carpet or sofa in an attempt to create a secure nest.It"s certainly not a behavior problem, but be aware that Weimaraners have loose lips. Nope, they won"t sink ships, but they will splash water everywhere when they drink. Keep hand towels handy to wipe their mouths and clean up spills.Weimaraners are highly intelligent, but they"re also independent thinkers. That combination can make them a challenge when it comes to training. Be consistent and firm, but gentle. The Weimaraner is sensitive and doesn"t respond well to anger, but you must be able to say "No" and mean it. Keep training sessions short and interesting, and always end them when he"s done something right so you can praise him for a job well done. Last but not least, hold tight to your sense of humor. Your Weimaraner may or may not do as you ask, depending on any number of factors, but he"ll always disobey with style.Among the talents your Weimaraner may acquire are getting ice from the dispenser in the door of your refrigerator, turning on faucets, and opening gates and doors — including refrigerator doors. It"s a cinch to teach him tricks and you may want to do so, simply to keep him occupied and out of trouble.
Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Keep your Weimaraner svelte by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Weim, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Weimaraner"s coat is short, smooth, sleek, and solid-colored, ranging from mouse-gray to silver-gray, usually with lighter shades on the head and ears. A distinctly long coat is a disqualification according to the American Kennel Club breed standard — a written description of how a breed looks — but in European countries a longhaired variety is recognized. Longhaired Weimaraners have a silky coat and feathering on their tails and legs, but they are rarely seen in this country.A Weim"s nose is dark gray. Inside the flaps of the ears and on the lips, where the coat is thin or nonexistent, the skin is pink, not white or black.A Weimaraner is one of the easiest breeds to groom. Even when he has been running through mud, the dirt just seems to fall off him. Weekly brushing with a bristle brush should keep his coat and skin healthy. Weimaraners shed, but brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. To make his silvery coat shine, wipe him down with a chamois. Bathe when needed. He takes great pleasure in rolling in anything stinky, so this may be more often than would normally be necessary.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Weimaraner"s ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Weimaraner may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Weimaraner"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Weimaraner enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Weimaraner to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
For an active older child who"s familiar with dogs, a Weimaraner can be a great companion. They"re far too rambunctious for toddlers, however, and may chase small children who are running.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Weimaraners are not the best choice for families with cats, small dogs, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, or birds. Weimaraners have a strong prey drive and it"s difficult, if not impossible, to redirect that instinct. They will go after and kill, if possible, any small or large furry animals they see.

The Welsh Springer Spaniel (Welsh Springer or Welshie for short) takes his name from the way he "springs" at game to flush it for the hunter. He has been a favorite with sportsmen for more than 200 years. These lively, beautiful dogs excel in the field, and also are wonderful companions and family pets. A medium-size dog with a compact body, the Welshie"s outstanding physical characteristic is a silky dark red and white coat of medium length that"s dense with feathering on the ears, chest, legs and belly. He has large, hanging ears and a gentle expression. Welsh Springers are a little smaller and lighter than English Springers, and a bit taller and larger than English Cocker Spaniels. Welsh Springer Spaniels are trainable and eager to please. As a typical spaniel, they have a lot of enthusiasm. They are a little less outgoing than English Springer Spaniels and somewhat independent. They"re gentle around children if they grow up with them or are exposed to them when they"re young, and they"re affectionate toward their families. Welshies can be reserved around strangers, and early socialization is important to prevent timidity. They are generally good with other pets in the household, even small ones, although they might see birds as prey since that"s what they are bred to hunt. Because they"re bred to be hunting dogs, Welshies require a lot more exercise than your average dog. They have a great deal of stamina and energy and can work for hours in all kinds of weather and terrain. That hunting instinct is strong, so keep them on leash in unfenced unless you want to see them take off in pursuit of a bird or bunny. Their enthusiasm for hunting is so great that they have a tendency to wander from the hunt field. Training a Welshie from a young age to come when called is a must. The Welshie"s athletic skills aren"t limited to hunting. Many people who have one participate in such activities as obedience, agility, flyball, and tracking. Because Welshies have such happy natures, they make great companions and family dogs. Their only aim in life — besides going after birds — is to be near their people and to please them in any way possible.
Welsh Springer Spaniels are not as outgoing as English Springer Spaniels and may be a bit standoffish with strangers unless they are well socialized. They can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too much and for too long. If this occurs, they may engage in destructive behavior. Welsh Springer Spaniels have a "soft" personality and will not respond well to harsh training methods. Although they are very trainable and eager to please, housetraining can be a challenge. Crate training is recommended. Especially when they are young, Welsh Springer Spaniels can greet you with a great deal of exuberance, jumping up on you and generally showing their joy at seeing you. You might want to train them not to jump, especially if you have children that they might accidentally knock to the ground. Welsh Springer Spaniels were developed to have great stamina and energy. Be sure you can provide your dog with adequate exercise or he may become nervous and destructive. Some Welsh Springer Spaniels can demonstrate submissive urination. Be sure to keep your Welsh Springer Spaniel on a leash when you take him to unfenced areas. You never know when he will see a bird or other small animal and be overcome by his instinct to hunt! To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Spaniels are thought to have originated in Spain (hence their name) many centuries ago and eventually spread to other parts of the world. Welsh Springers, English Cockers, English Springer Spaniels, and other spaniels of British origin all share a similar early history. At first, all spaniels were called Cockers or Cocking Spaniels. They were named for the function they performed, not their type. Early breeders often interbred different types of dogs. Later, they began to divide spaniels into Water Spaniels and Land Spaniels. Welsh Springer Spaniel types were considered Land Spaniels. Many early writings mention a Welsh Cocker that many believe was the forerunner of today"s Welsh Springer Spaniel. Tapestries created during the Renaissance depict a Land Spaniel that looks very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel. Welsh Springer Spaniels became a favorite hunting dog of nobility during the 1700s, but in the 1800s, they were replaced by English Springers and other spaniels. Eventually, the breed was revitalized during the Victorian period in England. At early dog shows in the 1800s, Welsh Springer Spaniels competed in the same class as English Springers, with the only difference being color. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was recognized by Britain"s Kennel Club as a separate variety from the English Springer Spaniel in 1902. Originally, the breed was called the Welsh Spaniel or the Welsh Cocker. When designating it as a separate breed, the Kennel Gazette called it a Welsh Springer, which some feel might have caused some confusion with the English Springer Spaniel. Purists of the breed stress that Welsh Springers have no more connection with today"s English Springer than any other variety of spaniel and are, indeed, their own separate breed. Several South Wales gentry raised Welsh Springers for years. One notable breeder in the early 1900s was A.T. Williams, of Ynys-y-Gerwn, Neath. He was passionate about the working abilities of the breed and lobbied for the preservation of its character and type. His grandfather had also had Welsh Springers in the late 1800s. Williams" had a dog named Corrin, which was born in 1893. Corrin was the first Welsh Springer Spaniel to be photographed, and was a key stud dog of the breed, as well as a successful show and working dog. Welsh Springer Spaniels were imported to America in the late 1800s and quickly gained popularity. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized the breed in 1906. In the first 20 years of the 1900s, although they never were to become a very common breed, popularity of Welsh Springer Spaniels grew both in the U.S. and England. One of the leading exhibitors and breeders in England was Mrs. H.D. Greene of Craven Arms, Shropshire. Her Longmynd bitches were immortalized in a painting by Maud Earl, an artist who was known primarily for her paintings of dogs and other animals. Mrs. Green was the Secretary of the first Welsh Spaniel Club in England, and unfortunately lost her kennel during World War I. In the U.S., August A Busch of Anheuser-Busch beer brewing fame, imported some dogs from R Hughes of Swansea, as well as two females named Longmynd Twig and L May Queen. World War I and World War II took its toll on dog breeding in the U.S. as elsewhere in the world. Between the years 1926 and 1948, no Welsh Springer Spaniels were registered by the AKC, and it was believed that there were no longer any in the U.S. After World War II, dogs were imported from England to revive the breed, and in 1961, the Welsh Springer parent club was formed. In England, the breed fared only a little better. After World War I, a new breed club was formed for Welsh Springers by Lt. Col. John Downes-Powell. The club was formed in 1923, and Lt. Col. Downes-Powell served as its Honorable Secretary until 1947. During the time between World War I and World War II, some outstanding Welsh Springers were produced in England, including Ch. Shot O"r Baili, and Ch. Marksman O"Mathern. One of the most influential dams was Goitre Lass, owned by Mr D Lewis of Talybont-on Usk. She had 9 litters between 1926 and 1932. Six of those litters were the result of being bred to Ch. Merglam Bang and produced five full Champions, three other CC winners and several other award winners. In 1939, an English dog exhibitor named Harold Newman was entrusted with ensuring the breed"s survival during World War II. His dogs and his personality as a breeder, exhibitor, and judge are cited as major factors that helped Welsh Springer Spaniels stage a comeback in England in 1945. His stud named Dewi Sant sired eight show and full Champions. Newman gave a start to Miss D.H. Ellis (Downland) among others. Miss Ellis re-established the breed in the U.S. in 1950, and began Anne West"s Linkhill kennel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club of America was founded in 1961 with 21 members. Today, their membership is more than 400 with members from the U.S., Canada, U.K, Finland, and Holland. Several of the founding members are still with the club. The Club held its first AKC Sanctioned Match for Welsh Springers in 1964 at the Randhaven Kennels. Always dedicated to preserving the working characteristics of the Welsh Springer Spaniel, the parent club holds many activities including sanctioned matches, hunt tests, obedience trials, and agility and tracking events.
The average height at the shoulder for male Welsh Springer Spaniels is 18 to 19 inches, and they typically weigh 40 to 55 pounds. Females are usually 17 to 18 inches tall and weigh 35 to 50 pounds.
Welsh Springer Spaniels are trainable and eager to please. As a typical spaniel, they have a lot of enthusiasm and can sometimes be impulsive or headstrong. They are a little less outgoing than English Springer Spaniels and somewhat independent. Welshies can be reserved around strangers, and early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — is important to prevent timidity. They"ll bark to let you know when people are approaching — happily for friends and more loudly or sharply for strangers. When they"re not outdoors, expect them to spend a lot of time looking out the window to keep an eye on everything that"s going on.
Welsh Springers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Welshies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Welshies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Entropion: This is a condition caused by the lower eyelid folding inward toward the eye, resulting in a chronic irritation of the surface of the eye. It can be corrected through surgery. Epilepsy: This seizure disorder has been noted in some lines of Welsh Springer Spaniels and can be treated with medication. There is no cure.
Welsh Springer Spaniels can be kept outside, with adequate shelter from the heat and cold, but they are such wonderful family companions, why wouldn"t you want them in your house, sleeping at your feet in the evening? Welsh Springer Spaniels are fairly active indoors and can live comfortably in city apartments (with proper exercise, of course) or in the country. They do best with at least an average-size yard in which to run. Wherever they live, they are energetic dogs that need a lot of exercise to keep them from becoming fat, bored, and lazy. Keep training sessions short and positive. That"s more suited to their personality and attention span than boring repetition. Train them with understanding and patience, and you"ll be well rewarded.
Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. You can determine whether your Welshie is overweight by using the hands-on test. Place your hands on him, thumbs along the spine and fingers going down the sides. You should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle. If you can see the ribs, he"s too thin. If they"re undetectable beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. For more on feeding your Welshie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Welsh Springer Spaniels have a naturally straight, flat, soft coat that is never wiry or wavy. It"s dense enough to serve as protection from wet, cold weather and rough country. They have some moderate feathering on the backs of the forelegs, the hind legs above the hocks, the chest, and the belly. The ears and tail are also lightly feathered. The coat is a dark, rich red and white. The white area may be flecked with red ticking. Welsh Springer Spaniels are fairly easy to groom. Brush them regularly to keep them looking their best and to prevent mats, which are especially common when they"re shedding. Because their ears hang down, you need to check your Welshie"s ears and clean them at least once a week to prevent ear infections. Bathe them only when necessary.
Welsh Springers are gentle around children if they grow up with them or are exposed to them when they"re young. If they"re raised with them from puppyhood, they are generally good with other pets in the household, even small ones, although they might see birds as prey since that"s what they are bred to hunt.

He may look like a small Airedale, but the Welsh Terrier has his own personality. It"s certainly a strong personality, and no wonder — he was bred to hunt badgers, foxes, and otters. Although not many folks hunt badgers these days, hunting cookies in the yard is a solid alternative. Smart as can be, this party boy excels in agility, flyball, tracking, earthdog, and obedience competitions. He"s also been involved in both search and rescue work and therapy. The Welshie is a lot of dog in a medium-sized package, and first-time owners would do better with a less independent breed. However, other dog lovers may wish to step up to the challenge of life with a freethinker whose prime desire has nothing to do with pleasing you. He"s a problem solver, which can be wonderful and terrifying. Don"t underestimate his problem-solving skills, because if he"s bored, that"s a problem to be solved. He"s not for the faint of heart, or for those looking for a quiet companion or for instant obedience. As a matter of fact, obedience might be a long time in coming — but it will eventually, with repeated effort. He needs intellectual stimulation, and if you can provide that in his training, there"ll be no stopping him in competition. First and foremost, this boy has to burn off steam every day or you"ll be scraping him off the ceiling. He has a ton of energy and requires — not just needs — an hour of exercise every day. If you"re looking for a jogging companion, he"s your man; and he"ll be up early brewing your coffee while waiting for you to get your running shoes on. Regardless of how much exercise he gets, you should still expect to see some rough play in the house that can result in Welsh Terriers flying off couches or knocking over lamps. They"re surprisingly tough when it comes to this kind of play (whereas some gentler canine souls dislike the wild play of children). The kids will have a great time with him as they roughhouse — and nap — together; Welshies are terrific with kids. A word of caution: If you play with your Welsh Terrier inside the house, don"t expect him to not race through the house at other times. It becomes an accepted behavior, and he"ll launch himself off furniture whenever the mood hits. And that might be often, since he enjoys being in high altitudes and will frequently relax on picnic benches and tables. A Welshie is intelligent, and while that helps him grasp concepts easily, he can be difficult to train. You won"t get anywhere with boring, rote lessons — in fact, repetition is the best way to get a Welsh Terrier to ignore you. On the other hand, you"ll be amazed at what you can accomplish with fun, positive training that convinces him that you"re the one in charge. He was bred to be freethinking, like a child of the sixties, so if you work with this trait instead of against it, you"ll have more fun than you can imagine. He can do well in homes with other dogs, but he needs to be properly socialized to keep him from being dog-aggressive. He"s definitely not recommended for homes with small animals due to his strong prey drive. Although it"s not ideal, the Welsh Terrier can live in an apartment. He"s a born watchdog and will bark when he sees or hears something suspicious — which can be a problem in buildings with noise restrictions. A house with a small fenced yard is better suited to his energy and noise, particularly if you don"t mind a few holes in the lawn here and there. Like many other terriers, the Welshie has a great time digging and can easily make a mess of gardens and yards. Despite his hardiness, he does better living indoors with the people he loves rather than outside in a kennel. The Welsh Terrier can be a perfect, devoted companion for an active family who has the time to care for him and meet his exercise requirements. He"s independent enough to not yearn for or demand excessive attention, yet he"s affectionate enough to enjoy time spent cuddling on the couch. He"ll fill the house with the sounds of life and just might grace your furniture and tables. The Welsh Terrier is proof that life can be lived to the fullest and that not all good things come in big packages.
A Welsh Terrier can do all right in apartments if properly exercised, but the ideal is a house with a fenced yard. As a low- to nonshedder, the Welshie can make a great companion for people with allergies. Expect a fair amount of grooming. Welshies need their coats brushed on a regular basis and also need their coats stripped about every eight weeks. Welsh Terriers can be difficult to train and require a consistent and fun training program. For this reason they aren"t recommended for first-time owners. The Welsh Terrier is an independent breed not prone to separation anxiety. He will require toys and activities to keep him entertained, since a bored Welsh Terrier can become destructive. Welshies love kids. They like to be up in high places and will climb onto tables and other high furniture. Like many terriers, the Welshie has a strong prey drive. Welsh Terriers can be combative with other dogs and need to be properly socialized from an early age. Barking and digging are common traits. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Although the history of the Welsh Terrier is not completely clear, we can ascertain from paintings and prints that the breed is quite old and may have been one of the first Terriers. He was originally known as the Black-and-Tan Wire Haired Terrier or the Old English Terrier. Although associated with Wales, he lived in many parts of England during the 19th century. He was commonly used to hunt foxes, otters, and badgers, and he excelled at eradicating vermin. He was commonly shown and categorized as an Old English Terrier, a category under which many Terrier breeds were classified. It wasn"t until 1885 that he was classified as a Welsh Terrier by the Kennel Club of England. Welsh Terriers began arriving in the United States in 1888, though their importation was erratic. By 1901, however, the Welsh Terrier finally established a footing in the United States, and his popularity grew at a steady pace.
The Welsh Terrier is a medium-sized dog. The average height is 15 to 15.5 inches, females being slightly smaller than males. The average weight is usually 20 pounds, but weight should be in proportion to the height and bone density of each individual dog.
The Welsh Terrier is a cheerful, intelligent dog who loves to have fun and is always affectionate. He"s energetic and has a playful nature. Loyal and devoted to his family, he can nevertheless be quite the social butterfly. He loves to amuse both himself and his family, and he"s not as hot-tempered as some other terrier breeds. His loving disposition and energy makes him an excellent family companion who"s great with children. The Welshie can be independent, which may lead to some training difficulties (especially with inexperienced owners). But this is usually offset by what most people love best about the Welsh Terrier: his happy, fun-loving zest for life. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Welshie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Welshie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Welshies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Welshies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Welshies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Welsh Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog"s diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Glaucoma: This is a painful disease in which pressure in the eye is abnormally high due to improper drainage of normal eye fluids. This causes damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma may be hereditary, or it may be the result of some other problem in the eye, such as inflammation, a tumor, or injury. The affected eye will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful; the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even when treated with surgery or medication. Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.
Training a Welsh Terrier can be a study in who is more determined, the trainer who"s trying to get the Terrier to listen, or the bored Terrier who"s ignoring the trainer. The Welshie is known for having a mind of his own and he"s not the most obedient of breeds — he"s no sunny Golden Retriever — so he will often test limits. Train him with positive reinforcement and consistency. Harsh corrections can shut down any chance at getting through to him. The Welsh Terrier can also become bored easily, so he requires an interesting training routine. Breaking training up with fun games, keeping it free of repetition, and giving him something to work for are excellent ways to get him more interested in training. Socialization is important with a Welsh Terrier. He can be combative with other dogs and animals, but this trait can be corrected with proper training and early and ongoing socialization. In fact, Welsh Terriers generally do well with other dogs once they"re socialized. A Welsh Terrier is a high-energy dog. Even with a vigorous exercise routine, you should expect some of that energy to be converted into room-crashing escapades that range throughout the house. He should have a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, which can be accomplished by playing in a yard or dog park (as long as he isn"t too dog-aggressive to go to the dog park), playing in the house, or going on a long walk. Letting him hang in the yard by himself is not going to be enough — and he"ll probably jump the fence. The Welsh Terrier is very fond of toys and will burn off ample energy playing by himself with his favorite squeaky toy. He can also make an excellent jogging companion, though his high prey drive means you should keep him leashed on walks. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Welshie doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Welshie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Welshie in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Welshies are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel. Although it"s not ideal, the Welsh Terrier can live in an apartment. He will bark, though, and this can become a problem in buildings with noise restrictions. A house with a small, fenced yard is better. Also, he needs to live indoors with the people he loves.
Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Welshie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Welshie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Sporting two coats to waterproof himself, the Welsh Terrier has an outer coat that"s hard and wiry and an undercoat that"s soft and short. He only has one color pattern: tan and black. A non- to light shedder, the Welshie still requires a fair amount of grooming. He should be brushed at least once per week, although it"s frankly better to do it every other day. Unless he"s clipped, that wiry coat will need to be stripped several times a year to remove any loose or dead hair and to prevent it from matting. Brush your Welshie"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Welshie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Welsh Terrier is a loving dog who can be patient when he needs to be. Add to that a hardiness that allows him to enjoy a fair amount of roughhousing, and you"ll find that he makes a wonderful companion for children. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. He"s also basically compatible with other dogs and can do well in homes where he isn"t the only canine companion. He is a Terrier though, and he may be dog-aggressive if not properly socialized or trained. He"s not recommended for homes with small pets that might be viewed as prey, because all Terriers have a strong prey drive and will give chase.

To say that the West Highland White Terrier — or Westie, as he"s affectionately called — is a "big dog in a little dog"s body" doesn"t do him justice. He"s not pushy or temperamental, and he doesn"t need to challenge or demand. He"s not stubborn so much as just interested in what"s in it for him. Convince him that what you want is in his best interests, and he"ll jump right on board with your plan.Originally developed for hunting and ratting, the Westie learned to think on his own, a trait he still enjoys indulging in today (although there will undoubtedly be times you might not enjoy it quite as much). The Westie"s instinct to work is now usually channelled into agility and obedience competitions rather than getting rid of rodents. He also works as a therapy dog, and a few Westies have even joined search-and-rescue teams. He is also known to compete in earthdog tests, tracking, and flyball. You can focus all of his abundant energy into any one or more of these jobs.Mostly, though, the West Highland White Terrier is a companion, and he enriches his family"s life with his silly antics and love of life. He"s a social guy who gets along well with everyone, strangers included, and he is not a one-person dog. He"s affectionate with children of all ages, and he does well living with older kids. He gets along with other dogs in public settings (unless he"s one of two intact males in the group), and he positively thrives in homes with multiple dogs. He can adapt to cats — despite chasing them from time to time, he will usually settle down nicely with friendly kitties. What he cannot adapt to are small animals that run free, such as rabbits or gerbils, since the wee white one has a strong prey drive.The Westie is happy in any type of living situation and will do well in the country or in the city. He needs to live inside with his family, however, not outside. He makes an excellent apartment resident if properly exercised and trained not to bark. He"s happy to stay at home while you"re at work, and — with proper stimulation and safety precautions — he"s fine on his own during your workday. To top it all off, he"s also an easy traveler, whether on long vacations or short errands.The West Highland White Terrier can be trained easily. He"s intelligent and a quick learner, and training will amuse him as long as it remains positive and consistent. In fact, using positive reinforcement laced with consistency is the only way to train a Westie. Clicker training is an excellent training method for him. You"re wasting your time using harsh corrections, since his "what"s in it for me" attitude is likely to kick in, causing him to shut down and ignore the commands.The Westie will definitely alert bark when he sees or hears something suspicious, and without fail he"ll announce visitors, letter carriers, and dogs who walk in front of the house. Some will even announce bugs who fly by. In other words, he can be pretty darn noisy. But with appropriate training from a young age, he can be taught to bark only once when he sees or hear something.A popular breed, the Westie can be affectionate and loyal but still possess enough independence and self-assurance that he doesn"t need pampering (although he"ll never turn it down). Some Westies like being a lapdog more than others. He likes being clean, which makes him a piece of cake to housetrain. He makes a wonderful companion for a first-time or inexperienced dog owner. With his easygoing nature, intelligent eyes, and fun-loving personality, the Westie can melt even the coldest of hearts.Generally a calm guy when he"s indoors (where he may hang out on the couch like a white lounge lizard), the Westie will often morph into a different dog outside. He can be a speed demon who zooms around the dog park, and he can hike with his people all day. He loves playing games, flinging plush squeaky toys around, or just romping through the backyard sniffing and surveying his domain. And while he can enjoy digging, it seems to be an acquired passion. (With proper training, and by redirecting him whenever you catch him in the act, this habit can be stopped.) Some Westies can be exercised indoors by playing fetch down a hallway. Although he doesn"t require quite as much exercise as some breeds, expect to walk him once or twice every day to keep him happy and healthy.The Westie is not meant to live outside, however. He does best in the house, although he"s not really a lapdog or an avid cuddler. On the independent side, he"ll bypass the center of the action for a spot just near it. (If that spot is close to a heating vent, so much the better.) He can watch the household while you"re at work; although some individuals can suffer from separation anxiety, it"s not a common trait in the breed. Just give him safe but entertaining toys and activities to keep him from becoming bored: turn on a radio, leave him with frozen kongs stuffed with peanut butter, and make his crate a cozy haven.
A Westie can have terrier traits (no surprise there). He will dig, bark, and go after vermin. But with proper training, he can be trained to only bark once and to not dig at all, although some dogs are less easily discouraged than others. The vermin chasing, however, is hardwired, and no amount of training will alter it. A Westie does well in multidog homes, unless there is more than one intact male (and he"s one of them). He can get used to cats. He cannot adapt to small pets, such as rabbits and birds, because of his strong prey drive. He"s generally easy to train if it"s done in a positive and consistent way. Bear in mind that a Westie has a strong will and great self-esteem, which can cause some training difficulties if training becomes boring or is too harsh. His coat is easy to groom and only requires regular brushing. If he"s not clipped, his coat requires stripping about twice a year. He"s a low shedder. Although he doesn"t require as much exercise as other breeds, the Westie still needs one or two daily walks or play sessions. He generally has a low energy level inside the house, though individual dogs vary in this regard. A Westie is adaptable and will do well in any type of dwelling, including apartments (although if he isn"t trained out of barking, he"s likely to cause difficulties with the neighbors). He"s a social dog who gets along well with everyone. He likes children of every age, but he"s better suited to homes with older children. A Westie can be left for long periods of time when his people are working. Turning on a radio, providing toys and kongs, and crating him are the key strategies to use. If you are a fastidious gardener, the Westie is not your best choice, since he may become fond of digging up plants and be just a tad too enthusiastic about helping you garden. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The West Highland White Terrier shares a history with that of the Dandie Dinmont, Skye, Scottish, and Cairn Terriers; they are all considered branches of the same breed. The West Highland White Terrier originated in Scotland and was used for hunting fox, badger, and otter and for killing vermin such as rats.There"s not much evidence to determine the exact history of the West Highland White Terrier, but many believe that the breed can be traced back to the seventeenth century and a small breed of earth dogs that James I of Argyllshire gave to the king of France.According to breed lore, the Westie"s white color resulted from a tragic nineteenth-century accident that occurred while Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch was hunting fox. The colonel accidentally shot and killed one of his wheaten-colored Cairns. Devastated, and determined to prevent such accidents in the future, he decided to breed only white dogs that couldn"t be confused with foxes.The West Highland White Terrier has been known by many names, including the Poltalloch Terrier and the Roseneath Terrier, but he was officially recognized by the Kennel Club of England as the West Highland White Terrier in 1906.
The West Highland White Terrier is a sturdy little dog with a deep chest and a slightly rectangular shape. Males are about 11 inches tall and typically weigh 15 to 22 pounds; females are roughly 10 inches tall and weigh 13 to 16 pounds. (Unless, of course, you have a soft heart and fall prey to those pleading brown eyes — in which case your Westie, of either sex, could weigh at least twice the norm.)
The West Highland White Terrier is a bold, confident, fun-loving, intelligent dog who can find joy in the simplest pleasures of life, such as squeaky toys, a belly rub, and food. His happy disposition and love of life make him a favorite for many, in spite of his mischievousness. He doesn"t lack any self-esteem, but he"s not so overbearing in his confidence that his self-assurance becomes a negative trait.He is friendly and gets along with everyone, and he enjoys being part of his family. No docile lapdog, he can be spunky. He rarely starts a fight, but he is after all a terrier, so he won"t walk away from one. He"s a lively little guy who greets the adventures in life with a sparkle in his eye and a skip in his step — particularly when he"s mowing over your feet to get to his food bowl.Same-sex aggression around other dogs is not rare, though females tend to be more alpha than males. The males lean more toward the happy-go-lucky lapdog.
Westies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Westies will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Westies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Craniomandibular Osteopathy: This condition affects the skull bones while a puppy is growing, causing them to become irregularly enlarged. Symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. Often the puppy"s jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won"t be able to open his mouth. He"ll drool, have a fluctuating fever that recurs every couple of weeks, and, in some cases, his chewing muscles may atrophy. There is no treatment, but anti-inflammatories and pain relievers help the dog deal with what is a painful condition. Proper nutrition is a must; in severe cases, a feeding tube may be needed. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent jaw problems and therefore have trouble eating. Occasional cases are severe enough to call for jaw surgery. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: If your Westie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Cataracts: This common eye condition cause sopacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog"s eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. West Highland White Terriers are usually afflicted by juvenile cataracts. Pulmonary Fibrosis: Also known as Westie lung disease, this malady scars the supporting tissue in the air sacs and connective tissue of the lungs. This makes the lungs loose their elasticity, which prevents oxygen from passing normally into the blood. Symptoms vary from dog to dog — many dogs show none for years — but they can include loss of stamina, rapid breathing, "crackling" in the lungs, a dry cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Pulmonary fibrosis can lead to heart failure and other diseases as well. There is no cure and prognosis is always poor, so prevention is critical. Preventing any respiratory infections, limiting exercise, and keeping a healthy weight (or losing weight for overweight dogs) is key. The disease is sometimes treated by keeping the house cool and using bronchial dilators. Treatment has greater success if the disease is diagnosed early, before the scarring gets out of hand. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.
Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Westie doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Westie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Westie in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night.Some Westies like to swim, but they should be supervised at all times while doing so — they"re not as at home in the water as many of their canine cousins.
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.For more on feeding your Westie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
Westies have a double coat, with a short undercoat and a topcoat close to two inches long. That double coat protects him from inclement weather and from the teeth and claws of his quarry. The wee white one should, of course, always be white. Any other color is considered a fault in the show ring.His coat is easy to groom and requires regular brushing and trimming. Show dogs generally undergo stripping about twice a year, but most pet owners don"t bother. Trimming is usually needed on the feet, and around the ears and eyes. The hair on his head is often plucked to produce that definitive round shape you see on show dogs. His shedding tendencies range from low to nearly zero.The coat stays fairly clean and he should only be bathed when necessary. To keep that coat a nice sparkly white, the Westie requires some tidying and may need to be wiped down — sometimes frequently.Check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.
The West Highland White Terrier is a loving dog who is good with older children. But he must have adult supervision around children, particularly younger ones. Some breed books have overemphasized how well the Westie gets along with kids, so breed clubs recommend that all children in a Westie"s home be older than seven years of age. This dog can snap if annoyed — but if child and dog are properly supervised, the Westie can do well with children of all ages.A West Highland White Terrier is good with other dogs and is suited for multidog homes. However, an intact male generally dislikes other intact male dogs, Westie or otherwise. He can adjust to cats, but that"s easier if he"s been raised with them rather than adjusting to a late-life introduction; he has a strong prey drive and will chase cats who decide to run from him. A Westie should not be trusted with small animals because of his prey drive. Bred to go to ground after little varmints, and he can"t differentiate between the caged pet mouse in your child"s bedroom and a wild mouse that found its way indoors. If you want any small pet, including rabbits or birds, this isn"t the breed for you.

Nicknamed the "poor man"s Greyhound," the elegant yet powerful Whippet was probably created some time in the late 18th century for use by poachers in search of rabbits and other small game, as well as in "snap" contests, in which the goal was for the dog to snap up rabbits in a circle. They really came into their own, however, when it was discovered that they would chase a waving rag, and Whippet racing became popular among working class men. This medium-size hound has a short, dense coat in a variety of colors and markings covering a streamlined body. The Whippet is not a miniature Greyhound but was developed by crossing Greyhounds with smaller terriers and, later, Italian Greyhounds. The result was a sleek and beautiful dog who"s gentle and affectionate. The Whippet is often called the perfect all-purpose dog and is a keen competitor in agility, flyball, and lure coursing. Although they"re known for their independent temperament, which can make obedience training challenging, plenty of Whippets compete successfully in obedience trials. The Whippet usually gets along with other dogs and people, although early socialization — exposure to different people, sights, sounds, and situations — is necessary to keep your Whippet from becoming fearful of new situations. If you"re fond of cats, however, the Whippet may not be the best choice. This breed has a strong prey drive. Although some Whippets can live peacefully with cats and other small furry pets, there have been cases of Whippets killing family cats. You may be able to train and socialize your Whippet to accept the family cat, but it"s important to always supervise their interactions and never leave them alone together. That same prey drive that makes Whippets unsuitable to homes with cats makes them unsuitable to walks off leash. They will give chase if they see something worth chasing, and even a well-trained Whippet will disregard commands to come. Some have pursued prey for miles. Whippets enjoy daily walks, and an opportunity to run in a fenced yard or other confined area is always appreciated. An underground electronic fence is not sufficient to keep them contained; they"ll ignore the shock it gives in favor of going after any moving object. In the home, they"re gentle and undemanding, asking only to enjoy your company. With children they"re playful and mischievous. Their thin coats and affectionate nature make them unsuited to living outdoors. Whippets will snuggle with you on the sofa and warm your feet in bed at the end of an active day.
Whippets are suitable for apartment living if you have access to a safely fenced area where they can run. Whippets have low energy levels indoors, but will become overactive and destructive if their exercise needs are not met. When Whippets are not socialized properly they can become timid and stressed by changes in their environment. A properly socialized Whippet is a polite and undemanding dog who"s wonderful with strangers and other dogs alike. Whippets aren"t very good watchdogs as they rarely bark and are friendly toward everyone they meet. Whippets need daily exercise and will enjoy romping and running in a fenced yard or on leash. A Whippet should never be allowed to run off leash during walks. Whippets have a strong prey drive and will pursue other animals for several miles. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended for Whippets. They will ignore the shock if they see something to chase. A 5- or 6-foot fence should be enough to confine your Whippet. Whippets don"t shed excessively, and weekly brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. A Whippet"s thin skin is vulnerable to scrapes, tears, and nicks. Without daily exercise, a Whippet can become destructive. When their exercise needs are met, Whippets are generally quiet and calm dogs. Whippets are not outdoor dogs and should live in the house with their people. Whippets can suffer from separation anxiety and can become destructive when they do. It"s important to spend time with your Whippet and allow him the freedom to follow you from room to room or just snuggle at your feet, or more likely on the couch with you. Although Whippets do very well in multi-dog households, there have been cases of Whippets attacking and killing cats. There have been some Whippets who live happily with cats and other small furry pets, but these dogs were socialized to the animal at a very young age. If you have any other small pet besides another dog, please be aware that the Whippet might chase the other pet — or worse injure it  — if he"s not properly socialized or trained. Whippets are great companions for kids. Nonetheless, it"s important to teach your child how to properly interact with dogs and to never leave a young child alone with any breed of dog. Whippets get cold easily. Buy a sweater or coat for your Whippet to wear when it"s cold, wet, or snowy outside. To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.
The Whippet is a fairly modern breed, not much more than a couple of hundred years old. He was developed in Northern England, specifically Lancashire and Yorkshire, probably during the late 1700s, by crossing Greyhounds with fast, long-legged terriers. The result was a small, swift dog frequently used by poachers to hunt rabbits and other small game on local estates. The Whippet became popular with working men in Northern England, who spent their off hours seeing whose Whippets could kill the most rabbits or rats or whose was the fastest. Whippet races usually took place on a straight track that spread down roads and across fields. The Whippets would chase a rag or piece of cloth, and the contests became known as rag races. While the working class bred and perfected the racing and hunting spirit in the breed, it"s said that the upper class perfected the look of the breed as it is today by adding in some Italian Greyhound for refinement. England"s Kennel Club recognized the Whippet as a breed in 1891. The first Whippet to be registered with the American Kennel Club was a dog named Jack Dempsey, in 1888. Today the Whippet continues to inspire admiration for his stylish look, versatility, and devoted companionship. He"s ranked 60th among the 155 breeds and varieties recognized by the AKC.
A male Whippet is 19 to 22 inches tall at the shoulder; females are 18 to 21 inches. Their weight ranges from 18 to 48 pounds, with females being smaller. Males average 34 pounds, females 29 pounds.
Amiable, friendly, quiet, and gentle at home, the Whippet is intense in the chase. He requires a leash or a fenced yard to prevent him from taking off after any moving object, be it a bunny or a radio-controlled car. He doesn"t bark much, but he"s alert and makes an excellent watchdog. Guard dog? Not so much. He"ll happily show the burglar to the silver. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, Whippets need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Whippet puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
The Whippet is a generally healthy breed, and buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Whippet possible. A puppy from a reputable Whippet breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed. Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Whippets, you should expect to see health clearances from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old. The following conditions may affect Whippets: Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Whippets, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs. A normal dose for any other dog of the Greyhound"s size can kill a Greyhound, probably because of the breed"s low percentage of body fat. Choose a veterinarian who is aware of this sensitivity in sighthounds and will know how to dose your Greyhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, be sure to alert her to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog. Deafness: Deafness is uncommon in Whippets, but it occurs occasionally. Whippets who are deaf have special training and communication needs, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and your dog. Eye Diseases: Some Whippets may develop various eye defects. The breeder from whom you purchase your puppy should have eye clearances dated within the past year for both parents certifying that their eyes are normal. von Willebrand"s Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand"s disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.
Most important to a Whippet"s comfort is a nice, soft bed to cushion his body as well as access to your sofa and bed so he can cuddle with you. For cold-weather walks, he"ll need a sweater or coat to help him stay warm. He can"t tolerate being outdoors in the cold for long periods. A 5- to 6-foot fence will safely contain your Whippet in his yard. An underground electronic fence won"t. Your Whippet will readily ignore any shock in favor of giving chase. Give your Whippet a couple of 20- to 30-minute walks on leash daily. As often as possible, he"ll love the chance to run off leash in a fenced yard or park, but don"t be surprised if his burst of energy lasts only a few minutes. Be careful not to exercise your Whippet puppy too heavily. It"s important to avoid any strain on their joints or system. The general rule is five minutes for every month of age; in other words, a 5-month-old puppy should receive no more than 25 minutes of exercise per day. Whippets are easily housetrained, and using a crate will help. A crate is your Whippet"s safe place, and he won"t want to soil it. Putting him in it when you can"t watch him will ensure that he doesn"t have an accident in the house or chew up something he shouldn"t. A crate keeps him safe and both of you happy. Train your Whippet with praise, patience, and positive reinforcement. Whippets are smart and willing, but they also have a mind of their own. Reward them with food or praise when they do what you like, and never be harsh with them. They"re sensitive and will stop working for you if you yell at them, try to force them to do something, or hurt their feelings. With patience and consistency, you will find yourself the owner of a well-trained Whippet. After basic obedience you may want to pursue training in dog sports such as flyball, agility, and lure coursing.
Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into 2 feedings. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. For more on feeding your Whippet, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Whippet"s short, smooth coat lies close to the body. It can be any color or color combination. You"ll see him in black, white, red, fawn, blue, cream, brindle, and various combinations of those colors with a wide variety of spots, blazes, and patches. Keep your Whippet"s coat shiny with weekly brushing, using a rubber curry brush or hound glove. This will help to remove what little hair the breed sheds. You shouldn"t need to bathe your Whippet frequently unless he rolls in something stinky. Because of his thin coat, a Whippet"s skin is not as protected as that of other breeds. It"s common for Whippets to have nicks, scrapes, and tears that occasionally require stitches. Check him frequently for such injuries and to ensure that there are no infections in any of the nicks and scrapes. Otherwise, the only grooming he needs is dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Whippet"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Whippet enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. Begin accustoming your Whippet to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Whippets enjoy playing with kids. They"re not so large that they knock them over easily, and they"re not so small or delicate that they"re easily injured by them. That said, a few ground rules will keep everyone safe. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child. Whippets like the company of other dogs, and the presence of another dog or two can help keep them from being lonely if you"re gone during the day. They have a high prey drive, however, and aren"t really suited to living in homes with cats. It"s their nature to chase small furry creatures, after all. Some Whippets can learn to live peacefully with cats, especially if they"re brought up with them from puppyhood, but you should always supervise them when they"re together and separate them when you"re not home.

The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a medium-sized gundog breed of relatively recent vintage. The breed was developed near the end of the 19th century, and ever since then these dogs have awed people with their amazing ability to point and retrieve. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was originally used for hunting and would flush, point, and retrieve water fowl, game birds, and even hares. She"s been described as the "supreme gundog" and is still actively used in this role. She also makes an excellent family companion and enjoys any kind of work. Many Griffons have been successful in agility, tracking, and obedience. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is also a happy and loving breed. She generally gets along well with everyone, and although she"ll alert bark, she"s too gentle to be a strong guard dog. She does well in homes with children, but she prefers older children who know how to treat a dog properly. She usually gets along with other pets and dogs but still needs to be socialized, since some Griffons can be nervous when they"re introduced to new people, dogs, and situations. Griffons are an energetic breed and require daily exercise. They will do much better when they have an area to run in, and most exercise should be off-lead in the yard. They"re not recommended for apartments, and although they can adapt to city living, they do much better in the country. They thrive when they"re in the company of their families and are not the best breed to live outside in the yard or in a kennel. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is considered to be a nonshedder and should make an excellent dog for people with allergies. They do require some grooming with weekly brushings, and some stripping of the coat is required. Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are always eager to please and are very intelligent. Generally they"re easy to train and enjoy working closely with their owners. Despite the fact that the breed is young, it has gained popularity. Griffons are free from many inherited disorders, have a sense of humor that"s endearing, and they"re ideal hunting and family companions. If you"re looking for a high-energy, humorous hunting and family dog, this may be the breed for you.
Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are sporting dogs and consequently have a great deal of energy. They require daily exercise, preferably a minimum of 20 minutes off-leash per day. They can adjust to city living, although they"re not recommended for apartments. Griffons do best in the country where they have room to run. They also do better if they reside inside the home with their families, rather than living in the yard or a kennel. Wirehaired Pointing Griffons thrive when they"re with their owners; they can suffer from separation anxiety if they"re left alone for long periods at a time. Although they"re a nonshedding breed, Griffons still require some care. Expect to brush about once a week and to strip the coat several times per year. Wirehaired Pointing Griffons generally do well with other dogs and pets. Griffons enjoy being a companion breed. They have a loving and gentle temperament, making them good with children. They"re usually accepting of everyone, although some can be high-strung and nervous when introduced to new people, dogs, and situations. Early socialization is important with all breeds, and the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is no exception. Although they don"t have the suspicious nature of guarding breeds, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons do make excellent watchdogs since they will alert bark if someone comes to the house. Don"t expect them to carry it further and defend the house, though, since they tend to be easygoing with everyone. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a fairly young breed. Its development is attributed to one E.K. Korthals, a Dutchman who lived in France and was interested in creating the ideal gundog. There"s no clear evidence of what breeds he used, but some believe that he crossed the Otterhound and various Setters and Spaniels. It"s also probable that a Pointer was part of the mix. Starting his work in 1874, he eventually produced three dogs — Moustache I, Querida, and Lina — who in turn produced the best lines in the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon breed. Korthals was soon able to win over many people to his breed"s ability to point and retrieve. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon gained popularity quickly and the breed was first exhibited in a show early in its history. In 1887, the first Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was registered in the United States.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should be a medium-sized dog, males averaging 22 to 24 inches in height and females ranging from 20 to 22 inches. The average weight is 50 to 60 pounds.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is often described as the "supreme gundog," and her energetic and intelligent nature leaves little doubt as to why. She"s a versatile hunting dog who will both point and retrieve. She also makes a devoted and loyal family companion. She"s likely to have a sense of humor that will amuse everyone, and she won"t lose this trait with age. She"s likely to be loving and accepting of just about everyone, although some Griffons have been known to be nervous around strangers. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Griffon needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Griffon puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Griffons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Griffons will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Griffons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn"t fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don"t display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred, so if you"re buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is an intelligent breed, a quick learner who"s eager to please. It"s important to start training early, especially if you want to train her as a gundog. Socialization should also start as soon as vaccinations are complete, since Griffons — though not generally aggressive — can sometimes be high-strung or nervous around new people, dogs, and situations. Although Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are hardy enough to live in kennels, they do much better living indoors with their families. They thrive when they"re working closely with people. They also do better in the country where there"s room to run, but they can adapt to city living if they have a fenced yard. They"re not recommended for apartments. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon needs regular exercise, a minimum of 20 minutes of free play every day. She does better when she"s exercised off-lead in a yard; if you walk her on a leash, then you"ll need to spend more time, since she can"t receive the same workout as when she"s running loose. Like many sporting breeds, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a lot of energy but can be fairly calm when inside the house.
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Griffon in good shape by measuring her food and feeding her twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether she"s overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, she needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Griffon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a dense double coat. The undercoat is a thick, weather-resistant down. The topcoat is harsh in texture and consists of straight, wiry hair. It is medium in length and should never be curly. The Griffon should have eyebrows and a moustache, both of which are extensions of the undercoat. The preferred coat is a steel gray color with chestnut brown or roan markings. Colors that are less desired in the show ring are a uniform white or brown, or white and orange. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is considered to be a nonshedder; any hair loss is light. The coat should be combed through about once a week and stripped of dead or loose hair. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should only be bathed when necessary, since bathing can soften the natural harshness of its coat. The ears need special attention and must be kept clean and dry, especially after swimming. Otherwise they can trap water, dirt, and debris, leading to ear infections. Check them weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Brush your Griffon"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. Begin accustoming your Griffon to being brushed and examined when she"s a puppy. Handle her paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside her mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when she"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a very loving and gentle breed who does well with children. She"s better suited to homes where children are over the age of six, but they can adapt well to younger children who know how to properly treat a dog. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. The Griffon generally does well with other dogs and pets if she"s properly socialized from puppyhood.

Say his name like this: show-low-eats-queent-lee.” Or just call him the “show-low.” Whatever you call him, you’re sure to be intrigued by his unusual looks and restful but attentive personality.At first glance — and sometimes second and third glance — the Xolo does not have an attractive appearance. A wrinkled brow, squinty eyes, satellite-dish ears, a mohawk bisecting the top of the head, and a ratlike tail, not to mention the mostly hairless body, make the Xolo a dog that only his mother could love. Well, except for the people who prize the very differences that make him stand out from other dogs.Take a closer look, however, and you will see a lean, sturdy, well-muscled dog, with a body that is slightly longer than it is tall. A wedge-shaped skull gradually tapers to the muzzle. The expression is that of a smart and lively dog whose brow wrinkles when his attention is focused on something. Almond-shaped eyes range in color from yellow to black. The big ears, carried erect, have an elegantly thin and delicate texture. Puppies may have a wrinkly body, but as they grow into their skin the body smooths out. The feet are webbed, and the tail is long and fine.The Xolo has advantages that might be obscured by his unusual looks. He comes in three sizes — small, medium and large — and he has a calm personality and moderate exercise needs. This is a dog that won’t run you off your feet. The fact remains, however, that the Xolo is a primitive breed with the drive to chase other animals, including the neighbor’s cat, and an assertive and protective nature. In other words, he can be predatory, stubborn, and inclined to bite first, ask questions later if he thinks his person is in danger.You might think that the Xolo’s bald body makes him hypoallergenic, but hairlessness alone doesn’t mean he won’t make you sniffle and sneeze. He might be less likely to affect people with allergies, but he still produces dander, saliva and urine, all of which carry allergens. Be sure you meet several Xolos to make sure you don’t react to them.The Xolo is not an easy dog to rehome if you decide he’s not the right fit for you. Not everyone wants a dog with such unusual looks. But if you like the idea of having a living hotwater bottle with a reputation for a healing touch and the wherewithal to drive away evil spirits, the Xolo might be your dog.
The Xolo comes in three different sizes, so the breed is adaptable to any type of home. Native to Mexico and Central America, the Xolo is also known as the Mexican Hairless. The Xolo is thought to date to pre-Columbian civilizations. Although he’s known as a hairless breed, the Xolo also comes in a coated variety. The Xolo’s body is slightly longer than it is tall. In addition to being a great companion, the Xolo is also a protective watchdog. The Xolo’s lack of an insulating fur coat makes him feel warm to the touch, even though his body temperature is not any higher than that of other dogs. The Xolo was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2011 as a member of the Non-Sporting Group. There are fewer than 1,000 Xolos in the United States, with approximately 30,000 worldwide. The Xolo is not hypoallergenic, although his hairless body may be less likely to trigger allergies in susceptible individuals. The Xolo can have a strong prey drive and is likely to chase other animals.
Unlike dogs that were created by crossing or mixing two or more breeds, the Xolo is considered to be a natural breed, probably the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation. For centuries, the breed was molded by natural selection, not by human manipulation.Archaeological evidence suggests that the ancestors of the Xolo were dogs that accompanied migratory peoples across the Bering landmass — now submerged — from Asia to the New World. The dog we now know as the Xoloitzcuintli takes his name from the Aztec deity Xolotl, the god of fire and the escort of the dead to the underworld, and “itzcuintli,” the Aztec word for dog. These dogs of Xolotl were said to have healing powers, especially effective in cases of asthma, rheumatism and insomnia. In life, they frightened away evil spirits and intruders, and they were believed to serve as guides for the dead as they made their way from this world to the next. Unfortunately, that guide job usually involved being sacrificed to accompany the dead. Even less fortunately, Xolos were also considered good eats.Nonetheless, they thrived and went through periods of popularity, beginning in 1887, the first time the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club, which at the time referred to it as the Mexican Hairless. A Mexican dog named Mee Too was the first Xolo registered with the AKC. After that first flush of interest, little was heard from the breed, except for a brief time in the spotlight in 1940, when a dog named Chinito Jr. became the first and only Xolo to earn an AKC championship. Pet stores could barely keep the dogs in stock. Mexican artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo portrayed them in artwork. Fashion is fickle, though, and the Xolo again dropped from view, so much so that the AKC deregistered it in 1959.The breed might have disappeared altogether, but fans have brought it back from the brink of extinction. Today it is considered a national treasure in Mexico and was named dog of the year there in 2010. Approximately 30,000 are known to exist worldwide. The American Kennel Club brought the breed back into the fold in 2011. The Xolo currently resides at the intersection of rarity and popularity and sells for $2,000 to $2,500.
Xolos come in three sizes: Toy (at least 10 through 14 inches tall at the shoulder), Miniature (more than 14 through 18 inches tall) or Standard size (more than 18 through 23 inches tall). Their weight ranges from 10 to 50 pounds.
The adult Xolo is a calm dog who is aloof toward strangers but attentive toward his family. He usually chooses one person as his favorite but does not stint on affection toward other family members. A daily walk or an energetic playtime in a fenced yard satisfies his exercise needs. The rest of the time, he’ll enjoy lying in the sun or snuggling with you in an effort to stay warm. Take him with you whenever you can; he’s not fond of being left home alone.Xolos are excellent watchdogs and will alert you to anything that seems of concern. They are not nuisance barkers, however, so if they sound off, it’s a good idea to see what has disturbed them. Xolos are wary of strangers and are not the type of dog to make friends easily with people outside their family. They are also territorial toward other animals that come onto their property. Xolos that have not been well socialized may be aggressive toward people or dogs they don’t know.Bring up a Xolo with consistency and structure. Train using gentle positive reinforcement techniques, and this smart and sensitive dog will quickly learn what you like and don’t like. Once he knows that, a stern glance is generally all that’s needed to correct any misbehavior. An inexperienced dog owner can be easily manipulated by this breed, however, so a Xolo may not be the best choice for a first-timer.The Xolo is also highly athletic. Scaling a six-foot fence is nothing to an adult Xolo, and even puppies can scramble over three-foot fences. Be sure that your yard is escape-proof.Puppies are highly active and can be destructive if they aren’t kept busy with play and training. As they mature, they start to become the mellow dogs that typify the breed.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who"s available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Xoloitzcuintli need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Xoloitzcuintli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Xoloitzcuintli appear to be a healthy breed, and buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Xoloitzcuintli possible. A puppy from a reputable Xoloitzcuintli breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That"s because some health problems don"t appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it"s often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.Although the Xolo is not known to be prone to any serious genetic diseases, he has some traits that can affect his appearance and how you care for him. The first, of course, is hairlessness. A Xolo needs protection from the sun and from extremely cold weather. Apply sunscreen all over his body, especially if he is light-colored, and don’t leave him outdoors for long periods unless he has a shady place where he can retreat from the sun’s rays. In snowy or bitter cold weather, he’ll appreciate a sweater or coat to keep him warm. Indoors, let the Xolo go naked so he doesn’t overheat or develop skin problems from having his pores covered up. The good news is that his tough skin heals quickly if he gets a cut or abrasion.Another interesting facet to the Xolo is that hairlessness and dentition are genetically linked. Many adult hairless Xolos are missing their premolars, the bicuspids located between the canines and the molars. This does not affect their ability to eat and is not faulted in the show ring. Coated Xolos have full dentition.
The hairless Xolo has smooth but tough skin that fits closely to his body. What little hair he has adorns the top of the head, the feet and the last third of the tail, up to the tip. A coated Xolo is completely covered with short, smooth, close-fitting hair. In both varieties, the hair may be any color. Typically, it is black, gray-black, slate, red, liver or bronze. Some Xolos have white spots and markings.You might think that a hairless dog needs little to no grooming, but think again. It’s true that the Xolo often cleans himself like a cat and is unlikely to get fleas, but because he sweats through his skin and paw pads, it’s important to keep those areas clean. Wash the feet weekly to make sure the sebaceous glands remain unclogged. Bathe the dog every couple of weeks with a gentle dog shampoo. It is usually not necessary to apply oils or lotions to the skin. Wipe off any sunscreen after the dog has been outside.Trim the Xolo’s fast-growing nails weekly. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. The earlier you introduce your Xoloitzcuintli to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is for both of you.Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he"ll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Recommended daily amount: Depending on a Xolo’s size, he should eat 5/8 to 1.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.It"s easy to overfeed a Xoloitzcuintli, but obesity can stress his joints, so he shouldn"t be allowed to get fat. Keep your adult Xoloitzcuintli in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Xoloitzcuintli, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.

Xoloitzcuintlis are sometimes purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Xoloitzcuintlis end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Xoloitzcuintli has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they"ve already gone through the destructive puppy stage. Xolo Rescue League

The Yorkipoo loves people and fun, not necessarily in that order. He will delight his family and is always willing to perform tricks or show off for any visitor. His confidence keeps him from being overly snappy or aggressive; he"s happy in his own skin. The Yorkipoo can be an excellent companion to anyone looking for a small, confident dog with ample energy and even greater love. Like most of the Poodle hybrids, the Yorkipoo was originally designed to be a companion dog who could reside with allergy sufferers. The goal was a small dog who didn"t have the diseases of either the Yorkshire Terrier or Poodle, both of whom have suffered from health problems related to poor breeding or overbreeding. Both breeds are intelligent, though, and so is the Yorkipoo. Both breeds enjoy performance competition, such as agility and obedience — and so does the Yorkipoo. The Yorkie is more independent than the Poodle, so a Yorkipoo"s independence depends on the temperaments of the individual parents, the Poodle parent in particular. Yorkies don"t necessarily need to be on your lap, whereas Toy and Miniature Poodles are practically barnacles; with the Yorkipoo it all depends, again, on the parents. The Yorkipoo has low-dander, a low-shedding coat, and the small size of a toy breed. He"s happy in many different types of homes and can make an excellent companion for the elderly. With his gentle and loving disposition, the Yorkipoo has proven that he can be a successful therapy dog. Unfortunately, some dogs who weigh less than 10 pounds are clueless about their physical size and have been known to launch themselves at big dogs, and the Yorkipoo falls into this category. To protect your Yorkipoo from himself, introduce him to large dogs under supervision, before they interact on their own, to prevent potentially disastrous consequences. Dog parks intended for all sizes of dogs are not suited to canines weighing less than 10 pounds as it"s all too easy for them to be seen as prey, and for them to foolishly act aggressively toward a large dog. The Yorkipoo does well at training and is usually a quick learner. He can be stubborn, but this trait tends to rear its ugly head if training is harsh or becomes repetitive. Keep his lessons fun and interesting, and all should go easily. Consistent, positive reinforcement is the only way to train a Yorkipoo, especially since harsh corrections can seriously injure such a small dog. Even if injuries weren"t a concern, negative reinforcement doesn"t work with this dog because he"ll simply shut down. The Yorkipoo enjoys barking just a little too much ("I love this and I"m good at it!") and generally makes an excellent watchdog. He"ll alert bark when someone comes to the door or when he sees anything suspicious (and the chances are good he"s got a different definition of suspicious than you do). Some Yorkipoos can be trained to only bark once or twice, but many cannot. There"s a difference between an intentional breeding of carefully selected Yorkshire Terriers and Poodles versus a Poodle mix who"s called a Yorkipoo because no one has any clue what his background really is. When the mix works as intended, you get the intelligence and spirit of the Poodle and the bold terrier aspects of the Yorkie. Of course, when the mix doesn"t work, you can get a submissive, urinating fear-biter — but that can happen in any mixed breed, and in any purebred with unhappy genes.
The Yorkipoo is a designer dog and is the result of Yorkshire Terrier to Toy or Miniature Poodle breedings. There"s been an increase in multigenerational breeding (Yorkipoo to Yorkipoo), and also in Yorkipoo to Poodle or Yorkipoo to Yorkshire Terrier breeding; but many litters are first generation, the result of breeding two purebred parents. A Yorkipoo is active and energetic, as are both Poodles and Yorkies. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard. Barking is a favorite pastime. Occasionally a Yorkipoo can be trained to bark less, but expect to hear the noise whenever someone comes to the door. He has no clue that his bark doesn"t terrify anyone. He is a non- to low-shedder and can make an excellent companion for people with allergies. Daily brushing is needed to keep his fine, silky coat free of tangles and mats. Loving and gentle, the Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children. Like most toy breeds, he"s not recommended for homes with very young children. He"s easy to train if you use positive reinforcement. He"s got a stubborn streak, though, so expect some occasional resistance. The Yorkipoo can live very happily in an apartment. He generally does well with other dogs and pets. A companion dog, he may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
Like many designer breeds, the Yorkipoo is quite a young hybrid — he"s been popular for about a decade. He was originally developed to create a toy-sized dog who had a hypoallergenic coat and was free of the genetic disorders that affected the parent breeds, the Yorkshire Terrier and the Toy or Miniature Poodle. The success of crossing the Poodle with the Yorkshire Terrier has had mixed results, as with any hybrid; but the popularity of the Yorkipoo has grown. Today, most Yorkipoo litters are still the result of first-generation breeding, but some breeders have concentrated on multigenerational crosses in an effort to see the Yorkipoo produce offspring who confirm more consistently to the desired traits. There are no breed groups or registries for the Yorkipoo, but efforts have begun to create a direction for all Yorkipoo breeders; these will soon be available at a pending site called www.yorkipoo.org.
The Yorkipoo ranges from 7 to 15 inches in height and 3 to 14 pounds in weight. Size can differ between individuals, and the mature adult size is usually a reflection of the size of Poodle who was used for the crossbreeding.
The Yorkipoo is an active, affectionate, fun-loving dog who relishes the company of people. He is loving and loyal, a true companion dog who enjoys participating in family activities. He"s confident, thanks to his terrier heritage, but usually he"s also easygoing and less demanding than many other small breeds. He"s intelligent enough that, given consistent and positive training, he can be a perfect companion. He tends to be watchful and is happy looking at the world from the warmth of his owner"s lap, but he also enjoys exploring new things on his own. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who"s beating up his littermates or the one who"s hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who"s available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you"re comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Like every dog, the Yorkipoo needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Yorkipoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.
Yorkipoos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Yorkipoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it"s important to be aware of them if you"re considering this breed. If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Yorkipoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that"s often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It"s important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment. Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is a condition involving the hip joint. If your Yorkipoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy. Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It"s thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet. Hyperadrenocorticism: Also known as Addison"s disease, this is an extremely serious condition. It"s caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison"s disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it"s easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison"s, a series of tests can confirm the diagnosis. Atopic Dermatitis: This is an inherited skin disease that manifests itself as a predisposition to develop allergic symptoms following repeated exposure to some otherwise harmless substance, typically an allergen such as dust mites or pollen. It usually shows up by the time the dog is about three years old. An atopic animal usually rubs, licks, chews, bites, or scratches at his feet, muzzle, ears, armpits, or groin. This irritation causes hair loss and redness and thickening of the skin. Treatment involves removing the allergen as much as possible, and administering antihistamines and steroids. Use hypoallergenic shampoos on affected dogs.
The Yorkipoo is equally at home in a house or an apartment. He"s far too small to live outside; he must live indoors for both his physical and emotional well-being. He requires daily exercise, since he has a surprising amount of energy (read between those lines). A daily walk or romp in the yard will provide enough exercise to keep him healthy and happy. The Yorkipoo can also burn off steam by playing a game of fetch down a hallway. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Yorkipoo doesn"t have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn"t. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Yorkipoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Yorkipoo in a crate all day long, however. It"s not a jail, and he shouldn"t spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he"s sleeping at night. Yorkipoos are people dogs, and they aren"t meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.
Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl. Keep your Yorkipoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise. For more on feeding your Yorkipoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The coat of the Yorkipoo can range from straight to curly, and it should be luxuriously soft and silky in texture — running your fingers through it is heavenly. Although it"s different for every Yorkipoo, a puppy resulting from a multigenerational breeding (a Yorkipoo crossed with another Yorkipoo) is supposed to be odorless and nonshedding — although "nonshedding" is a fantasy, since every dog on the planet sheds at least a tiny bit. The Yorkipoo produces little dander, which is actually the trait that appeals to the allergic owner. The Yorkipoo is seen in a wide variety of colors, including cream, black, white, red, sable, apricot, tan, chocolate, gray, and silver. This versatile boy can sport multiple colors and a wide variety of markings, including black with tan points. Although he"s considered to be a non- to low-shedder, the Yorkipoo requires care in keeping that fine coat silky and healthy. Brushing him daily wards off tangles. Brush the hair away from the eyes to prevent it from becoming an irritant, which it will certainly be if this task is neglected. You can also protect his eyes by trimming the hair with a pair of scissors. His coat should be trimmed regularly to whatever length you prefer; that"s the beauty of a designer breed. No one is going to say you"ve clipped him incorrectly, because there is no "correct" cut. Bathing keeps his coat silky to the touch, but he only needs to be bathed when it"s necessary, not on a schedule. Brush your Yorkipoo"s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Toy breeds are notorious for dental problems, as it"s tough to get all those teeth into such a tiny mouth. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn"t wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog"s ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don"t insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Begin accustoming your Yorkipoo to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
The Yorkipoo is a gentle and loving dog who can do well with children. He"s not recommended for homes with very young children, since he can be easily injured when improperly handled. A Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion for an older, more considerate child. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he"s eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog"s food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child. In general, he does well with other dogs and pets (not that there are a lot of pets much smaller than he is, but he doesn"t grasp that). He may display prey drive due to his Yorkie parent, however. That may lead him to chase smaller pets and cats, but usually it"s in good fun.

The Yorkshire Terrier, nicknamed the Yorkie, seems quite full of himself, and why not? With his long silky coat and perky topknot, the Yorkshire Terrier is one of the most glamorous representatives of the dog world, sure to attract attention wherever he goes. Because he"s so small he often travels in style — in special dog purses toted around by his adoring owner.The long steel-blue and tan coat may be the Yorkie"s crowning glory, but it"s his personality that truly endears him to his family. Oblivious to his small size (weighing in at no more than seven pounds), the Yorkshire Terrier is a big dog in a small body, always on the lookout for adventure and maybe even a bit of trouble.Yorkshire Terriers are affectionate towards their people as one would expect from a companion dog, but true to their terrier heritage, they"re sometimes suspicious of strangers, and will bark at strange sounds and intruders. In consideration of your neighbors, it"s important to tone down their yappiness and teach them when and when not to bark.They also can be aggressive toward strange dogs, and no squirrel is safe from them.Despite their bravado, Yorkshire Terriers have a soft side too. They need lots of attention and time with their family. Long hours of being left alone is not for them. It"s not a good idea to over-protect your Yorkie, however; they"ll pick up on your feelings very quickly, and if your actions say the world"s a dangerous place for them, they can become neurotic.Because of their size, Yorkshire Terriers do better with older children who"ve been taught to respect them than with toddlers and small children. They can become snappish if they"re startled or teased.As long as they get some exercise every day — perhaps a good play session in the living room or a nice walk around the block — Yorkies make fine apartment dogs.No matter what home they live in, they"ll get along with other resident dogs and cats — so long as they were raised with them. Yorkies may become possessive of their owners if a new pet is brought into the house. Being terriers, they may want to challenge the "intruder," and if a fight breaks out, the terrier spirit is to fight to the death. Take a lot of care when you"re introducing a Yorkie to a new animal.A glamorous coat, small size, spunky personality, and undying loyalty to his people. Is it any wonder that Yorkshire Terriers are the second most popular dog breed in the U.S. today?
Yorkshire Terriers are known for being difficult to housetrain. Crate-training is recommended. Yorkshire Terriers don"t like the cold and are prone to chills, especially if they"re damp or in damp areas. Because of their small size, delicate structure, and terrier personality, Yorkshire Terrier generally aren"t recommended for households with toddlers or small children. Some Yorkshire Terriers can be "yappy," barking at every sound they hear. Early and consistent training can help. If you don"t feel qualified to provide this training, consult a professional dog trainer. Yorkshire Terriers can have delicate digestive systems and may be picky eaters. Eating problems can occur if your Yorkie has teeth or gum problems as well. If your Yorkie is showing discomfort when eating or after eating, take him to the vet for a checkup. Yorkshire Terriers think they are big dogs and will try to pick a fight with a big dog if allowed. Be sure to keep your Yorkie under control. Even better, try to socialize your Yorkie at an early age by taking him to obedience classes. Yorkies tend to retain their puppy teeth, especially the canines. When your puppy is around five months old, check his teeth often. If you notice that an adult tooth is trying to come in but the baby tooth is still there, take him to your vet. Retained baby teeth can cause the adult teeth to come in unevenly, which may contribute to tooth decay in later years. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they"re free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.
During the Industrial Revolution in England, Scottish workers came to Yorkshire to work in the coal mines, textile mills, and factories, bringing with them a dog known as a Clydesdale Terrier or Paisley Terrier. These dogs were much larger than the Yorkshire Terrier we know today, and it"s thought that they were used primarily to catch rats in the mills.The Clydesdale Terriers were probably crossed with other types of terrier, perhaps the English Black and Tan Toy Terrier and the Skye Terrier. The Waterside Terrier may also have contributed to the development of the Yorkshire Terrier. This was a small dog with a long blue-gray coat.In 1861, a Yorkshire Terrier was shown in a bench show as a "broken-haired Scotch Terrier." A dog named Huddersfield Ben, born in 1865, became a popular show dog and is considered to be the father of the modern Yorkshire Terrier. The breed acquired that name in 1870 because that"s where most of its development had taken place.Yorkshire Terriers were first registered in the British Kennel Club stud book in 1874. The first Yorkshire Terrier breed club in England was formed in 1898.The earliest record of a Yorkshire Terrier being born in the U.S. was in 1872. Yorkshire Terriers were able to compete in dog shows as early as 1878. In those early shows, Yorkshire Terriers classes were divided by weight — under 5 pounds and 5 pounds and over. Eventually, exhibitors settled on one class with an average of between 3 and 7 pounds.
Yorkshire Terriers should be 8 to 9 inches at the shoulder and weigh no more than seven pounds, with four to six pounds being preferred.Yorkies are inconsistent in size. It"s not unusual for a single litter to contain one Yorkie weighing less than four pounds, one who weighs five or six pounds, and one who grows to be 12 to 15 pounds.Beware of breeders who offer "tea cup" Yorkshire Terriers. Dogs who are smaller than the standard are prone to genetic disorders and are at a higher health risk in general.
Smart and self-assured, the Yorkshire Terrier is a combination of endearingly small size and adventurous terrier spirit. The breed displays a range of personalities. Some are cuddly and perky, wanting nothing more than to follow in their people"s footsteps throughout the day. Others are mischievous, outgoing, and into everything.Set limits, and your Yorkie will be a wonderful companion, but if you spoil him, watch out! Start training when they"re puppies, and you"ll have much better luck than if you let them have their way and then try to correct bad habits.Like all dogs, Yorkies needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they"re young. Socialization helps ensure that your Yorkie will be a friendly, well-rounded dog.
Yorkies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they"re prone to certain health conditions.If you"re buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy"s parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Yorkies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand"s disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org). Patellar Luxation: Also known as "slipped stifles," this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs" eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Portosystemic Shunt: Portosystemic shunt (PSS) is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That"s a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet. Hypoglycemia: Like many toy and small breed dogs, Yorkies can suffer from hypoglycemia when stressed, especially when they are puppies. Hypoglycemia is caused by low blood sugar. Some of the signs may include weakness, confusion, a wobbly gait, and seizure-like episodes. If your dog is susceptible to this, talk to your vet about prevention and treatment options. Collapsed trachea: The trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a "goose honk." Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically. Reverse sneezing: This condition is sometimes confused with a collapsed trachea. This is a far less serious condition and lasts only a few minutes. Reverse sneezing primarily occurs when your dog is excited or tries to eat or drink too fast. It also can occur when there are pollens or other irritants in the air. Secretions from the dog"s nose drop onto their soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe in an automatic reaction. This can be very frightening to your Yorkie, but as soon as he calms down, the reverse sneezing stops. Gently stroke his throat to help him relax. Eye infections, teeth, and gum problems also can occur.
Yorkshire Terriers enjoy taking a walk with you or playing outside, but since they"re very active while indoors, it doesn"t take a lot of effort to keep them well exercised.In general, Yorkies are receptive to training, especially if it brings them attention for performing cute tricks or performing in agility or obedience trials. They can be difficult to housetrain, however, because their "accidents" are so small and easy to clean up that people let it slide. That"s a mistake. It"s better to show them where to go from the beginning and reward them for doing their business in the right place. When you make the effort, you can end up with a very well trained Yorkie indeed.They definitely are housedogs and don"t tolerate extreme heat or cold well. Many people paper train their Yorkshire Terriers so they don"t have to take them outdoors when the weather is too hot or cold.Yorkies love squeaky toys, but it"s important to check the toy every few days to make sure they haven"t chewed them open and pulled out the squeaker. They especially enjoy fetching toys that you throw for them. If you"re crafty, consider crocheting a ball for your Yorkie — larger than a golf ball but smaller than a tennis ball — and stuffing it with used panty hose. He"ll love it!
Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don"t all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you"ll need to shake into your dog"s bowl.Take care that your Yorkie doesn"t get fat. Roly-poly is not a good look for this elegant breed. Keep your Yorkie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you"re unsure whether he"s overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can"t, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Yorkshire Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
The Yorkshire Terrier"s coat is long, silky, and perfectly straight without any hint of a wave. Show dogs have hair that reaches the floor. They have a single coat and shed very little.Puppies are born black, with the blue and tan coat developing gradually, usually after they"re a year old. Puppies that start to lighten before they"re a year old often turn gray rather than blue.From the back of the head to the tip of the tail, the hair is a dark steel-blue — sometimes described as the blue of a rifle barrel — with a bluish sheen when seen in the sunlight. The head is bright gold, not reddish, with tan hairs that are darker at the roots than at the ends. The headfall (the hair that falls over the face) is long with the same golden hue as the face.The hair is slightly darker at the base of the ears and on the muzzle. The tan on the head doesn"t extend past the ears, and no black hairs are mixed in with the tan. Yorkshire Terriers have tan legs as well, but the tan color doesn"t extend above the elbow.An interesting fact is that Yorkies tend to become lighter with age. Hormonal changes can also affect color. Females in heat go lighter, and then darken again after their season is over.Grooming a long-haired Yorkshire Terrier is not for the faint of heart, especially if he has a "soft" coat that tangles easily instead of a silky one! Even if you keep his coat trimmed short, gently brush your Yorkie"s coat every day to help prevent mats and keep him clean.Small breeds are prone to dental problems, and Yorkies are no exception. Yorkshire Terriers tend to form a lot of tartar on their teeth and can lose their teeth at a young age, so brush their teeth regularly and schedule a professional cleaning by your vet at least once a year.As part of the grooming process, check your Yorkie"s ears regularly. Look inside them and give them a good sniff. If they appear to be infected (have an offensive odor, redness, or a brown discharge), ask your vet to check them. If there"s hair in the ear canal, pluck it out with your fingers or ask your vet or groomer to do it for you.Bathe your Yorkie weekly to keep his coat beautiful and shiny. There"s no need to rub the coat to wash it. After wetting the coat and applying the shampoo, all you need to do is run your fingers through it to lift the dirt out. Apply conditioner, then rinse thoroughly.When you"re drying your Yorkie, spray the coat with a light conditioner. Give the coat a spritz with a light conditioner when you"re brushing him as well. Never brush a dry or dirty coat or you"ll break the hair.Trim your Yorkie"s nails after each bath to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you hear them clicking on the floor, they"re too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you"re not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.When you"re grooming your Yorkie, be sure to check the anal area and trim around it with scissors if the hair"s getting too long. Usually trimming about a half inch of hair around it is enough.After you"ve brushed your Yorkie and he"s dry, collect the hair on the top of his head, starting at the outer corner of the eye, going back at an angle toward the center of head, then back down to the outer corner of the other eye. Brush this hair up and fasten it with a latex band, and then add your favorite bow.Begin accustoming your Yorkie to being brushed and examined when he"s a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you"ll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he"s an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.
Because of their small size, Yorkies aren"t suited to families with young children. Most breeders won"t sell puppies to people whose children are younger than 5 or 6 years old. It"s just too easy for children to drop them, step on them, or hold them too tightly.Yorkies can get along well with other pets, including cats, if socialized to them at an early age. They"re bold in going after strange dogs, however, even those that outweigh them by a factor of ten, and protecting them from themselves becomes second nature to people with Yorkies.
